Will trans-national corporations rule the roost? (U)\n(U) The report \"Tackling Tomorrow Today: Alternative Futures and Convergent Technologies of 2020\" has just been published. It is the outcome of an Agency-wide outreach to help NSA and the National Intelligence Council in its \"2020 project\" to identify importance influences, particularly in the area of technology, that will shape our world between now and 2020 and impact on national security. It was produced by the SIGINT National Intelligence Officer (SINIO) Council in partnership with the SID Planning, Programming, and Performance Office (S01X) and Toffler Associates.\n(U) NSA's involvement included:\n\n- hosting a Technology 2020 conference with technology leaders from around the nation;\n- identifying key drivers;\n- developing 4 alternative scenarios;\n- holding numerous outreach sessions and interviews to engage NSA analysts, linguists, technologists, and managers;\n- sponsoring a 2020-related essay contest with the International Affairs Institute;\n- and maintaining an interactive web-site.\n(U) With the underlying goal of providing information to identify signposts and minimize surprise, Tackling Tomorrow Today identifies:\n\n\n## Three Drivers:\n\n- Focus: individuals, groups, and nations could be highly cohesive and pay single-minded attention to a threat or be disjointed with conflicting ambitions and low cohesiveness\n- Tech-Comm-Plexity : technology and communications could accelerate and interact creating new opportunities or could stall and society would live on old ideas\n- Distribution of power, knowledge, and money (PKM): PKM could be concentrated among elites or could be broadly distributed\n\n\n## Four Alternative Scenarios:\n\n| World | Drivers | Character | Significant Differences |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Trans- <br> National <br> Corporate <br> Cowboys | Focus is <br> High <br> Tech- <br> Comm- <br> Plexity is <br> Strong <br> PKM <br> Distribution <br> is Little | Corporate interests take a free hand in shaping the international environment. | Corporations dominate business and politics.
