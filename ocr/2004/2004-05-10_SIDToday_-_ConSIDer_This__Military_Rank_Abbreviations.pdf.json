Each military service uses its own abbreviation scheme. For example, the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps all use the rank of lieutenant colonel, but they abbreviate this rank as LTC, Lt Col (with a blank space), and LtCol (without a space), respectively.\n(U) As you can see in the tables below, the Army and Navy use upper case in their abbreviations, while the Air Force and Marine Corps generally use a combination of upper and lower case. Note also that certain ranks are used by only one military branch; this is especially true in the case of the Navy:\n\n| PAY GRADE | ARMY | NAVY | AIR FORCE | MARINE CORPS |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n\nEnlisted:\n\n| E-1 | PV1 | SR | AB | Pvt |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| E-2 | PV2 | SA | Amn | PFC |\n| E-3 | PFC | SN | A1C | LCpl |\n| E-4 | CPL/SPC | PO3 | SrA | Cpl |\n| E-5 | SGT | PO2 | SSgt | Sgt |\n| E-6 | SSG | PO1 | TSgt | SSgt |\n| E-7 | SFC | CPO | MSgt | GySgt |\n| E-8 | MSG/1SG | SCPO | SMSgt | MSgt/1stSgt |\n| E-9 | CSM/SGM | MCPO | CMSgt | SgtMaj/MGySgt |\n\nWarrant Officers:\n\n| W-1 | WO1 | (not used) | none | WO1 |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| W-2 | CW2 | CWO2 | none | CWO2 |\n| W-3 | CW3 | CWO3 | none | CWO3 |\n| W-4 | CW4 | CWO4 | none | CWO4 |\n| W-5 | CW5 | CWO5 | none | CWO5 |\n\nOfficers:\n\n| O-1 | 2LT | ENS | 2nd Lt | 2ndLt |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| O-2 | 1LT | LTJG | 1st Lt | 1stLt |\n| O-3 | CPT | LT | Capt | Capt |\n| O-4 | MAJ | LCDR | Maj | Maj |\n| O-5 | LTC | CDR | Lt Col | LtCol |","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2339,"width":1653}},{"index":1,"markdown":"| O-6 | COL | CAPT | Col | Col |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| O-7 | BG | RADM(L) | Brig Gen | BGen |\n| O-8 | MG | RADM(U) | Maj Gen | MajGen |\n| O-9 | LTG | VADM | Lt Gen | LtGen |\n| O-10 | GEN | ADM | Gen | Gen |\n\n(U) The Coast Guard ranks are the same as those of the Navy.\n(U) If you'd like to see these listed in a different format (or to see what the abbreviations break out to!), see this web page.

Promotions to this rank are taking effect for the first time during the FY04 selection board cycle.\n\n# \"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms).\" \n\nDYNAMIC PAGE -- HIGHEST POSSIBLE CLASSIFICATION IS TOP SECRET // SI / TK // REL TO USA AUS CAN GBR NZL DERIVED FROM: NSA/CSSM 1-52, DATED 08 JAN 2007 DECLASSIFY ON: 20320108","images":[],"dimensions":{"dpi":200,"height":2339,"width":1653}}],"model":"mistral-ocr-2503-completion","usage_info":{"pages_processed":2,"doc_size_bytes":46977}}
