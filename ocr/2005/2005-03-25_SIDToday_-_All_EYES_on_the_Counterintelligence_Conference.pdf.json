From my perspective, the conference was truly a success and we look forward to following through with the actions that were derived from the conference, as well as looking for other opportunities to collaborate on the CI topic.\n\n## Short summary from GCHQ (U)\n\n(TS//SI) It was heartening to see how the levels of commitment from the non-UK/US partners had raised considerably since last year with significant signs of topic maturity shown by agency representatives, in particular, CSE (Canada's Communications Security Establishment).\n(TS//SI) A well-pitched and informative keynote address by SIS (the British Security Intelligence Service) provided clarification of HUMINT requirements from SIGINT and set just the right scene for cross-partner discussion.\n(TS//SI) The range of traditional CI topics discussed was extended to include a half-day briefing on how Electronic Attack is viewed and worked in each agency -- a good airing for the SIGINT/Information Assurance hinge.\n(TS//SI) There were several joint actions agreed by the 5 partners -- all of which will be worked via the newly established Collaboration Working Group. These focus on:\n\n1. Producing a matrix to show where we have overlap and underlap of National Requirements.\n2. Reviewing the ECI (Exceptionally Controlled Information) associated with CI work with a goal of coming to a mutual understanding and application across the 5 agencies, and the possibility of including some Electronic Attack casework.\n3. Sharing language assets and intelligence analysts.\n4. Working towards a common understanding in our CI relationships with Third Parties (the Crown Jewels concept).\n(U//FOUO) Two partners offered to host next year's Conference -- NZ and Canada -- it was agreed (amicably) that CSE should host.
