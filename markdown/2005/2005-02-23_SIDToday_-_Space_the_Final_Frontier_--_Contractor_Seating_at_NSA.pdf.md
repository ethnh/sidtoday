(U) Space, the Final Frontier -- Contractor Seating at NSA
FROM:
SID Facility Requirements (S01R3)

The new process for managing where contractors sit (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) Those of you who have been here awhile and follow trends have observed that we expanded in the 80's, retracted in the 90's, and are expanding again. Unfortunately, additional space has not been added as quickly as our requirements have grown and many organizations are feeling the pain. The Agency space shortage is not expected to improve for several more years in spite of several initiatives: NBP 140 has opened, APS 10 will be opening in February, NBP 318 is under construction and a renewed emphasis on evaluating contracts for off-site performance is underway. As the number of people grows finding space for them is a challenge.
(U) How are we dealing with our contracting space needs? Contractors who are part of a new or increased contract effort will reside in NSAW spaces ONLY as an exception (reference EXECmessage-56: "Criteria for Contractor Occupation of NSA Space" posted on November 19, 2003). The criteria can be found at the following address:
(U) The SID Chief of Staff (CoS) has established a contractor desk management process that applies to all new contract initiatives, existing contracts that are approaching renewal, and contracts whose scope allow for an increase in contractor seating at NSAW. It does not apply to instances in which a contractor is replacing an existing contractor as part of an on-going contract.
(U//FOUO) The basic process is to compose a point paper that justifies why contractors must have desks in Agency spaces and route that through your chain of command using an SPF (Staff Processing Form). It will be coordinated with S01R3 (SIGINT Workforce \& Support Requirements) and a decision on approval made by the SID CoS. If you are responsible for any of the contracting actions addressed above, please review the documents posted under the Contractor Desk Management Process at the following address:
