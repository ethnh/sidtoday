(U) MGQ's Notes from the Field - Part 1

FROM: MG Richard Quirk
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 04/01/2005

Over the next twelve days, a good-sized team from the SIGINT Leadership will be touring the CENTCOM area, looking in on our customers, partners, and deployed cryptologic teammates to learn how we are doing and how we can improve. We plan to keep you informed through SID today . I hope you enjoy the notes and articles.(S)
(S) I'm very happy to be writing you tonight from the "Water Palace" in Baghdad. This has been an impressive day. Its most gratifying aspect has been the chance to talk to, and listen to, the SIGINTers and Information Assurance Personnel who are forwardbased in Qatar and Iraq. They are very excited about the positive contribution that they are able to make over here.
(S) Poised at the intersection between the Cryptologic Community and our warfighting customers, they keenly sense the value of their work in a way that is sometimes difficult back home. They are learning a great deal that they know will make them better intelligence professionals. Meanwhile, they are rewarded each and every day when their customers take their advice and run operations based upon it. As they participate in operations with a wide range of appreciative partners, they are building experiences and memories that they will treasure for the rest of their lives. They are a valued part of this combat team, and they have a lot to be proud of. It is so great for me to hear them praise the other members of the global Cryptologic Team as they modestly give the credit to those of us who serve elsewhere in the SIGINT System.
(U//FOUO) From this vantage, I can see the evolution of the US SIGINT System into "one single, global, integrated, self-aware, self-synchronizing system", as Lt Gen Hayden likes to describe it. We are all making good progress toward this network-centric model because of your brilliant work and theirs as well.
(U) Our Transformation is coming about amidst major changes across all military and civilian efforts. It is clear in the way we are engaging this new kind of enemy. Our performance makes me proud, enthusiastic, and confident in the future.
(S) We are witnessing the emergence of a new kind of SIGINT enterprise. The transformation is real and it's happening here in Iraq (and elsewhere in the SIGINT enterprise)! Of course, it's still a work in progress, but on our best days (and there are more great days than bad), we are truly working as a single team. It's really exciting to see the impacts this new approach is having on how and what we are delivering to the nation!
(U) It is a different kind of military and civilian leadership and a different kind of troop (civilian and military as well) that is advancing democracy in Iraq today. It's far more agile, thinks

more broadly, and is far more integrated than the world has ever seen before! It's also driven by a new kind of intelligence...intelligence that is no longer simply about answering one-off customer intelligence needs, but is instead about driving the mission with insight and actionable information that leads directly to decisions, options, and outcomes at every level of the effort. This is what has me so excited!
(U) My thanks to all of you for all that you are doing for our nation, and especially in the Global War on Terrorism. To all members of the US Cryptologic System, keep up your great work!
(U) Over the next days, I will try to send you updates on specific points of interest from the trip. Other members of the team may also send articles.
(U) Tonight, as a first installment, I am including a short article* that I asked to write from his current job as MENA analyst on the Baghdad CSG. He is a true star out here, not only because of the products he has personally produced, but also because of the professional training he has provided to so many SIGINT analysts deployed over here.
