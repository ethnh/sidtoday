(C) Good Chemistry: NSA Hosts Largest-Ever International CBW Analyst Conference

FROM:
SIGINT National Intelligence Officer, Proliferation of WMD (S17)
Run Date: 11/09/2005
(C) NSA recently played host to chemical and biological warfare analysts from around the world at a weeklong conference at Ft. Meade. It ranked among the largest gathering of CW and BW experts anywhere and was the biggest such conference ever held at NSA.
(C) The "QWSSIC WP/5"** meeting, held from 24 to 28 October 2005, was a conference by analysts for analysts. British, Canadian, Australian, and US SIGINT, HUMINT, and imagery analysts presented over 100 briefings over the course of the week and engaged in countless side discussions on a wide range of topics.
(C) The conference gave NSA analysts the opportunity to put faces to counterparts from around the IC and the world, many of whom they had known only from emails and names at the bottom of reports. Impromptu discussions, working lunches, and visits to the NSA workspaces were the order of the day.
(C) The conference was deemed a huge success by all, and everyone's looking forward to the next WP/5 meeting, slated for Australia in 2007 (if they can get the funding!).
