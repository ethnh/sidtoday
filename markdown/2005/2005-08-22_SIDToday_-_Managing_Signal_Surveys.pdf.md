(U//FOUO) Managing Signal Surveys
FROM:
Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (S3C)
Run Date: 08/22/2005
(TS//SI) Customers can now see where Data Acquisition's (S3) worldwide SIGINT surveys are taking place, via a customer portal.
(U//FOUO) As described last month in SID today (see article), the Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) has recently undergone a transformation that includes a realignment of internal resources and the creation of a new centralized function within the CSRC's Office of Collection Initiatives \& Strategies (CIS): the Signal Survey Management (SSM) Portfolio.
(S//SI) The new SSM portfolio's mission is to:

- be the focal point for all signal surveys supporting the Intelligence Community (IC),
- govern signal surveys for Data Acquisition through the Agency-wide Signal Survey Committee (SSCOM), and
- maintain a robust interactive web-based knowledge base for all surveys.

This website includes survey activity, survey collection assets, survey results, and POCs.
(S//SI) The CSRC SSM portfolio chairs the SSCOM and adjudicates the signal survey nominations from the committee members via the SSM's Executive Secretariat. The SSCOM membership is composed of representatives from every major SIGINT Directorate (SID) organization, including Customer Relations, Analysis \& Production lines, and numerous "Get It" enablers**. Other SSCOM voting members are Pacific Technical Center (PTC), NCEUR/European Technical Center (ETC); representatives from each Second Party Partner, and, most recently, the Central Command (CENTCOM) and Pacific Command (PACOM).
(TS//SI) The new SSM portfolio also provides its customers a new capability, the opportunity to review locations of ongoing signal surveys worldwide via an interactive web-based map. The accompanying graphic represents SSM's worldwide visual depiction of current Signal Surveys in 2005. This new capability provides customers, planners, managers, and tasking enablers an intuitive tool for understanding and correlating surveys prior to creating requirements that potentially may already be satisfied by another access provider. The survey map graphic is designed along Areas Of Responsibility (AOR) mirroring the Combatant Commander's missions. To view this interactive display and other SSM information, click on "Go SSM."
