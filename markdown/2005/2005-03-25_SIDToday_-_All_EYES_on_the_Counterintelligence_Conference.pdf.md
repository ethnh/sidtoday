# (U//FOUO) All EYES on the Counterintelligence Conference 

FROM: Mary Jo Coyner

Second annual 5-EYES Counterintelligence Conference was held 1 and 2 March in Cheltenham, England (U//FOUO)
(TS//SI) The theme of the conference, jointly hosted by NSA and GCHQ*, was "Towards a Joint Understanding of Counterintelligence -- Forging Common Ground and Partnerships." Participants in the conference held true to realizing the theme as each of the five partners were prepared for substantive and honest discussions about their respective CI programs, a marked change from the first conference which was held here at NSA last April and could best be described as exploratory.
(U//FOUO) I led the NSA delegation and was accompanied by
and from my Product Line, from the NTOC*, from the NSACC*, and from FAD*.
(TS//SI) Below please find a short summary of the conference which was prepared by
my counterpart at GCHQ, and which she shared with her senior leadership. From my perspective, the conference was truly a success and we look forward to following through with the actions that were derived from the conference, as well as looking for other opportunities to collaborate on the CI topic.

## Short summary from GCHQ (U)

(TS//SI) It was heartening to see how the levels of commitment from the non-UK/US partners had raised considerably since last year with significant signs of topic maturity shown by agency representatives, in particular, CSE (Canada's Communications Security Establishment).
(TS//SI) A well-pitched and informative keynote address by SIS (the British Security Intelligence Service) provided clarification of HUMINT requirements from SIGINT and set just the right scene for cross-partner discussion.
(TS//SI) The range of traditional CI topics discussed was extended to include a half-day briefing on how Electronic Attack is viewed and worked in each agency -- a good airing for the SIGINT/Information Assurance hinge.
(TS//SI) There were several joint actions agreed by the 5 partners -- all of which will be worked via the newly established Collaboration Working Group. These focus on:

1. Producing a matrix to show where we have overlap and underlap of National Requirements.
2. Reviewing the ECI (Exceptionally Controlled Information) associated with CI work with a goal of coming to a mutual understanding and application across the 5 agencies, and the possibility of including some Electronic Attack casework.
3. Sharing language assets and intelligence analysts.
4. Working towards a common understanding in our CI relationships with Third Parties (the Crown Jewels concept).
(U//FOUO) Two partners offered to host next year's Conference -- NZ and Canada -- it was agreed (amicably) that CSE should host. H/OPI RUCI, GCHQ)
