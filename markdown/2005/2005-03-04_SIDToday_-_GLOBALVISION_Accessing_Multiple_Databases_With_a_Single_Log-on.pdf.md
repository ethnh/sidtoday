New federated query capability for analytic databases released this week (C)
(C) On February 28, Analysis \& Production (S2) released the first GLOBALVISION analytic tool: a single sign-on federated query capability. With this release, users will be able to access the following databases from a single pull-down menu: ASSOCIATION, FASCIA, CONTRAOCTAVE, DISHFIRE, HOMEBASE, MAINWAY, OCTAVE, PINWALE, SPOTBEAM, SPEEDBUMP and YACHTSHOP. GLOBALVISION has selected MAINWAY's Sigint Navigator as the vehicle for delivery of this single sign-on federated query capability. The new version (4.0) of SigNav provides access to many of the databases and tools analysts need to do their jobs from a single desktop application, with a single log-on. The good news is if you already have a SigNav or GLOBALREACH account, you automatically have a GLOBALVISION account.
(S//SI) This GLOBALVISION/SigNav release also contains a number of new features that simplify access to other tools. For example, while contact-chaining in GLOBALVISION/SigNav, analysts will be alerted to the availability of some forms of content and will be able to view that content using the CREST and UIS tools with a couple of mouse-clicks, if you already have an account with those data marts. Also, contact-chaining results in GLOBALVISION/SigNav can now be easily viewed using Analyst Notebook. The goal is to allow analysts to spend more time analyzing the data and less time wrestling with the tools. This release of GLOBALVISION/SigNav is a big step in that direction.
(S) For more information on these new features, and for details on how to get an account, see the GLOBALVISION or MAINWAY webpage ("go GLOBALVISION" or "go mainway"). Training and Demos can be scheduled by clicking on the training calendar link on the MAINWAY webpage. Feedback is welcome and can be sent to mailto

Background:
(S) The GLOBALVISION partnership is facilitating the integration of legacy user interfaces and data marts. The partnership is capitalizing on the software development capabilities of Target Development Services along with the MAINWAY and HOMEBASE programs to enhance analysts' abilities to access the right data with the right tools. One of the first accomplishments of this partnership is the deployment of the single sign-on federated query capability. GLOBALVISION represents the "righthand side" of the APATS strategy and has three spirals scheduled for release through July 2005, defined in the Requirements Document dated January 18, 2005.
