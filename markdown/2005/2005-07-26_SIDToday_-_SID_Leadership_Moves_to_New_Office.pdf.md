FROM: SIGINT Communications

Run Date: 07/26/2005

SID is on the move -- literally. (U)
(U//FOUO) As of this morning (26 July), the SID "front office" has moved to a new suite: 2W034 in the OPS1 Building. Here's a Q\&A on the move:

# (U) Who moved? 

- A: The SIGINT Director (Major General Quirk), Deputy Director (Charlie Meals), SID Chief of Staff (Karyn Vice), SID Technical Director (Dave Hurry) and their personal staffs. Also, the IMT (Issue Management Team) coordinators, Jeanne Zimmer and WYNWYN, are moving to the new spaces.


## (U) Why did they move?

- A: All of building OPS1 is being renovated in stages, and the old SID suite was simply next on the schedule. Plans call for some architectural elements of the old suite (such as the SIGINT Director's office -- rich in history) to be retained in those original spaces.


## (U) What are their new phone numbers?

- A: MG Quirk, Charlie Meals and Karyn Vice are keeping the same phone numbers -- the numbers have been transferred to the new spaces.

Dave Hurry and the IMT coordinators will get new numbers. (People calling their old phone numbers will hear a message directing them to the new numbers.)
(U) What will happen to their old offices (2W106 and nearby rooms) when renovations are complete?

- A: Plans are not definite at this time.
