(U) Administrative leave is authorized for employees activated to perform emergency rescue work when directed by federal, state, or local authorities. Up to 10 days may be granted with appropriate documentation (i.e. an activation letter). Employees must receive approval from their supervisor and the chief of MD6. Officially recognized programs include:
- State National Guard,
- Red Cross,
- Rescue Squad,
- swift water rescue teams,
- disaster medical assistance teams,
- State National Response Team,
- firefighters, etc.
(U) Administrative leave is not authorized for individuals who volunteer outside an officially recognized program.
- (U) Can civilian employees enlisted with Maryland National Guard receive additional leave?
(U) Maryland National Guard members activated in support of Hurricane Katrina are deemed to be activated under 5 USC 6323(b). Thereby, they are entitled to 22 days of military leave which is processed upon return to active duty, due to a salary off-set (see PMM 363 Section 4-6 "Crediting Military Pay" for additional information).
