(U//FOUO) This article was found deep in the SID today archives... Actual foreign news reports with "little known" facts about NSA (taken from FBIS):
"In the direction of the Baltic Sea [as published*] and several miles from Washington, D.C., ...in the United States, there is a military installation-like, unapproachable area called "Fort Meade," and they say that this area is not even indicated on maps and not many people are actually interested in it."

Interview with Tomislav Kresovic, political analyst for the Belgrade-based Bina Agency: "Our people idealize the role of the CIA to such an extent that they consider it to be the biggest and best secret service in the world. However, I believe that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is the most powerful espionage agency and that it rules the world at the moment, because it is capable of achieving total surveillance of our planet and implementing a strategy of total espionage."

"They did their work in silence, says the plaque dedicated to those who have fallen that greets the few who succeed in entering Crypto City, the city of secrets. It consists of 60 buildings surrounded by barbed wire and maple trees located between Washington and Baltimore. If, instead of being ignored by all the maps, it were a real city, it would be the second largest in Maryland. "Every day 38,000 employees, sworn not to reveal what they do even to their children, park their cars around the two black buildings that hide two bunkers that are proofed against any kind of interception. Inside work spies who have such abstruse titles as 'in charge of anonymity,' or who produce newsletters with a warning under the letterhead: 'Destroy after reading.' "

*(U) Footnote:
In case you are wondering about the seemingly bizarre reference to the Baltic Sea, a reader sent in the following possible explanation:
"Balti-more = Baltic Sea; "Mare" is the Latin word for "Sea" used in naming the dark, flat regions of Earth's moon... "More" is "sea" in Russian, and maybe some other languages as well... To say that Fort Meade is between Washington DC and the Baltic Sea is not an error of geography is much as it is a matter of "excessive translation." It's sort of like attributing angelic powers to anyone named "Michael."
