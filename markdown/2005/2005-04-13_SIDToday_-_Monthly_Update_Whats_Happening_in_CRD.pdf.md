(U) Monthly Update: What's Happening in CRD

FROM:
SID/Deputy Director for Customer Relationships (S1)
Run Date: 04/13/2005

A rundown on recent events in S1 (U)

# Senior Leadership Activities 

(U//FOUO) Assistant Deputy Director Charles Berlin and I have been on the road visiting our partners and customers near and far to discuss the Customer Relationships Directorate's (CRD) role in mission alignment. CRD's job, in a nutshell, is to help deliver the right information in the right format to the right customers to safeguard our nation's security. How will we do that in future? Our goal is to create a global network of "hubs," with each focused on our customer relationships in a particular region. CRD leadership here at Fort Meade will assign responsibilities within this network, but the actual operations will be carried out wherever it makes the most sense.
(U//FOUO) The move to a global, netcentric system presents a lot of challenges. We must gain an even deeper understanding of each customer's mission, key decision points, priorities, information needs and opportunities, so that we can get them the information they need to do their jobs better. With that in mind, I visited NSA/CSS Hawaii and Charles visited NSA/CSS Georgia, Texas and Colorado. During our visits, we discussed the functions and operating principles for a global Customer Relationships organization.

## Operations

(U//FOUO) The Requirements Analysis Center (formerly S16) merged into the Customer Gateway (S11) organization -- it will now be known as S114 -- creating a more comprehensive focus on our internal and external customers. By blending these two organizations, we will be able to better integrate the results of our customer engagement activities, gain the deep understanding of our customers needs required to help them achieve their mission success, provide better direction to the SIGINT system on priorities and focus areas, and evaluate customer satisfaction with SIGINT products and services.
(U//FOUO) Meanwhile, Customer Response (S12) has completed a thorough reengineering process to align with their future vision and improve service. They have reorganized and renamed themselves Information-Sharing Services to reflect the Agency transformation from strictly a product-publishing entity to an information-sharing focus. They will continue to provide tools, policy and services to enable efficient and effective movement of information to the customer/partner domain. For details of the changes visit their website at go S12.
(U//FOUO) We are also re-examining how we work across the services to plan and implement a future global strategy for national-tactical integration. The Military Integration (S13) and National Tactical Integration Offices (S14) are developing a comprehensive plan to make the integration of cryptologic forces throughout the world as seamless, routine, and efficient as possible. A major new role will be to "organize, train and equip" and connect every tactical SIGINTer with every other SIGINTer in the USSS.

## Personnel Moves

(U//FOUO) Dr. Prescott B. Winter has moved from Chief of S12 (Information-Sharing Services) to Chief of the newly created NSA/CSS Commercial Solutions Center, a blend of SID and IAD organizations dealing with commercial enterprises. comes to us from S01 where he was Associate Deputy for Integrated Planning to take over as Chief of S12.
(U//FOUO) has taken over as chief of the Requirements Analysis Cell (S114). $\square$ has moved from Acting Chief of the RAC to become Chief of Staff for the NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority.

This is the first in a series of monthly articles we hope to present from each of the SID Deputy Directorates (aka "bubbles" -- S1, S2, and S3). They will contain news blurbs to keep everyone across SID up-to-date on important operational events, personnel moves, management activites, etc. Let us know what you think of these "bubble wrap-ups" -- The editor (U)
