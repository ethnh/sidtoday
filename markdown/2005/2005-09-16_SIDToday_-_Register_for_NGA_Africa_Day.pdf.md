The conference will address contemporary political, military, economic, and other issues pertinent to today's Africa. The purpose of this conference is to promote issue awareness and collaboration within the Intelligence Community on a full spectrum of Africa issues, as well as to build robust analyst networks and to serve the IC partners and military customers. This venue provides an opportunity for analysts from across the IC to meet customers and decision makers.

NSA's featured speaker is Mr. NGA SINIO for Africa, who will address some the challenges encountered in producing SIGINT on Sub-Saharan targets and the measures NSA has taken to overcome them. The brief will present a snapshot of NSA's current posture, and how issues such as the Global War On Terrorism and globalization are being addressed.
