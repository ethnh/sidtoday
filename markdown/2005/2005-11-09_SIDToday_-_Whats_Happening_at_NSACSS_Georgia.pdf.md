(U//FOUO) What's Happening at NSA/CSS Georgia
FROM:
D/Chief of Staff, Directorate of Operations, NSA/CSS Georgia
Run Date: 11/09/2005
(U//FOUO) SIDtoday is pleased to present its first "what's happening" article from Fort Gordon:
(S//SI) The end of FY 05 and beginning of FY 06 has been a particularly busy and exciting time for NSA/CSS Georgia as we continue our SIGINT support to the Global War on Terrorism in a high intensity AOR*. Many NSA-G accomplishments have been briefed at the Director's weekly Campaign Update, in Director's desk notes to DOD and Intelligence Community seniors and in feedback from our customers, especially those forces deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, we have hosted both the Director and Deputy Director of NSA, continued detailed planning on mission alignment and transformation as well as planning for our new building construction.
(S//SI) We have also successfully stood up the Alternate- NSOC (Project DECKPIN) and integrated a NSAW team into the Alt-NSOC rotation. We have begun some new missions and expanded existing ones. Below are just three operational features that aim toward the successful continuation of our vitality in the SIGINT operations arena.
(TS//SI) The NSAG S2E Iranian shop hosted the 3rd Annual Iranian Target Development conference at Fort Gordon from 4 - 6 October. This event was instrumental in providing a forum for ground-level exchange of SIGINT efforts to improve the intelligence production on an elusive target set. Over 50 external guests, including Second Party partners, and NSA/CSS Georgia analysts compared notes on the task of exploiting Iranian communications as the Iranian's utilize indigenous encryption and move into high technology methods of performing command-and-control. The outcome of this conference was a comprehensive understanding of the enterprise's SIGINT efforts and the virtual teaming necessary to continue viable prosecution of this target set.
(U//FOUO) Tangible production from NSAG's new mission growth areas has begun, most notably:

# Counternarcotics (CN) 

(S//SI) DEA* recently inserted Forward Area Support Teams into Afghanistan to conduct CN operations in conjunction with the Afghan National Interdiction Unit, a branch of the CounterNarcotics Police of Afghanistan. NSA forward-deployed elements, the NSAG team, and the S2F11 SWAN Team collaborated very closely in supporting operations in Nangarhar Province.
(S//SI) During the planning process, HUMINT from DEA and CIA, along with extensive imagery from NGA* were utilized in order to assure as comprehensive a targeting package as possible. Imagery and HUMINT targets were verified and re-verified by SIGINT right up until the DEA team's insertion into the target area. During the conduct of the raid, SIGINT elements located at NSAW, NSAG, and CFC-A (Combined Forces Command-Afghanistan) were on station to guide and provide threat warning as the operation unfolded. Personnel at NSAG monitored VHF/UHF communications from a CENTCOM Predator [unmanned aerial vehicle] brought in to support the operation, and provided gists of intercept derived from high-interest VOICESAIL handsets that were active during the raid.

(S//SI) As a result of this collaborative effort, the operation was a resounding success with
five major heroin labs and over a ton of opiates and precursor chemicals destroyed, and valuable intelligence recovered that will be utilized in keying future operations. DEA has expressed its deepest gratitude to the SIGINT community for its support and direction during this initial operation and will utilize the precedents set here as a model and standard for future operations. NSAG released their first CN serialized end-product on this event; the product recapped the drug smugglers actions prior to and during the DEA raid.

# Combating Proliferation (CP) 

(S//SI) NSA/CSS Georgia's CP mission commenced operations on 1 April 2005. Since then, this production center ( 8 personnel so far) has completed Product Phasing on the Advanced Conventional Weapons mission and is mid-way through phasing on the High Interest Cargoes and CBRN missions. As of October, CP Georgia/S2X3, with guidance and assistance from 52G and NSA Georgia's reporting staffs, has been engaged in mission transfer and follow-on target development and processing resulting in over 40 product reports with accolades received from a variety of customers. CP Georgia is attracting many talented SIGINT professionals and will quickly become a center of excellence within the Global Net-centric Cryptologic Community.
