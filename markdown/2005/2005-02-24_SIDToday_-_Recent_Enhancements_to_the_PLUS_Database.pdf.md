(U//FOUO) Recent Enhancements to the PLUS Database
FROM:
PLUS Team (S111)
Run Date: 02/24/2005
"Adding" features to PLUS...(U)
(U//FOUO) PLUS is a management information system for SIGINT Production which contains statistical information and feedback about SIGINT serialized reports produced by NSAW, the RSOCs, US Field Sites, and Second and Third Parties. In addition, it contains a database retrieval tool as well as a KLIEGLIGHT tool. PLUS receives data from the SKYCAST database.
(U//FOUO) On 10 January 2005, the PLUS database started to include a new reporting vehicle: First Instance Reporting (FIR) under "Report Kind EGRAM." (See related article .) FIR coversheet information will be retrievable via the current PLUS Interface. FIR source records will be added, once the technical details are completed. Any Feedback on FIRs can be forwarded once the report is in PLUS. FIRs will be included in any EGRAM pulls. FIR serials can be recognized as having a dash preceding the 1-up serial number, e.g. 3/3R/-0001-05.
(U//FOUO) In addition to the aforementioned FIR report type, here are some PLUS-related accomplishments from 2004 and where we are headed in 2005:

# (U//FOUO) 2004 Highlights 

- In January, NSA began an exchange of selected product source data with Canada's Communications Security Establishment (CSE) modeled on the exchange already in place with UK's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). We also began discussions with Australia's Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) and New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) on a similar exchange. These exchanges have resulted in a nearly $50 \%$ increase in additional source records per month in PLUS related to Second Party-issued reports.
- A major upgrade of the PLUS SYBASE database software was implemented on 3 May which allowed PLUS to expand the lengths of many fields.
- Also in May, PLUS version 5.5 was released, which included many bug fixes, and additions to the number of limiters and breakouts. A major feature was the ability to add additional report types.
- In June, as a result of the May release, report type SIGINT On Demand (SOD) was added with data backloaded to the beginning of January 2004.
- In November, a change to the NSRP feed process was implemented which reduced the daily load time (during which the PLUS database is unavailable to users) by two hours.
- New discussions began with various data system owners to export SKYCAST data to other databases, notably RUMCAY, SCORPIOFORE, and more recently, KSP and RAINMAN.


## (U//FOUO) 2005 Initiatives

- A new PLUS Account Request Form was made available on the PLUS Web page in January 2005.
- The SKYCAST server was relocated to Serverland on 15 Feb. This has resulted in a significantly faster system response time and thus better service.
- Upcoming enhancements to PLUS during February will include the ability to pull distros on coversheets, and access to additional fields from the PLUS Interface.
- In the fall, a new and final version of PLUS will be released. Version 5.6 will include numerous breakouts, and data choice limiters.
- A new SIGINT FEEDBACK form will be available sometime in 2005.
(U//FOUO) As you can see, PLUS is moving ahead with activities to support SID's transformational efforts. For more information on PLUS, please contact the PLUS Team on email us at DL PLUSLCS or or click on on "Go PLUS" on Netscape.
