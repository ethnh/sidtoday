(U) Introducing Semi-Annual Calls for Academic and Career Development Programs

FROM:
SID Mission Interface for Education \& Training Issues (S01)
Run Date: 08/29/2005
(U) Within the next few weeks a SID announcement will be released to the workforce soliciting nominations for various long-term career developmental opportunities. A listing of those programs is provided at the end of this article. SID senior management has made the decision to perform two calls per year for these academic developmental opportunities -- a fall call and a winter call -- instead of soliciting these various programs on an ad-hoc basis throughout the year.
(U) The benefits of implementing this semi-annual call for these programs results in a more streamlined and efficient process, reduces the volume of man-hours spent on the review and administrative process for these programs; and allows for a more pro-active involvement of SID managers in addressing career development with their subordinates while linking these developmental activities to their Individual Development Plans (IDPs).
(U) The SID announcement will provide eligibility criteria for the various programs, instructions on how to apply, and guidance on the application submission process. The SID senior management team will review nominations for these developmental programs collectively to facilitate selection of the best candidates for the most appropriate opportunity. SID personnel must ensure that their nominations are submitted in accordance with the SID internal deadline rather than Agency announced program deadlines.
(U) If you meet the eligibility criteria and have your management's support, you are highly encouraged to apply for one or more of these career developmental opportunities. Questions regarding this semi-annual process for these various training opportunities can be addressed to the Ft. Meade, ADET/Customer Service Center (POC: $\square$ sid: $\square$
