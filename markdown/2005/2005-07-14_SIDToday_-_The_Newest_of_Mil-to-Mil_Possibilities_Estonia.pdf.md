(U//FOUO) The Newest of Mil-to-Mil Possibilities: Estonia

(S//SI) There are currently Military-to-Military SIGINT relationships with 26 different countries throughout the globe. The majority of these resides in the USEUCOM Area of Responsibility and was initially focused on the Soviet Union. The USEUCOM J2** has taken a very active interest in the benefits of Mil-to-Mil SIGINT relationships and has been looking at the new NATO nations as possible partners that can be used to answer USEUCOM's Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) and Intelligence Needs (INs). There is currently a proposal at the SIGCOM level to establish a Mil-to-Mil relationship with Romania, and just recently FAD approved exploratory talks with Estonia.
(S//SI) This initiative started when the US Defense Attach√© from Estonia and the Estonian J2 visited EUCOM on separate occasions in January. They talked extensively about Estonian SIGINT capabilities and desire to work with the US military. USEUCOM and NCEUR canvassed the Service Cryptologic Elements in Europe and found the 26th Information Operations Group (Air Force) was very interested in an exchange.
(S//SI) Initial research and discussions have shown that Estonia, a new NATO nation and a member of the NATO Advisory Committee on Signals Intelligence (NACSI), is currently participating in coalition operations in Iraq with 36 soldiers on the ground. USEUCOM believes the Estonian Defense Force (EDF) is operating SIGINT sites focusing on Russian air operations in the St. Petersburg Military District and Russian ground forces in the Pskov Military District.
(S//SI) Internal to NSA, there is currently no established Estonian Country Team. The Office of Russia does not believe that the EDF has anything to offer NSA that is not already being reported within the Intelligence Community (IC); therefore, there is currently no interest from NSA in a National relationship with Estonia. Within the US IC, the EDF is currently reporting some SIGINT through the CIA Chief of Station (COS) in Tallinn. The COS has stated that exploratory talks could possibly identify new access that the EDF has not yet shared. The COS will participate in all exploratory discussions but does not see any long-term benefit in a Mil-toMil. Nonetheless, DP16 -- as advocates for USEUCOM and the other combatant commands -- will staff and advocate any request validated through the command.
(S//SI) It will be interesting to see if exploratory discussions lead to a USEUCOM request for the establishment of a Mil-to- Mil relationship. In the meantime, NSA and FAD will benefit from seeing the targets to which the Estonians have access, and how proficient they are as SIGINTers.
