(U) Mil-to-Mil Conference Addresses Coalition Operations

FROM:
FAD's Multinational/Second Party Office (DP16)
Run Date: 06/15/2005
(C) The Office of Multinational and Second Party Affairs recently hosted the second Global Military-to-Military Foreign Affairs Conference at NSAW. Over 70 SIGINT professionals representing elements of the global SIGINT enterprise -- NSAW, NSA/CSS Hawaii, Georgia, and Texas, US military commands and SCEs, GCHQ, CSE, DSD, and GCSB - met to discuss military-to-military foreign partnerships in general and coalition operations in particular.
(C) Charles Berlin, Deputy Director for Customer Relationships, provided the keynote address, describing his vision of 21st Century SIGINT and Five Impediments to SIGINT Success. He also challenged the participants to focus on the way forward towards the realization of the conference's theme, " Coalition Operations - Success Through Collaboration ." On the second day of the conference, Ambassador Hugh Montgomery, Special Assistant to the DCI for Foreign Intelligence Relationships, outlined the " Changes in the Intelligence Paradigm ."
(U//FOUO) Conference presentations outlined "what worked" and "what didn't work" in SIGINT coalition efforts supporting Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Perhaps even more important than the briefings themselves were the candid discussions that followed. Group consensus indicated the conference was definitely worthwhile and recommended it be held annually, with the possibility of rotating host locations. For briefings, minutes, and additional information on the conference, please refer to the conference website located on the Foreign Affairs Directorate homepage.
