(S) SIGINT plays major role in defeating insurgents.
(S//SI) "Tactical SIGINT is dead..." Speaking those words will get you kicked out of Northern Iraq, where SIGINT recently contributed to the killing or capture of 134 high-level insurgents and countless associates over a 90-day period. As a result of these successes, nearly all of the known leaders of the al-Zarqawi Network as we know it in Northern Iraq are either dead or detained. The capture of these senior and mid-level leaders and facilitators has dramatically weakened the enemy and significantly contributed to coalition force protection.
(S//SI) On-the-scene SIGINTers working with MNF-NW (Multi-National Force - Northwest) have contributed greatly to these successful operations. This team, CST** STRYKER in Mosul, has leveraged national level cryptologic support to more than 700 MNF-NW operations, in addition to providing more than 1200 threat tippers to support continuous combat operations throughout the area of operations.
(S//SI) They say that "necessity is the mother of invention" and this is even more true in wartime. When the first SIGINT analysts arrived in Mosul, they inherited a war-torn city filled with anti-Coalition insurgents. As insurgent tactics evolved and the commander's need for realtime SIGINT became a necessity, Soldiers developed faster and better ways of producing actionable intelligence. They developed locally created tools -- the Quadra Spectre Geolocational system, 5-Digit Comparator, a TMSI** query tool -- and solid procedures for reducing the time from identification of a target until maneuver forces go after it.
(S//SI) One tool, the Quadra Spectre, pulls chronolog data, correlates Short Message System (SMS) text messages, and most importantly provides near real-time locational data used for targeting. The time saved in analysis had a snowball effect. Greater time could be spent on correlation, finding new targets, perfecting target packages, and providing real-time threat tippers to units. The tool shortened days of painstaking analysis to mere hours, leading to a number of SIGINT successes for Task Force Freedom. SIGINTers are currently networking all of Northern Iraq's GSM tactical collection, combining efforts and tracking insurgent movement from just north of Baghdad to all the way to Rabiyah.
(S//SI) The configuration of the MNF-NW SIGINT Cell has also undergone improvements. Task Force Freedom combined analysts from NSA's Cryptologic Support Team with analysts from the Stryker Brigade, XVIII Airborne Corps, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (ACR), and 11th ACR all into one cell, then consolidated the linguists, allowing them the opportunity to release threat tippers in near real-time. MNF-NW also cultivated a relationship with agencies in their AOR** ( SCS Mosul and DIA**, for example) to fuse SIGINT products, thereby preventing duplication of effort. These steps created a combined effort capitalizing on our ability to report, analyze, target, and fuse actionable intelligence for the warfighter. MNF-NW SIGINT "Mini Intelligence Community" structure and operations is the model for the future of tactical SIGINT.
(S//SI) These new ways of operating, coupled with a Command that understands SIGINT and has capitalized on it, has reinvigorated the old adage of "intelligence drives operations." TFF Commander and the Stryker BDE Commander believe wholeheartedly in Signals Intelligence.
(S//SI) SID's gamble with imbedding Cryptologic Support Teams with tactical units has paid huge dividends. Although they couldn't save every Soldier, the CST's added the horsepower tactical units needed to bridge the gap between national and tactical SIGINT... And
forward-deployed analysts are not alone in the fight, thanks to great support from CSG** Baghdad, CENTCOM, NSA/CSS Georgia and NSA HQ!
