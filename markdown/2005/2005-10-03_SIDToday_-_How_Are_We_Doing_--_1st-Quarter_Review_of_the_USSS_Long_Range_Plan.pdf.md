Perhaps you're wondering how SID is making progress towards achieving its Long Range Plan? Or maybe you wonder how the work you're doing fits into the big plan? Well, wonder no more! SID has completed its 1st-Quarter Long Range Plan Review, providing a forum to track performance and demonstrate greater accountability for results.
(U//FOUO) You can find the 1st-Quarter Review at the S01X SIGINT Planning, Programming and Performance home page, by clicking on Long Range Plans - 1st-OTR Review. (Note for viewing the briefing: If you double-click on each goal, it will expand to full size. ) The review contains information on the key activities briefed at a leadership session held September 6, 2005.
