(S//SI) Quick Deployment Keeps CT Collection Flowing
FROM: SIGINT Communications
and General Production Services (S31554)
Run Date: 08/01/2005
(U) Needed systems up and running within 40 days.
(TS//SI//REL) In previous SID today articles* we've described how SIGINT can be used to locate terrorists who use Internet cafes in Iraq. What happens when some of those Internet caf√© terminals are migrated to a new communications hub, causing the SIGINT System to lose its collection? Such a situation happened in September, 2004 when DVB-S** Directway terminals in Iraq switched to a new hub in the United Arab Emirates. Faced with the loss of potentially crucial intelligence, the Counterterrorism (CT) Product Line issued an urgent requirement to reestablish the collection.
(TS//SI//REL) Representatives from Data Acquisition (S3), SCS , and SIGDEV immediately began to work on the problem. They determined that an SCS site in Ankara could access the signals, but there was a problem: the site wasn't set up to collect and process DVB-S. The race was on to deploy the needed capabilities as quickly as possible.
(TS//SI//REL) The deployment faced several challenges, including:

- limited power and space in Ankara,
- limited bandwidth to the site,
- dataflow issues,
- the need to upgrade software to handle HPEP data compression, and
- the need for extensive work to integrate and test the deployed systems.
(TS//SI//REL) Despite these hurdles, a functioning system was up and running within a short 40 days. The payoff was also swift: a CT analyst reported that this collection had prompted a successful raid in Kirkuk, netting "multiple bad guys" and a weapons cache. With luck, other tipoffs based on this collection will follow in the future. Congratulations to all who worked together to make this success a reality!
