- (U) What is KRYPTOS?
(U) The KRYPTOS Society was established in 1981 to promote interest in cryptanalysis, to provide a focal point for the fields of common interest to cryptanalysts of the National Security Agency, and to promote excellence in the cryptologic community. It has since expanded with chapters at GCHQ, CSE and DSD, which has members from GCSB as well. Although NSA's KRYPTOS has an elected council of 8 members from the community, it cannot function without volunteers from among the rest of the approximately 250 members.
- (U) What does KRYPTOS do?
(U) First, KRYPTOS sponsors several technical talks throughout the year. These talks are given by members of the wider cryptanalysis community and are hopefully of interest to cryptanalysts, and are usually open to all cleared employees.
(U) In addition, KRYPTOS sponsors several annual activities to recognize cryptanalytic excellence. The Cryptanalytic Literature Competition is for papers written on topics clearly relating to cryptanalysis and there is also a Technical Talk (on video) competition which seeks to recognize the best technical presentation on cryptanalysis or one of its related disciplines. International panels of judges decide what papers and talks are awarded (cash prizes). The Norman Roberts Award, also juried by an international board, is sponsored by the Cheltenham Chapter to recognize outstanding contributions by a junior analyst; finally there is the Peter Jenks Community Service Award for NSA KRYPTOS members only. In addition, KRYPTOS acts as a cosponsor with the Cryptanalysis Skill Community for the prestigious Gold Bug award.
(U) Starting the fall of 2005, there will be a "Cryptanalyst of the Quarter" where a KRYPTOS member can nominate anyone for a significant, but perhaps unheralded, cryptanalysis achievement in the previous 6 months. The recipient will be awarded a gold coffee mug with the KRYPTOS logo.
(U) KRYPTOS sponsors an annual luncheon/banquet where the annual prizes are awarded and Distinguished Members from among the retired cryptanalysts are honored (based on nominations from the cryptanalysis community). In addition, we have sponsored a strictly social event for the past several years: a CryptoMathematics Institute/KRYPTOS family night at a Bowie Baysox baseball game.
