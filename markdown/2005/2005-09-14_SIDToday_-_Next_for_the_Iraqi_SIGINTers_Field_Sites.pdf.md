(S//SI) Next for the Iraqi SIGINTers: Field Sites
FROM:
FAD/QRC - Partner Integration (DP312)
Run Date: 09/14/2005
(S//SI) With the help of NSA, Iraqi SIGINTers are branching out beyond Baghdad.
(S//SI) Phase I of Project POOLLID consisted of rebuilding the capabilities of the Iraqi SIGINT Element's (ISE) Headquarters as a legitimate intelligence organization. The Foreign Affairs Directorate's (FAD's) efforts to complete Phase I have been very successful, and we are now at a point at which Phase II, which consists of expanding the ISE to incorporate field sites that are not in the immediate Baghdad area, can begin.
(S//SI) FAD team members stationed in Iraq are conducting site surveys to evaluate each prospective field site. The team members are ensuring that the sites have good signals coverage, enough personnel for staffing, and most importantly, high security. Phase II has been in the planning stages for quite some time, but the security issues in Iraq have held up any forward motion on the project. Despite what it looks like from the constant media coverage of suicide bombers blowing up sites around Iraq, the country is slowly becoming safer, so FAD was able to begin Phase II.
(S//SI) Phase II will start out small and gradually increase in both size and effort. The first few field sites will use basic AOR and WINRADIO single channel receivers. Once the Iraqis prove that the sites are secure and worthwhile, FAD will begin to install better SIGINT equipment to improve each site's capabilities.
(S//SI) Even though Phase II has begun, Phase I has not ended. A team consisting of FAD, ETC, and ONEROOF members is scheduled to install new equipment into the ISE's Headquarters in August. Because of the increasing volume of High Powered Cordless Phone calls that the ISE has been collecting, more ONEROOF and DRT (Digital Receiver Technology) systems are needed. In the end, we are confident that the ISE can continue to make a positive difference as Iraq's democratic processes take hold.
