(S) On 11 February, Gary Grantham, Principal Director for Foreign Affairs, briefed the National SIGINT Committee on NSA's Foreign Affairs Program. Gary gave the members of the Committee a "glimpse of the future," focusing on some upcoming initiatives with our foreign partners. Gary talked about foreign partners in general, pointing out that NSA foreign relationships don't just benefit NSA/CSS, but the US Defense and Intelligence Communities as well. The contributions of our partners were also highlighted, from support to our efforts against global terrorism, weapons proliferation, and regional conflicts, to information sharing for strategic warning, treaty monitoring, and technology transfer.
(TS//SI) Future happenings:

- Gary mentioned that the Foreign Affairs Directorate was already preparing for the 2006 Winter Olympics that will be held in Turin, Italy. The support given to the Greeks for the 2004 Summer Olympics provides a successful model to be shared with the Italians.
- The multinational collaboration in the Pacific (also known as SIGINT Seniors Pacific) is another effort in which FAD has been fully engaged, working closely with the SIGINT Directorate, the Counterterrorism Product Line, and NSA/CSS field representatives. April will see the first meeting of the new Pacific multinational forum for SIGINT collaboration; the intent is to begin the trust-building process, establish a common understanding of the purposes of the group, discuss a proposed organizational construct and concept of operations, and establish an Executive Board.
- Gary touched on the NSA relationships with Ethiopia and Pakistan, stressing that both will continue to be key in our successes in the global war on terrorism.
- Gary also discussed FAD's previous and future work with the Iraqis and Afghans. While neither relationship is a formally established NSA partnership, at the direction of the Director of Central Intelligence, FAD has moved aggressively to help these countries establish and enhance their SIGINT capabilities. Both relationships come with risks, but the overall benefit to US objectives in the region outweighs the risks.
(U//FOUO) Gary's "glimpse of the future" brief was well received by the SIGINT Committee members. The National SIGINT Committee is located in Washington, on L Street NW. The permanent members are from the Intelligence Community, specifically State, Treasury, Energy, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, CIA, DIA, FBI, NRO, Coast Guard, NGA, DHS, and NSA. The National SIGINT Committee assists the DCI and DIRNSA on a wide range of SIGINT matters. The Committee provides an independent forum for those with SIGINT equities to meet and exchange information, to discuss policy and other issues, to build consensus, and to provide well-reasoned recommendations to the DIRNSA and the DCI.
