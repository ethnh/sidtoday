(U//FOUO) Thanks and Congratulations to
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 09/07/2005
(U//FOUO) I want to take this opportunity to wish $\square$ the very best in his new assignment as Deputy, Assistant Deputy Director for National Intelligence, Technical Means (ADDNI/TM). Fortunately for us, will remain an NSA'er as he develops this new position.
(U) We are grateful to $\square$ for his leadership of the Data Acquisition Directorate during a time which has seen much change and broadening of responsibilities for all of the Deputy Directorates. He has enabled the transformation of DA in the way the collection assets around the world are governed and the way we develop and deploy our special purpose systems.
(U//FOUO) Formerly the Assistant Deputy Director for Data Acquisition, Jim Cusick has assumed the job as Deputy Director for Data Acquisition. This allows a seamless transition of leadership and continuity of direction. Jim will be supported by Rick Ledgett who is the new ADD/DA. Rick is returning from Hawaii where he was the NSA/CSS Representative Pacific Command (NCPAC).
(U) Please join me in congratulating $\square$ and Jim on their new endeavors and in welcoming Rick back to NSA/CSS Maryland.
