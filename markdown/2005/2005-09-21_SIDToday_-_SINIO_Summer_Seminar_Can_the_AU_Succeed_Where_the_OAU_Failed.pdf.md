"Can the AU (African Union) Succeed Where the OAU (Organization of African Unity) Failed?

Course Overview:
U//FOUO) The African Union (AU) replaced the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in July 2002. What led to this change? What is different about the AU? The AU is clearly pursuing a much more active role in the resolution of crises in Africa. This seminar will discuss the current AU peacekeeping mission in Darfur, Sudan, as well as ambitious AU proposals for intervention elsewhere on the continent. The promise of the AU and the challenges it faces as it strives to be an effective institution able to shape Africa's future will also be addressed.
