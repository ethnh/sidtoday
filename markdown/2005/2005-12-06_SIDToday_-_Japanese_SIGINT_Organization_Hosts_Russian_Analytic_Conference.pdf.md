FROM:
NSA/CSS Japan Representative Tokyo (NCJRT) - F41
Run Date: 12/06/2005
(TS//SI) The Japanese SIGINT organization (DFS) hosted the Russian Analytic Conference, which was the first broad analytic meeting in more than five years. The Conference included topics that were discussed at the new CAT-III level (Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces), in addition to Russian Navy, Air, and Ground Forces. NSA relies heavily on DFS to provide data and analysis of Far East targets that it does not have the resources and/or access to cover.
(TS//SI) DFS analysts demonstrated their capabilities in more accurately tracking and ID'ing Russian nuclear submarines and in tracking movements of Air and Ground Forces in the Far East. NSA analysts invited DFS to come to NSA HQ for next year's conference.
(S//SI) Mr. $\square$ Analytic Technical Director for HF/MILCOMSAT, Russia Product Center, NSA and $\square$ Strategic Rocket Forces Analyst at DFS enjoy a toast together
