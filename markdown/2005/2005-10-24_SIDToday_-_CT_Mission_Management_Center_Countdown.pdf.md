(U//FOUO) CT Mission Management Center Countdown
FROM:
Chief of Staff, CT Mission Management Center (STC)
Run Date: 10/24/2005
(C) The official stand-up of the Counterterrorism Mission Management Center (CT MMC) is quickly approaching! Work on the physical space where the Center will be housed - 3E132, directly adjacent to NSOC - is proceeding apace, with completion expected sometime around Thanksgiving. In addition, CT MMC Operations Center officers are nearing the end of their training. They will be launching initial CT MMC 24/7 operations on 5 November at 0600 Local in temporary spaces within NSOC. As of the 5th, the CT Product Line's Counterterrorism Watch Officer and NSOC's Terrorism Desk functions will stand down. The services currently provided by the individuals in these positions, however, will be immediately transitioned to the CT MMC.
(C) Finally, the organizational structure underpinning the Associate Deputy Directorate for the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) was officially approved on 18 September and the following organizational designators are now effective:

- ST - Associate Deputy Director for the GWOT (Mr. Lonny Anderson)
- STC - CT Mission Management Center (Mr. Ron Carback, Director, Ms. Julia PallozziRuhm, Deputy Director, and Chief of Staff)
