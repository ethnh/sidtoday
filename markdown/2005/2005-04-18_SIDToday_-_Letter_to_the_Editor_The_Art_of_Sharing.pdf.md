(U) We received a letter on the recent article The Art of Sharing: Insight and Continuity :

## From: CPT

Comment: (U//FOUO) The issue of continuity is one that has kept with me throughout my 20 years in the military, and having worked under BG Defreitas in the USFK C/J2 in Korea, and to hear his thoughts here in the Iraq Theater of Operations is to hear an echo of my own concerns. We as a military (and I use that to cover the ancillary support organizations), do a poor job of capturing the not just the lessons learned (which has become overused), but the processes learned. Processes, whether they be communication, architecture, connectivity, points of contact, are the first things to drop when the "Relief in Place" drives out of the Forward Operating Base. All of those processes lead to the way we THINK about the problem, which leads to the sort of insight mentioned in the article. The military juggernaut (Army), is riding a tsunami of information overload, and we have not built the proper life preserver to wrap our arms around it.
