Course Overview:
(U//FOUO) During the Cold War, the U.S. CI community had the luxury of playing defense. Sometimes it failed, as a number of spies evaded detection for many years. These spies inflicted serious damage on U.S. National Security. Today, the U.S. is at war and playing defense is no longer an acceptable tactic.
(S//SI) To address the war on terror and the nexus between CI and CT, the National CI strategy has adopted a more offensive posture. CI analysts have long-studied information on enemy security services to deny and disrupt their collection efforts and also to penetrate their agencies. Terrorist tactics rely on surprise, clandestine operations, and compartmentation. The tactics they use provide the nexus between CI and CT. LTG Odom (USA, Ret) noted that "CI is intelligence about the enemy's intelligence...because terrorists have much in common with spies, operating clandestinely, CI must also include counterterrorism intelligence, both domestically and abroad." This seminar, will examine the overlap in tactics and tradecraft between CI and CT.
