(U) Help Fight the Global War on Terrorism

FROM: Ron Carback
Director, Counterterrorism Mission Management Center
Run Date: 07/05/2005
(U//FOUO) Here's your chance to get in on the ground floor of the new Counterterrorism Mission Management Center! Plan to attend the CT MMC Job Fair on Thursday, 7 July from 11001300 in room 2B3104. If you're interested in the challenges that the CT MMC has to offer, come see us.
(U//FOUO) The CT MMC is charged with providing global situational awareness of CT SIGINT activities to the Enterprise, synchronizing CT SIGINT operations around the globe and taking full advantage of time-critical CT SIGINT opportunities. We have key assignments that must be filled as soon as possible: Senior Operations Leaders, Operations Officers, Intelligence Officers, and Executive Officers. We're building a 24/7 operation that will commence operations in the fall in a state-of-the-art facility immediately adjacent to NSOC, and we're ready to start training.
(U//FOUO) As MG Quirk has said, "We're seeking talented, experienced, dedicated, and capable men and women from a wide variety of backgrounds to fill these challenging positions and we will expect much from those who are selected. Together -- and in conjunction with all the other key pieces of the CT puzzle -- they will orchestrate the SIGINT effort against terrorism around the world and around the clock." (See full message .)
(U) If you're up to the challenge, we want to talk with you!
