(U) This Could Be the Start of a Beautiful Friendship....

(S//SI) No, we're not on the movie set for "Casablanca," but this line is apropos for NSA's budding SIGINT relationship with the Czech Republic. Karel Randak, the Director General of the Czech External Intelligence Service (UZSI), and his senior leadership team recently concluded their initial visit to NSA and during the final session of this historic meeting, the visitors commented, "The agenda was perfect," this visit was "really exceptional," we have "never seen such openness," "everyone was very well prepared and very professional.... The presentations were brilliant!" We expect formal approval for this relationship from the Director of National Intelligence within the near future, and these meetings will have laid the foundation for collaboration with our newest Third Party partner.
(S//SI) Bill Black, the Acting DIRNSA, and Gary Grantham, Principal Director for Foreign Affairs, set the tone for this visit by charging NSA associates to openly engage the Czechs in frank discussions focused on areas of potential cooperation. Their main points to our foreign visitors were that they want UZSI to benefit from NSA's capabilities, that UZSI should not suffer through mistakes that NSA has already made, and that we can work together in areas of common interest. In his opening remarks to the Czechs, Gary stressed, "The more effective we can make you, the more we will get out of the relationship." The agenda included:

- conversations with five different Product Lines;
- a tour of NSOC;
- technical discussions concerning HF modernization, FORNSAT collection and processing, SIGINT development, machine translation and OCR issues; and
- talks about establishing a signal analysis relationship and cryptologic training.
(S//SI) For their part, the Czechs also came prepared. They gave NSA three Analyst Notebook files that graphically display the communications of BELTEKHEXPORT, a Belorussian company involved in weapons proliferation, and its contacts within the Syrian and UAE military establishments. Another file contained telephone numbers for the Russian arms dealer ROSOBORONEXPORT in Russia, Syria, UAE, Viet Nam, and India. Information on the Russian SBERBANK and BANKIR VSAT banking networks was turned over to NSA, as were many pages of SIGINT information concerning Russian counterintelligence targets, general satellite communications and specific Russian satellite communications. NSA and UZSI will continue an existing partnership on Russian counterintelligence issues, but we will also identify additional areas for collaboration based on information exchanged during these meetings.
(S//SI) Though the Czechs were at NSA for only two days and the agenda was packed, the visit was not all work. A/DIR hosted a dinner at McCormick and Schmick's Seafood Restaurant in Baltimore's Inner Harbor and the visitors enjoyed a brief stroll around the harbor. MG Quirk and Fran Fleisch, FAD's Assistant Director for SIGINT Operations, hosted lunches at which the visitors got to know some NSA associates on a more personal level. On their final evening in town, the Czech Embassy hosted a buffet dinner in Rockville, MD, at the home of Miroslav Toman, who is the UZSI representative working at the Czech Embassy in Washington. Our ability to jointly produce valuable SIGINT while enjoying each other's company and learning about our cultural differences may indeed make this the start of a beautiful friendship.
