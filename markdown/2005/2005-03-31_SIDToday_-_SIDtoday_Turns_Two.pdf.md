Run Date: 03/31/2005
(U//FOUO) Hard as it may be for us to believe, today is the second anniversary of the SID today webpage. We'll use this occasion to remind (or inform) our readers of a few things:

1. Anyone can submit an article. Don't wait for us or your management to invite you to submit an article -- if you have a story to tell that would be of interest to the SID work force, take the initiative and let us know your idea. On the right-hand side of the SID today page you will find the "Submit an Item" box.
2. If you have some information or observations to add to an article, send a Letter to the Editor. We often post these letters as follow-up articles for everyone's benefit.
3. Send us feedback at any time. We want to know what you think of the articles presented and the page in general. Send us your ideas for future content.
4. On a related note, it's time to award the second annual SIDney Award for the most admired article. We'll review the positive feedback we received to all of the articles (March 31, 2004 - March 31, 2005), tally them up, and proclaim a winner. It's not too late to send in feedback -- if there was an article that you thought was particularly good, but you never sent in feedback on it, do so now! You can call up the article in our SID today archives and use the feedback option at the bottom of the text. We'll award the prestigious SIDney Award to the winning author in the coming weeks.
(U) Thanks for reading and contributing to SID today!
