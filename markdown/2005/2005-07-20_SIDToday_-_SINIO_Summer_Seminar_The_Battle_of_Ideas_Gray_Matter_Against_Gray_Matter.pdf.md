Course Overview:
(S) The mind is always the ultimate and final target in war. For those adversarial entities with meager military resources, embarking on global influence campaigns to win converts is a growing weapon of choice. Aiding this campaign to alter public consciousness is the ease, speed, and low cost of global electronic media. To counter, the key is to uncover these adversarial information strategies that impact national level interests and security at the strategic and tactical level. Attention will be given to understanding the information needs of the customer and the role SIGINT can play in this battle of ideas/gray matter against gray matter.
(U//FOUO) Please consult the SINIO Website ("go sinio") for information on future events in this series.
