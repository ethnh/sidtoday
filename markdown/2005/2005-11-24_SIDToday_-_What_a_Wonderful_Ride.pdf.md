(U) What a Wonderful Ride!

FROM: Charlie Meals
SIGINT Deputy Director
Run Date: 11/24/2005
(U) This is without a doubt the toughest message I have ever released-- sometimes the rumor mill is actually right and this is one of those times. After much consideration and discussion (along with a fair amount of procrastination), I have decided it is time to step aside and retire, effective 3 January 2006. This has been a difficult decision for me and my family, especially since I still very much enjoy being part of this extraordinary agency and its critical contributions to national security.
(U) This wonderful ride began nearly 40 years ago and has provided me with remarkable opportunities and experiences. Best of all, however, I have had the chance to work with the nation's "best and brightest." While it has been said many times before, it remains absolutely true -- ".. in the end it is indeed the wonderful people here that make it so worthwhile!" For the past three years, I have had the good fortune and privilege to serve with the SID leadership team. While most of you know all too well that we have more than our share of challenges and tough days, I sometimes feel guilty for having so much fun, even when the days begin at o'dark thirty and end all-too-late at night. Notwithstanding, I truly consider it an honor and a privilege to have worked with you over these many years. Thank you so very much for all of your support and most of all for your untiring and superlative efforts-- I am very proud of all of you.

NOTE from SIGINT Communications: Planning for farewell activities in Charlie's honor is still in the works. Watch SIDtoday for details.
