(U//FOUO) DNI Requirement: Employees to Create or Update a Profile of Their Skills

FROM:
Dancehall Team Lead (S01)
Run Date: 10/03/2005
(U//FOUO) A recent article acquainted you with the DANCEHALL Mission Readiness Database. Beginning today, the following personnel will be called upon to update their skills profile in the DANCEHALL/CVA database:

- All S2 (Analysis and Production) employees -- civilian, military and reserve
- Employees at the Global Cryptologic Centers (former RSOCs)
- The S01 (SID/Integrated Planning) staff
- SID/Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)

Eventually all of the SID organizations will be populating the database so that 1) SID has a better picture of the overall skills of its workforce and 2) NSA's required input to the ARC (Analytic Resources Catalog) is more complete.

# (U) What is the ARC? 

(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS, like every member of the Intelligence Community (IC), is required to provide data on a semiannual basis to the Analytic Resources Catalog. The ARC was created in 2003 to inform the IC's most senior intelligence officials about analytic expertise in the Community. The ARC resides in the office of the Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis (DDNI/A).
(U//FOUO) The ARC's centralized repository contains data on analysts' current assignments and expertise, professional histories and experiences, and personal data -- such as education -- that pertain to expertise. The ARC provides senior officials the capability to:

- Identify specific analytic expertise across the IC
- Know how many analysts are covering various targets
- Leverage recruitment efforts
- Support the DCI's annual response to the National Security Council on IC responsiveness to the intelligence priority process (i.e. the NSPD-26/NIPF)
- Respond to Congressional requests for information on analytic resources.


## (U) How Will This Call-for-Data Work?

(U//FOUO) The call to enter or update skills data will be conducted by the Dancehall Team. Although DANCEHALL also provides a means for applying for a vacant position, please remember that the process of entering or updating your personal profile in Dancehall/CVA is different from the process of volunteering for a new placement. Individuals who would like to be considered for a specific position should follow the additional procedures described in DANCEHALL.
(U//FOUO) Please be assured that you will not be subjected to an involuntary directed assignment solely on the basis of the skills information provided. Furthermore, we have the assurance of the DNI/Analysis that the ARC will not be used to locate mission experts within the individual IC-member agencies for involuntary deployment to another mission or organization.
(U//FOUO) The Dancehall team will notify individual Product Lines when each is to begin participating in the data-call. At that time, all members of the product line will be provided with working aids and contact information for the Dancehall Team, should additional assistance be required. The amount of time required varies depending on the breadth of target expertise, but it is estimated that an average of 30 minutes of mission time per person is required to complete a new professional skills entry; and about 5-10 minutes to review and update an existing profile. The accuracy, integrity, and thoroughness of your responses are
essential to conveying an appropriate picture of mission health within NSA and the analytic capabilities of the IC. The data call must be completed by $\mathbf{1 0 0 \%}$ of the workforce in the organizations listed at the beginning of this article.
(U//FOUO) DANCEHALL continues to evolve and the Dancehall Team is committed to making the tool even easier and more user-friendly. Analysts in S2 and the Cryptologic Centers have already offered many helpful suggestions to improve the tool. We encourage you to keep them coming. Please send us feedback on the ease of use of the Dancehall/CVA application via the dl dancehallteam (or 00000000000000 nsa) alias.
(U//FOUO) The Dancehall Team and DNI ARC Program Managers thank you in advance for your participation and cooperation. They can be reached at 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
