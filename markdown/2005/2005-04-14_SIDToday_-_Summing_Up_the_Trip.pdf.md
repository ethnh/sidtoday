(U) Summing Up the Trip

Reflections on the recent SID leadership tdy (U)
(U//FOUO) You've had several opportunities over the past two weeks to read about the experiences and education of the SID traveling team, led by MG Quirk, as we moved through Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Here are few observations that help me put this all in context.
(S//SI) First, the action "out there" is the best example of true transformation that I have seen. The customer is driving action, and every "INT" is integrating into the joint civilian/military effort in a remarkably smooth and powerful way. SIGINT is a prominent player, not just behind the scenes (and behind compartments) but visibly, in nearly every specific operation, and in the way people throughout the theater think about how to do their job. It is an incredibly compelling implementation of "Hunt, not Gather", with everyone contributing information to inform targeting. Our last stop, at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, was a fine example of the style: everyone in one room, focused only on the goal, sharing information and issues, working as one team. No one was "transforming" because it would play well back home with their bosses: they were acting this way because it works.
(S//SI) Second, what makes this work is our people, of all kinds, here and overseas. You can't help but admire and thank the folks who are stepping far out of their comfort zone to operate in a complex, intense, dangerous environment far from family. We met many people out there from Fort Meade, who had seldom been outside of Maryland before, and they were as excited and productive as they could be. We also found many who were on their third and fourth tours, especially from organizations like OTRaS and F6, which have been doing "expeditionary SIGINT" naturally, in accordance with their mission. We found these folks everywhere we went, making a huge difference in every aspect of the war they touched. Last, but not least, we saw deep connections back home, to all of you who create the tools, translate, analyze information, etc. The technical people working Iraqi GSM at Fort Meade, the language analysts here and at NSA/CSS Georgia, and many others around the enterprise were in the fight just as much as those wearing firearms.
(U//FOUO) Last, there is the "why" of all this. We know that we are fighting to remove terrorist threats to our nation, our allies, and peace-loving nations around the world. We saw a sight that, for me, portrays this in a positive, concrete way. We were driving in armored cars through the streets of Kabul. It's a fascinating place, but terribly poor, and the signs of past wars are everywhere. As we turned the corner, we drove by a group of school children, boys and girls, skipping home from school (no one skips TO school!). They had not a care in the world at that moment. To me,
