# (U) New USSID System On-Line 

FROM: the USSID Re-engineering Team (S02L1)

Run Date: 07/20/2005
(U//FOUO) Have you consulted a United States Signals Intelligence Directive (USSID) recently and found the USSID number has changed? The USSID Re-Engineering team in SIGINT Policy rolled out a new system for organizing on-line USSIDs on 11 July 2005. This roll-out was the culmination of almost two years of work to transform the USSID system into a library of information that represents the United States SIGINT System (USSS) of today and provides room to grow for the USSS of tomorrow.
(U//FOUO) The system is based on a top-level structure that places USSIDs into seven major groupings:

- SIGINT Fundamental Policy,
- Customer Relationships,
- Analysis and Production,
- Data Acquisition,
- SIGINT Development,
- SIGINT Generic, and
- the SIGINT Enterprise.

Each major grouping is categorized into sub-groupings with individual USSIDs of similar topics grouped together. New alphanumeric designators have been applied to the USSIDs to reflect these groupings and sub-groupings. See
for additional information.
(U//FOUO) The renumbering and regrouping of the old USSID system is the first phase of the USSID Re-engineering effort. In the next 12 months, USSIDs will be published on topics where no policy existed before. Some current USSIDs will also be broken up into smaller pieces and other current USSIDs consolidated with others to enable users to find information much more easily. SIGINT Policy will continue to work with Subject Matter Experts in the SIGINT Enterprise to improve the accuracy of the information.
(U//FOUO) Finally, those users who access the USSIDs on INTELINK will find a more complete USSID library. Today, only a relatively limited subset of the current USSID inventory resides on INTELINK, but an expanded INTELINK USSID library will be made available in coming weeks. With this new library, access control via passwords will be instituted to protect USSIDs, which can divulge a lot of critical information on SIGINT production processes and procedures.
(U//FOUO) The USSID Re-engineering Team continues to ensure that USSIDs are a useful source of information for governing our distributed net-centric SIGINT architecture into the 21st century.
