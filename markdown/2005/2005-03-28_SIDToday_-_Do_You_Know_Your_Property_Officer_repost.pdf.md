Keeping track of SID property (U)
(U//FOUO) Property Accountability is an issue that most people still think the Logistics/LL2 organization handles. Although LL2 oversees Property Accountability for the Agency, the physical act of accounting for property is the responsibility of each Directorate. That demands that managers, Property Officers (POs) and individuals all communicate in order for the Directorate to reach and maintain its goal of 100\% accountability annually for all of its Agency-Owned Accountable Property (AOAP). These are items under government responsibility, not items under the responsibility of Eagle Alliance.
(U//FOUO) Do you know who your organization's PO is? Each person should. If you do not, please take a few minutes to review the listing of SID Property Officers (click on the link to your organization). This link is updated regularly.
(U//FOUO) If you have any questions regarding property, or anytime you are aware of equipment being installed/deinstalled/moved, etc. please take a few minutes and drop your PO an email with the details so they can ensure the correct paperwork is being completed and the property database is being updated. Better to communicate and be safe than to have to locate missing equipment during the annual inventory.
(U//FOUO) For additional information, you can visit the SID Property webpage -- type: "go sid property" in your browser.
(U//FOUO) If you have any questions or problems with Eagle Alliance equipment, you must contact Eagle. Please put in a ticket to $\square$ or type: "go itsc" on the web. Alternatively, you can contact the Groundbreaker Project Management Office (GB PMO) -- type "go groundbreaker".
