(U//FOUO) In an October SID today article, we introduced you to the concept of Governance, which is changing the way that the USSS is doing business. We told you that Governance training was already underway and that it was critical to getting the word out. But, we kept you in suspense ... what does that training entail?
(U//FOUO) Because it is imperative that everyone in the USSS (United States SIGINT System) understand Governance and his or her role in it, senior leadership is ensuring that everyone has access to Governance-related information, which can take various forms -- training within your organization; videos; and documents and briefing slides.
(U) Training :
(U//FOUO) In early October, SIGINT Director MG Quirk met with his Deputy Directors and their subordinates concerning Governance. He thus began the process of "chain training." Simply, chain training is the practice whereby a manager trains personnel two rungs down; that level then trains two levels down, and so on, until everyone has been trained. Chain training is to be completed by 1 December.
(U//FOUO) In line with chain training, MG Quirk is holding four Governance sessions with randomly selected junior personnel. These sessions will allow MG Quirk to personally inform a sector of the workforce on the importance and benefits of the Governance framework. All four sessions will be broadcast via videoteleconference (VTC) to the entire USSS.
(U) Videos :
(U//FOUO) In addition, several videos are currently being produced that will deliver the theory and processes of Governance to your desktop. The first video is nearing completion and will be streamed so that everyone can view it. Once the video is ready for prime time, you will receive a "sid_all" message letting you know how to access the video.

## (U) Slides and Documentation :

(U//FOUO) If you are itching for more information on Governance, there is a slew of it on the SID homepage. Just look under the "Gearing up for Governance" section; you will find briefing slides with supporting notes and documentation (some of it still in draft format).
(U//FOUO) Remember, the SIGINT OPS Staff (S020) and the Communications Staff (S02C) are here to help answer any questions that you may have on Governance training.
