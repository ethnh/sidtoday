# (U) Leadership of CT-MMC Named 

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA Signals Intelligence Director Run Date: 05/24/2005
(C) I have approved the selection of the following individuals to serve in the senior management positions of the CT-MMC (Counterterrorism Mission Management Center). These individuals have already contributed significantly in the GWOT, and bring an extensive amount of knowledge, expertise, and experience to the center. In the near term they will focus on staffing the center, and formalizing relationships between the CT-MMC and every "player" in the global SIGINT system. I know the SID workforce will provide their full cooperation and support to the CT-MMC in the prosecution of the Global War on Terrorism.
