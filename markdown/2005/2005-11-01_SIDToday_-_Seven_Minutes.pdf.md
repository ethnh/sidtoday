# (U) Seven Minutes 

FROM: Wayne Murphy
SID Keyworker for the CFC
Run Date: 11/01/2005

As the SID Keyworker for the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) I've received a number of contacts from personnel with questions about the CFC. Last week I got an e-mail from an employee asking what they needed to do in order to make a contribution. I spend about 2 minutes writing back to thank them for their interest, and explained all the giving options. They wrote back within 7 minutes of getting my e-mail to say they had just completed making their donation. Seven minutes!

I don't know whom he chose to donate to or how much he chose to give, but I know that in that 7 minutes his actions may have changed the life of a stranger or strangers who will anonymously benefit from the fruits of his generosity. OK, that may be a little melodramatic, but look at the tiny acts of kindness that have made such a difference in places like the Gulf Coast, in the earthquake wracked parts of South Asia or in the desperately impoverished parts of Africa. How much time or money is a meal, a blanket, a bandage, a teddy bear for a child, or a warm bed worth? Couldn't any of those simple acts change a life?

Most of us lead very busy lives and have a great many demands placed on us. People who work the vital mission of the Signals Intelligence Directorate are especially representative of placing others before self in devoted service to their country. Many of you give generously and prefer to give anonymously outside of work to causes that matter to you and those you love. I'm asking if you won't extend yourself a bit more and consider how you might best spend 7 minutes of your day today.

Take the time you might spend in a Starbuck's line this week and the money you might spend on a week's worth of their coffee and change the life of a stranger. You give $100 \%$ to mission every day, wouldn't it be great if the SID CFC could reflect 100\% participation in the charitable cause of others. Thank you for considering this request.
