(U) The day after the attacks of September 11, 2001, Sir Francis Richards, then Director of GCHQ, sent the following note to DIRNSA:

Mike - There is nothing I can say that does justice to the horror of yesterday's events, or to the evil that devised them. All our thoughts and prayers are with you and the people of America. You know that whatever we have is at your disposal.

God bless
Francis
