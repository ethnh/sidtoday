(U) US, Czech and Japanese -- All at the Same Table

FROM:
FAD's Central/Eastern Europe Office (DP13)
Run Date: 11/22/2005
(S//SI) For the third time in six months, NSA hosted visitors from the Czech Republic. This was billed as a "technical visit" with in-depth analytic discussions between the Czech External Intelligence Service (UZSI) and the Counterintelligence and HUMINT Support Product Line. We focused on the analysis of cluster operational messages and exploitation of Russian communications . However, we also discussed less target specific issues that can benefit many more target offices within SID.
(S//SI) Those topics included establishing direct, secure communications between UZSI and NSA, exchange of FORNSAT information and the possible deployment of our Third Party releasable FORNSAT Environmental Knowledgebase to the Czech Republic, and deployment of software to process FORNSAT signals and deployment of NSA's HF/DF capability (CROSSHAIR) to the Czech Republic. During these meetings, UZSI also gave NSA a Czech-developed program for spotting Russian words in voice communications. John Kovarik, the NSA/CSS Senior Language Technology Authority, and the Russia SIGDEV Division will develop an evaluation program for this software and assess its value to NSA.
(S//SI) Oh, where do the Japanese fit in? . Chief of FAD's Office for Central and Eastern Europe, hosted a dinner at Nichi Bei Kai, a Japanese restaurant in Columbia where the food is prepared on a grill that is part of your dinner table. The food was sliced, diced and tossed around with lots of flame and fanfare by a Japanese cook! Though we didn't discuss SIGINT at that table, the three nationalities were all present. When the waiter asked us if we wanted the check, I said we already had two at the table.
(U) Enjoying the show at Nichi Bei Kai

(S//SI) Addendum : Late in the afternoon on 14 October 2005, FAD learned that Ambassador Negroponte approved the establishment of the SIGINT relationship between NSA and UZSI. UZSI is now an official Third Party partner!
