(U) This article you are reading happens to be SID today 's 1000th. On behalf of the readership, we'd like to thank all who have contributed their stories and passed on their knowledge and thoughts for the benefit of the general workforce. Most of the feedback we've seen has been very positive. If you are new to SID today, here's what it's all about:

- (U) SID today is for all SIGINT'ers everywhere to communicate with each other
(U//FOUO) When SID today replaced the old SID Message of the Day in late March 2003, the idea was to move away from solely a management-to-workforce format into one allowing SIGINT'ers everywhere to communicate with each other via a web "newspaper." Besides articles, SID today includes features such as the SID Leadership Morning Meeting Notes (which has a loyal readership), SID Mailbag, and links to other items that may be of interest to SIGINT'ers, all in one place.
- (U) You, too, can submit an article for posting
(U) If you have a story idea, tell us about it! Use the "Submit an Item" function on the righthand side of the SID today homepage to tell us your idea. This might be a project others should know about, a current event, or even just an opinion you'd like to express.
- (U) You can make SID today your homepage
(U) To find out how, see the article Making it Easy .
(U) Here's to the future!
