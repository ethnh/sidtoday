(TS//SI) On 20 December, SCS Mosul issued three time-critical gists that foiled an attack on a U.S. convoy and led to the capture of 11 insurgents. The first gist, collected at $1741 Z^{*}$, provided a report from an insurgent "spotter" saying a 12-vehicle convoy, including a tractor trailer, was approaching and would reach the target area in approximately 20 minutes. The SCS site tipped Cryptologic Support Team (CST) Stryker Brigade, who immediately contacted the 25th Brigade Support Battalion convoy in question and diverted them away from the target area, and directed Stryker's 1-151st Aviation Unit into the target area.
(TS//SI) At 1804Z, site collected another cut in which the caller complained that the tractor trailer had failed to appear in the target area. At 1829Z, a third insurgent reported that attack helicopters were over his position -- confirming that Stryker's response to SCS Mosul's tipper was right on target.
(TS//SI) The action by Stryker Brigade resulted in the capture of 11 insurgent spotters and attackers associated with the would-be ambush. Total time elapsed in turning the "spotters" into the "spotted" was 48 minutes. Army Brigadier General Carter F. Ham, Commander of Task Force Olympia, stated "SCS Mosul's tip to CST Stryker Brigade definitely saved U.S. military lives."
(TS//SI) SCS Mosul was established in February 2004 to provide SIGINT support to U.S. operations in the northern tier of Iraq. In early November 2004, site's move to Forward Operation Base Marez resulted in improvements to collection access, which permitted site to greatly expand its support to the warfighter. In early November 2004, site was able to provide intelligence that resulted in the capture of several high-ranking individuals, as well as in the convoy division operation detailed above. The site is currently staffed with two personnel, an officer-in-charge and a linguist.
