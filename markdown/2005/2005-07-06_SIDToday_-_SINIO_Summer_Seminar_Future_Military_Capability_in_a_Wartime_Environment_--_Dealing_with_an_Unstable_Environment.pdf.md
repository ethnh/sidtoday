Course Overview:
(C) The Army's massive desert battleground needs to be updated to train troops to fight and stabilize societies in urban environments. To meet growing Intel needs, the military services will need to change the way they educate and train their troops, "If military elements are going to observe at the social level, then they have to have some skills at that level similar to the notion that technical intelligence needs require certain technical skills. For the future, the Pentagon has realized that there will be new elements essential to claim a victory -- one which must primarily emphasize post-combat work, or a level of effective "social intelligence." Becoming increasingly more important to troops in the "new-age battlefield will be foreign area studies, and studies that highlight culture, political systems, languages and social structure. Military power is only one item in a long list of social, political, and economic tasks that will be as important to victory, or even more so, than bombs, missiles, and guns.
