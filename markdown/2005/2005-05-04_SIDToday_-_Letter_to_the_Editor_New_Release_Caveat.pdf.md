(S//SI) Here's a reader's comment on the recent article New Release Caveat on the Way :

# From: 

Comment: (U//FOUO) I'm curious about the notion of a "new DCI Directive" at this particular juncture, given there is no longer a "DCI", and one would assume no further DCIDs would be issued until the DNI's office and staff fully stand up and things get shaken out, so to speak. Just last week the DNI's office issued directives specifying (inter alia) that all existing DCIDs should be considered to be "Intelligence Community Directives" and would remain in force until further notice. Given that the thinking and impetus behind the directive outlined in the article were the product of the CIA-centric Community Management Staff, I would think the new DNI administration would want to carefully consider any pending directives, particularly one as potentially high impact as this, to determine if it was consistent with their vision and direction for the intelligence sharing environment, or if other, more sweeping and fundamental changes, such as elimination of the "presumption of NOFORN" (the source of the problem the new DCID seeks to fix), might better serve the IC's and the country's security and info sharing needs.
