(U) Great Opportunities for Traveling SIGINTers

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA

(C) NSA will deploy over 330 people this year, most going to join Cryptologic Support Groups (CSGs), and Cryptologic Support Teams (CSTs). NSA has so far established eight CSGs and five CSTs to assist in the Global War on Terrorism, and more are on the way. All of our teams receive tremendous praise for their timely and accurate reporting, which is vital to military operations. However, our pool of volunteer analysts has not kept pace with the demand.
(C) We seek SIGINTers willing to volunteer for duty in Iraq, Afghanistan or the Horn of Africa. Historically, we have depended on our veteran deployers to shoulder the burden of filling these positions. In fact, over $90 \%$ of these personnel were willing to extend their tour or deploy again, because they saw first hand the power of NSA in action. Unfortunately, we cannot continue to rely on the same pool of individuals--the rest of us need to take our turn.
(U//FOUO) The men and women of SID who deploy with the CSTs and CSGs complete their job each day knowing that they made a difference in the war. In many cases, the information they provide saves lives. They find the job they did so rewarding that they come home grateful for being given the opportunity to deploy.
(U//FOUO) Even if you currently do not specialize in the CENTCOM AOR, training will be provided to ensure you have the tools needed to succeed, through VuPort classes, culture studies, and an internship with the TOPI, for example.
(U//FOUO) Living conditions for our deployed personnel have improved. Most of our CSG and CST personnel are living in air-conditioned trailers and some in converted houses. Cafeterias offer four meals a day and shopettes for personal items. Our locations are very secure and thankfully, have not had any injuries related to enemy action.
(U//FOUO) In addition, there are financial benefits to volunteering for one of these deployments. Civilians are entitled to danger pay (up to 35\% of an employee's base pay) and post differential pay (adding another $25 \%$ on average, and up to $35 \%$, based on your location). Deployed civilians also qualify for overtime and performance awards. If you are in the military, your entire month's salary is tax-free, and you receive per diem, monthly family separation, and hazardous duty pay. Plus, if you reenlist while overseas, any bonus is tax free.
(U//FOUO) Supervisors: I commend you for encouraging your personnel to deploy. Although their services are dearly missed at home, your office will benefit from the warfighter-tailored worker who returns. Not only will your people return from deployment more focused, with a sharpened understanding of NSA's mission, but also everyone in your office will learn from their experience.
(U//FOUO) For information on deploying to CSGs/CSTs, please call the Expeditionary Group at or "go-NIST." For information on all other SID deployment opportunities, please contact at www.sid. . And, for more information concerning civilian pay benefits, please contact the NSA Deployment Center at
(U//FOUO) Whether you are civilian or military (active and reserve), we need your help. Not only are the benefits remarkable, but the experience you receive, the overseas family you create, and the national service you provide are priceless.
