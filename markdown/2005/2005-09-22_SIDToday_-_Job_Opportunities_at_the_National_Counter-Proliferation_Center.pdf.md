(U//FOUO) Job Opportunities at the National Counter-Proliferation Center

FROM: Kathleen A. Bogner
Combating Proliferation Issue Manager Team (CP IMT)
Run Date: 09/22/2005
(U//FOUO) The National Counter-Proliferation Center is just now standing up and is looking for a few good people. Perhaps you or someone you know would like to be one of the first to shape how this new organization improves the ability of our nation to combat the threat of weapons of mass destruction.
(U//FOUO) The NCPC was created this June. Unlike the National Counter-Terrorism Center (NCTC), it will not be a large organization performing analysis. NCPC will be a small organization ensuring integration, coordination, and information-sharing, located at Liberty Crossing in McLean, Virginia. These are 1-2 year assignments with the option of extending.
(U//FOUO) There may be a job at NCPC suitable for you. If you are interested, please notify your supervisor and contact the Combating Proliferation IMT immediately for further details (DL IMT_CP or 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
