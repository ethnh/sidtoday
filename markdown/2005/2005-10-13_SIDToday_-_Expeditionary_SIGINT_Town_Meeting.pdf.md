(U//FOUO) Expeditionary SIGINT Town Meeting
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 10/13/2005
(U) Please join me in the Friedman Auditorium for a SID Town Meeting on the subject of Expeditionary SIGINT on 19 October, 0800-1000.
(U//FOUO) SID will deploy more than 300 people to crisis areas of the world this year in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). The skill sets they represent will encompass everything from Executive Staff Officers to Intelligence Analysts to Collection Managers to Forensics Analysts. All of our people, wherever they're deployed and in whatever capacity they're working, consistently receive high praise for the work they do in support of our nation's warfighters.
(U//FOUO) The purpose of this Expeditionary SIGINT Town Meeting is to underscore the importance that I personally place on these important positions, and to ask your help in keeping these positions filled. You'll have the opportunity to hear from your colleagues who have supported our nation's highest priorities in Iraq, Afghanistan, or the Horn of Africa. They've come home grateful for having been given the opportunity to deploy. In many cases, the SIGINT they provided saved lives-- it made a difference. This Town Meeting will be your opportunity to ask questions about deployments: where people go, what financial incentives exist, what living conditions are like, and so forth. An additional informal information session will follow the Town Meeting in 2N006.
(U//FOUO) Whether you are civilian or military (active and reserve), we need your help to maintain a strong SIGINT presence in theater. Not only are the benefits remarkable, but the experience you receive, the overseas family you create, and the national service you provide are priceless.
(U//FOUO) For information on deploying to CSGs/CSTs, please call the Expeditionary Group at
or "go NIST." For information on all other SID deployment opportunities, please contact
for information concerning civilian pay benefits, please contact the NSA Deployment Center at . For more information on everything, come to my Town Meeting on 19 October.
(U) This session will be broadcast and gray phone bridged to the field; SIGINT Communications will publish details next week.
(U) I look forward to seeing you on the 19th.
