(U) The Fourth of July is fast approaching. We'd like to gather anecdotes from NSA'ers who were overseas on that holiday, describing what they experienced at that time. For example, did they congregate with other Americans for a celebration? Was the setting unusual?
(U) If we receive some interesting stories, we'll put them together and post them as a SID today article to mark the holiday. Please send your comments to and $\square$ Looking forward to hearing from you!
