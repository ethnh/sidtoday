The below is a follow-up to the recent article "Proposal: Third Party Sharing of Info on Terrorist Threats" (S)
(S) All of the nations that attended the 29 November - 1 December meeting in Hawaii to hear DIRNSA's proposal for collaboration on terrorism and other shared threats have agreed to join with the United States and its Second Party Partners (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom) in this initiative. Plans are underway for the first meeting of the principals of the group, to be held in April 2005. In the meantime, as promised, the US will enable a rudimentary communications system for the exchange of some counterterrorism lead and threat warning information, as well as draft a suggested concept of operations for the new group.
