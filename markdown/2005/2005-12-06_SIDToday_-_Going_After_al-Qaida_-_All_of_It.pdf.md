(S//REL) Going After al-Qa'ida - All of It
FROM:
NSA Liaison Officer to SOCOM (F1T)
Run Date: 12/06/2005
(S//REL) The War on Terrorism is now focused on the whole al-Qa'ida Network, not just its leaders.
(S//REL) In July 2005 the Secretary of Defense signed an Execute Order directing DOD to plan and conduct operations to defeat the al-Qa'ida network. This EXORD broadened ongoing War on Terrorism (WOT) efforts from their narrow focus on al-Qa'ida senior leadership to encompass a target set comprised of the entire al-Qa'ida Network (defined as the grouping of like-minded Sunni extremists who interact, share resources and work -- together and/or independently -toward shared extremist goals).
(S//REL) Commonly referred to as the AQN EXORD (al-Qa'ida Network Execute Order), the order granted the Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) "the authority to direct the actions of DOD participants related to planning, priorities, force selection, and mission activities that are part of the campaign to defeat the (AQN)." USSOCOM's role is not to execute specific actions. Rather, it is to arrange plans and decide on the sequencing of actions by Combatant Commanders, Combat Support Agencies (such as NSA), other government agencies and U.S. allies to achieve WOT campaign objectives.
(S//REL) The EXORD directs DOD to deny the AQN access to the "system of systems" it needs to survive and operate successfully:

# Leadership <br> Funds <br> Weapons, including WMD/WME** <br> Safe havens <br> Communications and movement <br> Ideological support <br> Foot soldiers (recruits) <br> Access to targets <br> Links to supporting governments
