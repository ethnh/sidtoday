(S) NSAer $\square$ is the recipient of the "FBI Director"s Annual Award for Outstanding Counterterrorism Investigation." He earned this team award for work done while posted to the FBI's Washington Field Office (WFO). Specifically, the team was cited for a case in which a U.S. person was convicted of complicity in trying to assassinate the Saudi Crown Prince* (pictured here with Tony Blair). This plot also had ties to the Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qadhafi.
(S) Working together, the Libyan shop at NSA (S2E32), Counterterrorism (S2I), and FBI HQ used metadata and DNI** analysis, as well as travel tracking ("Follow the People"), to corroborate much of the information reported by the Saudi Internal Security Service (Mabahith) in detainee interviews. The WFO used this information to successfully bring an indictment and conviction in the case.
(S) The bottom line? The investigation prevented the assassination and ultimately neutralized a large terrorist cell in Saudi Arabia. The case spawned dozens of other terrorism investigations as well.
