Course Overview:
(TS) While bullets are flying between U.S./Coalition forces and local insurgents on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan, a different type of war is taking place in the cyber world. Anit-US, jihadist groups have established Internet websites containing inflamatory rhetoric or public information that is potentially dangerous to the U.S. homeland and its interests around the world. The jihadist websites have cleverly leveraged Internet technology to produce a powerful IO campaign intended to counter U.S. initiatives in Iraq and other parts of the Muslim world. This seminar will explore a number of issues and challenges facing the U.S. military commands (CENTCOM and Special Operations Command) as they organize and coordinate an effort to counter the contents posted on the jihadists websites by applying selected IO techniques against all aspects of the website targets, including the contents, the users, the website owners, and even the Internet Service Providers hosting the websites. Particular attention will be paid to NSA's ability to support, and participate in, specific types of IO capabilities proposed against the websites.
(U//FOUO) This seminar will be held at the TS//SCI//NF classification level.
