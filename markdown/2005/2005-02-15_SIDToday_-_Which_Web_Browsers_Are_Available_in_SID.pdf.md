Netscape, Explorer, or Mozilla? An update on web browser availability in SID (U//FOUO)

- √Å-(U//FOUO) The most current desktop software loads for both Solaris and Windows workstations come equipped with Netscape 4.7 as the default browser. Additionally, the current Windows load also contains Internet Explorer 5.5.
- (U//FOUO) In addition to having Netscape 4.7 on your workstation by default, there are several web browsers currently available for "post-load" installation on both platforms via a remedy ticket:
-- On the most current version of the Solaris platform (version 8 of the OS), both Netscape 7.0 and Mozilla 1.6 are available. It should be noted that Netscape 7.0 for Solaris goes into the "avoid" state on the NES baseline after March 31, 2005 in favor of Mozilla 1.6.
-- On older Solaris platforms (version 2.6 of the OS), Mozilla 1.1 is available.
-- On all Windows platforms, Netscape 7.02 is available.
- The forthcoming new Windows desktop load (version 6.0 -- to be released for use very soon) will include Internet Explorer 6.0 as the default browser. Netscape 7.02 will remain available for post loading on this system via a remedy ticket request.
(U//FOUO) As a result of GROUNDBREAKER modernization and the SID Desktop Migration/Modernization Program, approximately 82\% of the corporately supported desktops in SID are now capable of running a modern web browser (either Netscape 7, Mozilla 1.6 or Internet Explorer). The remaining workstations are mostly older Solaris machines that must use either Netscape 4.7 or Mozilla 1.1 (the bulk of these are in S2). These older machines are currently being migrated/modernized. While waiting for their workstation to be migrated/modernized, users of these older machines may temporarily be able to use a modern web browser through remote access. Contact www.anestab (www) for details.
