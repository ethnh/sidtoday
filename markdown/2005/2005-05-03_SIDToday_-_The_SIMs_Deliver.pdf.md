First draft of SIGINT Information Management Strategy now available (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) The effectiveness of the SIGINT system in the future depends upon a fundamental philosophical shift in our approach to information management. The shift must focus first and foremost on the customer, analysis, and mission needs rather than the data types or communication modes. Secondly, the shift must support the ability to automatically find, collect and analyze communications from progressively more mobile and globally distributed targets. The need for a clear set of information management principles to guide future development activities is particularly acute with the move to a globally distributed operations environment.
(U//FOUO) The Deputy Directors and Technical Directors of SID chartered a SIGINT Information Management (SIM) team with members from S, S1, S2, S3, SIGDEV, and the Information Technology Directorate (ITD) to create a strategy to address SIM holistically. The team is developing an Information Management strategy that is in concert with the Layered Zone Model to support all consumers of Knowledge, Information, and Data (KID), internal and external, human and automated processing, with strategic guidance for the architecture, design, development and deployment of modernized KID repositories. These strategic principles will guide acquisition, processing, and consumption of SIGINT to meet customer needs.
(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Information Management team has been working to develop an initial draft set of information management principles. They have reviewed a wide variety of related documents and are conducting interviews with key stakeholders in the future SIGINT system. The team has organized strategic principles in the following areas:

- Analytic and SIGDEV Interaction
- Architecture
- Command and Control
- Data model
- Distributed SIGINT system
- Mission Assurance
- Security/legal/auditing/sharing
(U//FOUO) An initial draft of the information management principles is now available at the SIMT webpage: http://www.simt.com/itd/sidint/itd/sidint/sidint/sidint/sidint/.
of techniques including online feedback, collaboration, and personal engagement, the team will continue interviews, sponsor focus groups, refine the principles, and develop a strategic plan forward. Watch for more news on the activities of the team, or visit our website.
