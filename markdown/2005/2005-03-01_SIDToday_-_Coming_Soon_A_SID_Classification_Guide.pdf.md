(U//FOUO) Coming Soon: A SID Classification Guide

FROM:
SID Classification Advisory Officer, SIGINT Policy (S02L1)
Run Date: 03/01/2005

Also: a new development with the e-mail CLASSIFY tool... (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) A new SID Classification Guide (as opposed to the NSA/CSS Classification Manual) is on the way! It will significantly revamp what is considered COMINT. A lot of information previously covered by CCO or COMINT or SI will be proposed for handling outside SI channels. The new guidelines will be very different from what we've known in the past. The guide should be out for review in the coming weeks.
(U//FOUO) Regarding the CLASSIFY tool for e-mail: the version that's soon to be deployed uses REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL as the default (and note that the "and" is gone before NZL... that's the new format). All COMINT that is not marked NOFORN is automatically REL 5-eyes. The 5-eyes designator should be removed from your e-mail classification markings if your e-mail includes COMINT because the marking is then redundant (i.e. COMINT without any special handling caveat is assumed to be releasable to 5-EYES).
