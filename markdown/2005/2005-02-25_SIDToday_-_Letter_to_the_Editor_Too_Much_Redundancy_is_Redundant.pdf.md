(U) Here's a comment on the article Too Much Redundancy is Redundant :

(U) Comment: The redundancies illustrated in the first paragraph of the article are indeed proliferating. Not only do I see them in print, I hear them spoken on the street; and what's more disturbing, I see them in printed mass media such as the newspaper and spoken on television. It all reminds me very much of a book I read several years ago by a journalist named Edwin Newman called "Strictly Speaking." Mr Newman addressed redundancies, as well as a host of other crimes against the English language characterized by the non-word "irregardless." And speaking of redundancies, let's not forget some of the classics, such as "basic fundamentals," "true facts," "each and every," "one and only," "close proximity," "general consensus of opinion," and one of my personal favorites, "flashes of consistency."
