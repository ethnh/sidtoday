(U) Managing SID Property

FROM: Karyn Vice
SID Chief of Staff (S0)
Run Date: 02/01/2005
(U//FOUO) Did you know SID has almost 39,000 pieces of accountable property valued at more than $\$ 639 \mathrm{M}$ in its inventory? And did you know that DoD and NSA regulations require SID that representatives not only know where each of the 39,000 items is at all times and under whose control, but also to inventory each piece every year and laptops/Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) twice a year? As you can imagine, this is a daunting task. Through hard work and communication with the 120+ SID Property Officers, a dedicated SID staff (S02S1) has done an outstanding job managing SID property. This past year (2004) was the best yet -- 99.66\% of all SID property was successfully accounted for.
(U//FOUO) Although unquestionably a good year, we believe we can do even better by improving upon past successes and avoiding various pitfalls. By avoiding a few commons problems, we could reach our goal of $100 \%$ accountability. Here's how:

1. All portable computing devices (laptops and PDAs) must be secured at all times (Policy 6-5, (U) Distribution, Control, and Accountability of Portable Computing Devices (PCDs): http://www.n.nsa/n5/n5p/data/6.5.html)
2. Equipment transfers to other Agency organizations must be documented on a transfer sheet -- form J6576. (Agency forms:
http://www.sigint.nsa/sublevel1/s0/s02/s02s/s02s1/forms.shtml )
3. Equipment shipments (including hand carried shipments) must be documented on the DD1149 web shipping system ( http://dd1149.corp.s.nsa:12080/ )
4. Equipment should not be loaned to other locations. If transferred, it should be documented on a DD1149 shipping document. Note: it can always be transferred back, but if the item becomes missing, it is then the responsibility of the site. If the equipment cannot be transferred and must be noted as a loan, then it is the organizations responsibility to keep track of the equipment while at site and periodic verification throughout the year of the equipment's current location should be made.
5. Every employee is responsible for Property Accountability. Please take a few minutes to determine who the Property Officer is for your organization : http://www.sigint.nsa/sublevel1/s0/s02/s02s/s02s1/poc.html
6. If equipment is installed, moved or de-installed by a local systems administrator, notify your Property Officer with the details so that he/she is aware and can follow up as necessary.
7. If equipment is transferred to Eagle Alliance (EA barcode affixed), forward a copy of the Asset Information Management (AIM) form or email to your PO.
8. In order to maintain the integrity of the property database, it is imperative that all Property Officers receive the proper training. It is the Manager's responsibility to ensure the Property Officer receives the training within 3 months of being appointed. Training dates are available on the SID web page:
http://www.sigint.nsa/sublevel1/s0/s02/s02s/s02s1/training.shtml
(U) In short, Property Accountability is everyone's responsibility. By following these guidelines, SID may be able to achieve its goal of $100 \%$ accountability for all property.
