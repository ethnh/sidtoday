(U//FOUO) ZabaSearch.com: OPSEC Worry?
FROM: Charlie Speight Internet Program Manager (IT Directorate) Run Date: 05/20/2005
(U//FOUO) There have been some emails moving around the agency lately about a Internet search service called "ZabaSearch.com." At this site, you can type in a person's name and state of residence and get back that person's address(es), telephone number and date of birth. For an additional \$20, you can get even more info: bankruptcies, legal judgements, current and previous roommates and neighbors, liens, etc. It also comes with a National Criminal Record search and satellite photo of your address.
(U) As unsettling as this may seem, ZabaSearch is only one of quite a few search capabilities on the web that can provide personal information. This one uses some of the available data (name, DOB, address(es)) as a marketing tool to show what they can provide. To get "the good stuff," one has to subscribe. Subscription information services have been around for years and the information therein (unfortunate fact \#2) is based on public records. And it doesn't take a hacker to get to it.
(U) It used to be that to acquire a portfolio on someone, you had to go to the county clerk or visit other government offices and wade through court and other public records, sometimes paying a fee to do so. Now, with all that information digital, the legwork is eliminated. And there is nothing you can do about it. If you've gotten married, bought property, been arrested, served on a jury, etc... there is going to be information on/about you that others can get.
(U) If you've ever been solicited by an insurance agent soon after you bought a home, (s)he got your name and address from those public records. There is a Maryland state website where you can find who owns a particular house and how much they paid for it (and what the property tax assessment is). Want to know how much your new neighbor paid for his/her house? It's free on the Internet.
(U//FOUO) OPSEC/COMSEC concern? Sure. Is there anything you can do to mitigate it? No ( Note: link not accessible via Netscape 4.7 -- use Netscape 7.0 or Internet Explorer ).
(U) Can you remove your information? No. The source of the information provided is public record. That information is available via scores of web sites, search engines, reference services, court houses, clerks of court, newspapers, etc. This is but one example of the confluence of a free society, the "public's right to know," and technology.
