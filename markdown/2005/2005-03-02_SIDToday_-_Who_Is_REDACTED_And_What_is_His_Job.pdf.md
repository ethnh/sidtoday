We asked to explain his role in SID... (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) Hello, I'm $\square$ the SID Workforce Performance Management Executive. What does that entail? I work with the Agency's Associate Directorate for Human Resources (HRS) and the SID leadership to provide the implementation planning, SID policy, oversight, and execution of our SID Workforce Performance Management system. What does that mean to you? If you have a question or problem with any of the following issues, I'm available to help:

- The SID P3 Process , to include Senior P3s, SID Promotion criteria and allocation strategies,
- SID Promotion Process , and
- SID Awards and Recognition Strategies.
(U) A very interesting experience I've had in SID so far was the creation of a new honorary award - the SID Distinguished Service Award (DSA -- see related story). This award filled a "void" in our SID-level recognition program and the awardees have been impressive (and impressed with the award).
(U) Currently we are in the midst of the NSA 2005 promotion program, and I meet with POCs from each SID Deputy Directorate and intern panel bi-weekly to make sure we are meeting timeline requirements, resolve issues and keep the information flow between SID and HRS open.
(U//FOUO) To learn more about the promotion process, awards and recognition and other performance management topics, please go to the webpage. I can be reached at @nsa.
