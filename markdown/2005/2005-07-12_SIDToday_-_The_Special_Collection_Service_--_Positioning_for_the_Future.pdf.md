(S) The Special Collection Service -- Positioning for the Future

(S) For more than 25 years, NSA and CIA have joined in the very successful venture of the Special Collection Service. Truly representing the "foreign service" of the Extended SIGINT Enterprise, the SCS has transitioned from primarily an access and collection capability to that of a "full service" SIGINT activity. Today, in addition to enabling a multitude of access and processing platforms, it has an ever-increasing role in the analysis and dissemination of information, and a very important customer-relations role with the front line of our national customers and military commands.
(S) SCS management currently participates in Data Acquisition (S3) and Analysis and Production (S2) meetings. Recognizing, however that the SCS really crosses all of our SID Directorates, I've decided to have the Director of SCS report directly to me.
(S) Positioning the SCS within SID will allow us to fully vet the missions we assign to the SCS and the resources needed to accomplish those missions. It will also ensure that we give full consideration to the "extended" customer set the SCS represents.
(S) The SCS management team will participate in the various SID forums where deliberations take place on customer-support strategies, mission alignment, SIGDEV, analysis and production, collection strategies and resource deliberations. As a next step, we will develop a plan to best manage SCS CCP* resources (manpower and funding) in accordance with the broad range of SCS SIGINT activities. I believe these actions will optimize the management of one of our very important assets.
(S) The mission of the SCS will continue to expand as we take advantage of the opportunities this "global network of SIGINT points of presence" provides. One of the factors in the SCS's success is its multi-talented work force -- a work force keen on serving in foreign countries. It is a work force made up of NSA, CIA, and SCE* personnel with skills, knowledge, and experience that span SID, the Extended Enterprise, and many of the corporate support organizations. Their contributions are invaluable and will become even more so in future.
