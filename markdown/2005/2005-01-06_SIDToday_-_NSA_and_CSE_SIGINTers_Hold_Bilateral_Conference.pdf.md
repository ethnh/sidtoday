FROM: $\square$ CDO Canada (DP11), and
Deputy CANSLOW
Run Date: $01 / 06 / 2005$
(S//SI) Signals Intelligence Director MG Quirk hosted this year's NSA-CSE* SIGINT Bilateral Conference on 15-16 November in Columbia, Maryland. MG Quirk kicked off the first day of the conference by briefing the Governance Model, SID's intelligence outlook for the next 5 years (i.e., challenges, requirements and services), as well as its mission alignment strategy with regards to the RSOCs. Bob Brule, Deputy Chief, CSE SIGINT, reciprocated by sharing information on the implications of Canada's National Security Policy on CSE, and provided an update on the Integrated SIGINT Operational Model (ISOM), which is aimed at increasing the integration of CSE and Canadian Forces SIGINT operations.
(S//SI) The second day provided an opportunity for NSA and CSE to exchange lessons learned from the Olympics, NATO Summit and Support to Military Operations (SMO) efforts in Haiti, Afghanistan and Iraq. In recognition for the outstanding support provided by a CSE'er to the counterterrorism effort, Wayne Murphy, Production Manager for Counterterrorism, presented Bob with a memento. Briefings and discussions on NSA's Russia Mission and Strategic Architecture, CNO (Computer Network Operations) collaborative efforts and future direction within both a bilateral and 5-Eyes context, as well as maritime security wrapped up the bilateral exchanges.
(S//SI) Considered a success by both sides, the conference ended with participants looking forward to future and continued discussions on maritime security, CNO and more. Passing reference was made to the 5-Eyes Analysis and Production Conference that was being hosted by CSE on 7-8 December, and CSE pointed out that strengthening its partnerships within the 5Eyes community remains a priority.
