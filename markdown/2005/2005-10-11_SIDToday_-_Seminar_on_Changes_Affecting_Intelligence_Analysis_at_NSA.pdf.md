(U) Seminar on Changes Affecting Intelligence Analysis at NSA
FROM:
Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 10/11/2005
(U//FOUO) When and Where: 13 October 2005, 0845-1600, 9A135
(U//FOUO) Over the last year, dynamic events have swept across the Intelligence Community. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the establishment of the Director of National Intelligence, and the recommendations of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission affected how the Intelligence Community is structured and how each agency relates to one another. NSA's Office of Strategic Intelligence Issues ( S17 ) is sponsoring a seminar on 13 October to look at how these changes in the community have impacted NSA.

Did you know that:

- For the first time, NSA has an analyst working as an editor on the President's Analytic Support Staff, which is responsible for writing the President's Daily Brief and an Executive Support Staff at NSA was formed to support this process.
- NSA's customers have consistently praised SIGINT Assessment reporting as the most comprehensive source of SIGINT. Last year, the Director asked that an emphasis be placed on writing more SIGINT Assessments. A new SIGINT Assessment cell at the SID level has been formed.
- NSA's Intelligence Analysis Authority is creating a way to assess each analyst's ability against similar criteria. Additionally, common standards are being developed for Intelligence Analysts across the Intelligence Community.
- The Director of National Intelligence needs a way to identify what skills are available across the Intelligence Community. Learn how the Analyst Resource Catalog helps keep him informed.
(U//FOUO) Join us as we discuss the changes in the Intelligence Community, how NSA is changing the way we portray our analytic capabilities to the community and how the role of the intelligence analyst is developing across the NSA enterprise. Dr. Tom Fingar, Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis, will address attendees to give a firsthand account of the new intelligence community.
(U//FOUO) No registration is necessary for this event. For further information on this seminar please contact , Marilyn Maines or Dr. David Shore of S17
