Course Overview:
(U//FOUO) Many of the challenges facing Latin America today have significant long-term implications for U.S. interests. Will Venezuela remain a significant source of oil for the United States? What are the implications of having Chavez as Castro's ideological successor? Does the recent trend of electing socialist leaders in South American countries represent an irreconcilable difference with the United States? Will it adversely impact economic relations? Does the rise in populist movements in Central and South America herald a regionalization of the FARC/ELN insurgencies? Assuming success in Colombia, how will narcotics trafficking in the Andean region change? China has become greatly engaged in Latin America -- what are the potential ramifications to U.S. influence in the region?
