# (U) About the conference: 

(C) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce the 2005 SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) Conference. This annual event provides the opportunity for SIGDEV experts from across the 5-Eyes community to share discovery efforts and uncover potential solutions to the toughest SIGDEV challenges.
(U) It is also a great opportunity to network with your colleagues and learn about the latest tools and techniques. As always, we'll be looking to identify the next steps needed to improve our worldwide collaboration efforts.
(U//FOUO) This year's conference will be held during the week of 6-10 June here at NSA. All sessions will be held at the TS//SI level.
(U//FOUO) The theme for the 2005 SIGINT Development Conference is 'Converging Technologies...Discovering Solutions." The conference will open with a keynote address by Mr. William Black, Acting Director, in the Friedman Auditorium at 0900 on Monday, 6 June, followed by a joint presentation by SIGDEV leaders from NSA, DSD, CSE, GCHQ and GCSB.
(U//FOUO) Conference registration begins on 25 April. A volunteer sign-up is now available on line. Workshops this year will focus on discussions rather than PowerPoint presentations. We will also consider presentation topics outside of the main threads, scheduling them as sidebar sessions throughout the week. The major threads for the conference are:

- ASR: Building a Globally Distributed Coordinated 5-Eyes SIGINT Analysis Capability
- Innovative approaches to SIGINT Development
- Linking Target to Network to Environment: Connecting the Dots
- SIGINT Development Support to Military Operations
- Skills Development collaboration: Shaping the SIGINT Development workforce

(U//FOUO) The conference is open to all fully cleared personnel and will be conducted at the TS//SI level, so mark your calendars and start making plans to attend. Contractors are welcome but they must be currently performing SIGINT Development work.
