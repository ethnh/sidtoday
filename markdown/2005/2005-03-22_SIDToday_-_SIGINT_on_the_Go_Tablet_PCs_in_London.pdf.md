Use of lightweight, mobile computers to reduce tedious paper handling at customer locations. (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) NSA is now operating in an era where information technology is omnipresent. Computer based tools enable analysts to increase productivity and accountability, while decreasing the cost and usage of resources. S12 is ambitiously pursuing the modernization of the SIGINT dissemination architecture by transforming many of the manual processes to electronic processes.
(U//FOUO) Many of our SIGINT customers are not connected to NSANet, and must receive this product by alternative means. This alternative usually translates to a tedious and laborious process that must be endured daily by our forward-deployed analysts. Due to the degree of labor involved in the manual preparation of the SIGINT product, this extraneous procedure often times prevents analysts from participating in activities that will better assist their customers.
(U//FOUO) SUSLOL * analysts recognized this problem and the need for change. Analysts residing in the SUSLOL offices are required to manually filter through the released reports of multiple databases and manually select the reports that would be interest to each customer. The reports must then be printed, collated, stapled, and customized to the desire of each customer. Next, the product must then be hand delivered to each customer. In many cases, the analyst must remain with the customer as the product is read, after which, the customer returns the product to the analyst. Finally, the analyst returns to his office, manually logs each report that was produced earlier that day for accountability purposes, and then disposes of the product by shredding each sheet of paper.
(U//FOUO) The Tablet PC will be used to facilitate the aforementioned process. The Tablet PC physically offers a better solution to protect the end product. The write and print capabilities are disabled on the Tablet PC, preventing the reproduction of SIGINT, and it also affords a better system for accountability. It is almost impossible to maintain positive surveillance of each sheet of paper that is produced each day, in addition to attending primary job functions. Using the tablet eliminates the logging of each sheet of paper and accounts for only a USB* and the Tablet PC itself. The Tablet PC also offers the benefits of a searching capability to quickly locate important information and portability.
(U//FOUO) S12 and SUSLOL are currently working together to accredit the Tablet PC for their spaces, but every great effort comes with great obstacles. NSA Regulations state that the environment in which material is processed must be commensurate with the classification level of the material. This precept itself inhibits many of our non-NSANet customers from receiving SIGINT either manually or electronically.
(U//FOUO) Adhering to the NISCAP* accreditation process, we have received preliminary accreditation to operate. SUSLOL analysts will be able to employ the Tablet PC to deliver and view SIGINT product in non-SCIF* areas within the Embassy. We are continuing to work with IAD to satisfy the requirements for a secure hardened Tablet PC. This is a big achievement for the Agency and a small step towards secure wireless dissemination.
