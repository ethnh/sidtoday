(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development's Target Technology Trends Center (T3C) invites you to a festive open house! Come one, come all! Learn about how the T3C researches what top targets are doing with technology. See the creative ways we let our customers know what may be coming in the future. Learn about how tools are being developed to automate some of these research processes. Fun, games, and friendly conversation await you in OPS1 2E136 on 17 March, 1000-1400.
(U//FOUO) If you took the SIGINT Development's Target Technology Trends Center (T3C) survey now's the time to find out what it means. The T3C identified fourteen important technologies coupled with target evidence that impact SIGINT and are driving SID's strategic planning and out year budget decisions. Learn what these technologies are, who uses them, and why they are important to you. Do you agree with the list? Do you want to learn more? Do you want your voice heard for this year's survey?
(S//SI) Does China or Iran interest you? What about satellites, optical fiber, convergence, or wireless technologies? T3C just completed four Technology Placemats that also highlight target use. Be the first in your office to see these!
