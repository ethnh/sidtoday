FROM:
SINIO for Counterintelligence and Denial and Deception (S17)
Run Date: 05/23/2005
(U//FOUO) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present a special Guest Speaker Seminar to discuss, " The Great Game: The Myth and Reality of Espionage " by Professor Frederick P. Hitz of the Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University on Wednesday, 22 June, from 0830 to 1300 in Room 284118-6. Advance registration is required; there are 60 spaces; please contact the SINIO for Counterintelligence and Denial \& Deception if you are interested.
(U) Course Overview:
(U//FOUO) In his book, Professor Hitz contrasts the writings of well-known authors of spy novels with real-life espionage cases. Drawing on personal experience as a participant in "The Great Game" and as the first presidentially appointed Inspector General at CIA, Professor Hitz will show that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. The discussion will include real life spies Pyotr Popov, Oleg Penkovsky, and Kim Philby. Then, he'll examine how their exploits hold up to Bill Haydon from le Carre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Maurice Castle in Graham Greene's The Human Factor . Following this discussion, Prof. Hitz will briefly discuss a topic he calls "The Deceptive Allure of Intelligence Reform." This promises to be a lively discussion of espionage, spy tradecraft and the human dilemmas of betrayal, manipulation, and deceit.
