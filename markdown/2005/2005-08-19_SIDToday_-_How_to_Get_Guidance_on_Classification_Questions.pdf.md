(U) When you need a second pair of eyes on your "5-EYES"...
(U) You have written up a document, but you aren't sure about the correct classification. You've looked in the Classification Manual - Frequently Asked Questions, but still need some guidance from an expert. What do you do? -- Contact your SID Classification Advisory Officer (CAO).
(U) Every SID Deputy Directorate has at least one CAO, whose job is to "provide classification guidance to anyone who needs it." Don't hesitate to ask for help.
(U) You may want to bookmark the Listing of SID Classification Advisors for future reference. It will tell you the CAO(s) for your local organization. Everyone can't be an expert -- but you can know someone who is!
(U) For further information, see the SID CAO webpage .
