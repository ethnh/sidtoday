(S//SI) Unusual Opportunities Await Language Cross-Trainees and Interns

FROM:
Language Cross-Trainee (S2C22/R64)
Run Date: 09/27/2005
(U) Rotations in research are available...
(S//SI) When I signed up for the language cross-training program immediately after 9/11, I had no idea of the variety of opportunities that would become available to me. Language interns and cross-trainees can not only rotate through different branches in their newly acquired language, but they can also do rotations in research (R6-Knowledge Discovery Research Group) as part of a multi-language tour. (These rotation opportunities are listed on the Deployment Services web page..) Being able to work part-time in research and part-time in operations has turned out to be the optimal situation for me as an NSA linguist who wants to help lead NSA out of the "reel-to-reel world" and into the future of leading edge technologies.
(S//SI) I have been very fortunate to be able to work a part-time research tour in R64 (Human Language Technologies) while continuing to work in my operational language, Pashto. When first looking into a multi-language tour, I was reluctant to go on a full-time 6 month or more tour in research fearing that my abilities in my newly acquired language would suffer. But my branch management in S2A44 (Trans-Asia, Afghanistan Branch), and in my follow-on assignment to S2C22 (Follow-the-Money), were very enlightened in understanding the necessity and value of having operational linguists integrated with researchers to assist in developing language tools that address the ever more difficult SIGINT challenge.
(S//SI) Currently my work in R64 entails developing a futuristic (and realistic) user interface for a speech-to-text transcription capability under project OVENCAPTIVE. My experience, input, and opinions as a voice language analyst and transcriber are valued highly by the engineers and computer scientists I work with here. We are also exploring using OVENCAPTIVE as an educational tool, and recently briefed OVENCAPTIVE to members of the Language Enhancement Program and language teachers at NCS. Several of the teachers are eager to work with us to incorporate their classified transcription classes into the OVENCAPTIVE tool.
(S//SI) Another of my goals is to develop an on-line phonetically searchable Pashto dictionary, and to apply whatever lessons are learned to developing on-line phonetically searchable dictionaries in other poorly documented languages.
(U//FOUO) All of this and more is available to language interns and cross-trainees. Make it a priority to explore the rotations that are available to you, and consider a tour in research. Your ideas are valuable!
