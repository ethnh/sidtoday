(U//FOUO) Where Urgent Requests Enter the Building: NSOC's SIGINT Contact Center Desk

FROM:
SIGINT Contact Center and Time Critical Needs Branch (S1112)
Run Date: 06/06/2005
(U//FOUO) Have you ever wondered how time-critical requests are handled when you are not in? Or how the Presidential briefers get their questions into the building? The SCC desk is the answer. The SIGINT Contact Center Desk (formerly the Customer Information Needs Desk) resides on the NSOC floor and is manned 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The watch officers assist customers in getting their requests into the building. They assign those requests to the appropriate OPIs and track their progress. This is especially important when there is no existing process for handling the type of request or it is so urgent it cannot be delayed. The SCC Desk will soon be entirely manned by contractors, a new concept for the NSOC floor.
(U//FOUO) The SCC watch officers coordinate all incoming requests with the Product Line offices, usually the staff officers or branch chiefs. If subject matter experts are not in the building, the officers will address the issue with the responsible NSOC desk officers. Requests come in with as little as one-hour turn around and from every corner of the world. Requests come in from our IC partners as well as from our second party partners. If the customer doesn't know where to turn, he or she usually turns to the SCC desk.
(U//FOUO) What can the SCC desk officers do for you? One of the most important things they can do is track requests and manage them in an organized and timely fashion. They also have well-established contacts with many NSA customers and can work to clarify requests and extend due dates whenever necessary. They can also help get your questions to folks down at CIA and FBI, among others.
(U//FOUO) What can NSA subject matter experts do for the SCC Desk? If you do get e-mails from us, please review them as soon as possible. Although the SCC desk officers try very hard to get the questions to the right subject matter experts, occasionally requests go astray. The sooner we know about a problem with a request, the sooner we can address it. Try to meet the due date. If there is an issue with the request, let the desk officers know and they will be happy to manage customer expectations. If you get a question directly that is outside of your responsibility, please forward it to the SCC desk. The desk officers will gladly get it to the right folks and touch base with the customers about the best way to handle similar requests in the future.
(U//FOUO) If you have any questions about what the SCC desk does, please send an e-mail to DL SCCDesk and the desk officer on duty or our management will be glad to try and answer it for you!
