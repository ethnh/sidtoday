(U//FOUO) In recent weeks I have informed the SIGINT Directorate leadership of the creation of a new, focused approach to responsibilities and authorities within the S01 staff. That construct clearly identifies a responsible focal point to manage a specific portfolio on SID's behalf.
(U//FOUO) Effective 25 July 2005, I designated as the SID Mission Interface for Workforce Issues.
(U//FOUO) In this capacity, ill be the primary staff interface to the Associate Directorate for Human Resources to provide oversight of SID workforce-related processes and activities. She is charged with providing staff support to the SIGINT Director, SIGINT Deputy Director, and SID Chief of Staff as they interact on human resource and manpower issues. She is also charged with working with SID organizations in establishing and maintaining common SID processes and procedures for human resource and manpower matters.
(U//FOUO) has a long history in human resources related work and a strong reputation that she brings to this new challenge. She will be assisted by and , who both also have a long career record in human resource issues.
(U//FOUO) I appreciate the support your staff, especially your Chiefs of Staff, has provided me as I have worked to define a more efficient and effective way to use S01 staff assets.
