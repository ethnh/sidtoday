FROM: Marilyn Maines
Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 06/22/2005
(C) On Tuesday, 28 June 2005 the SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present the 4th in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for the Summer 2005. "The EU Constitution $\sim$ Will it be Ratified? What Happens Next?" will be presented by the D/SINIO for Europe, 28 June 2005 on Tuesday, 28 June from 11:30 to 13:00 in room 2E099. Advance registration is required.
(C) Eligible SID students interested in attending this brown-bag session should enroll for class number 7532 using Peoplesoft. Enrollment will be first come, first served. In case of difficulties with Peoplesoft an email can be sent to Roland Recker (reveredicted) with the following information, and include the course name (AREA 1500 -- "The EU Constitution $\sim$ Will it be Ratified? What Happens Next?"), your name, SSN and organization.

Course Overview:
(C) Several key countries in the European Union have opted to hold referenda on the EU constitution this year, leaving the decision up to their general populations. Since all 25 countries in the EU have to ratify the constitution, some referenda could go either way, and the EU has not come up with a 'Plan B', the future could be rather confusing. What will happen inside the EU and in its relations with the rest of the world should the Constitution not be ratified? Will the EU muddle through and just apply certain aspects of the Constitution piecemeal, or will a serious political crisis ensue?
