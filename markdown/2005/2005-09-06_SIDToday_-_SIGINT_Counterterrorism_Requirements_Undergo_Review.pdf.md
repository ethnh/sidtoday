(U//FOUO) SIGINT Counterterrorism Requirements Undergo Review
FROM:
SID Account Manager for DHS and NCTC (S112)
Run Date: 09/06/2005
(U//FOUO) Over 40 NSAers attended the National Counterterrorism Center's (NCTC) review of SIGINT counterterrorism (CT) requirements from 26 to 29 July in McLean, VA. Representatives from 26 partner/customer entities participated in at least a portion of the 4-day review, which was led by NCTC and the National SIGINT Analysis and Production Subcommittee (NSIAPS). The primary goal of the review was to identify any gaps in requirements as identified by the CT customers who participated and to submit new requirements to the SIGINT system for validation and tasking. The review also provided a forum for the CT Community to identify concerns and more effectively deal with new and ongoing issues.
(S//SI//REL) The first day of the review consisted of several introductory/overview briefings, which set the stage for the remaining three days. These briefings included:

- an NCTC overview,
- NSIAPS role in the review and follow-on activities,
- NSA's GWOT (Global War on Terrorism) and Regional Strategies,
- an Interagency Intelligence Committee on Terrorism overview with an explanation of the CT Tiers, and
- NSA authorities/USSID 18.

The remaining three days were primarily devoted to breakout sessions focused on customer information needs on the following topics:

- global and regional terrorism (Central Asia, Middle East, Asia/Pacific, Europe/Africa, and the Americas),
- CBRN,
- weapons/explosives, and
- Information Operations (IO).

Experts from NSA's CT mission provided customers with a good understanding of what it takes to prosecute SIGINT terrorist targets and overall capabilities of the SIGINT system against these targets. During the review, FBI briefed its FISA rules as well as a basic overview of FBI's domestic role. Also on the domestic front, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provided its perspective on the DHS mission, the importance of SIGINT in this mission, and a draft version of the proposed Homeland Security IN that it will submit to NSIAPS soon.
(U//FOUO) As a follow-on to the review, NSIAPS is establishing a Counterterrorism Working Group which will:

1. capture any new requirements resulting from the review;
2. dedupe, deconflict, and restructure existing requirements;
3. monitor and coordinate new CT requirements as needed; and
4. explore the feasibility of mapping the National Collection Plan for Counterterrorism to existing CT SIGINT IN's (Intelligence Needs).
(U//FOUO) All CT Working Group proposals for changes to INs will be vetted through the Intelligence Community, using the NSRP voting process, before NSIAPS does the final national validation. The Working Group, composed of representatives from NSA, CIA, DIA, FBI, DHS, and NCTC (with observer status), will operate for six months, at which time the NSIAPS members will decide whether or not it should continue.
(U//FOUO) In addition to the NSIAPS follow-on activity, the Customer Gateway Account Manager for NCTC is gathering feedback from the NSA participants in order to provide
recommendations to improve the next SIGINT CT requirements review, which NCTC will hold in 18 months.
