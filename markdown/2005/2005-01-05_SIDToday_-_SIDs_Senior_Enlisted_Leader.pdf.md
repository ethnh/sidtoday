# (U//FOUO) SID's Senior Enlisted Leader 

FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director
Run Date: 01/05/2005
(U//FOUO) The Director recently announced the appointment of Chief Master of the new NSA/CSS Senior Enlisted Advisor (SEA). (See DIRgram-371: "NSA/CSS Senior Enlisted Advisor".) Because our military workforce is so important to the success of our SIGINT mission, I'd like to re-introduce the SID Senior Enlisted Leader (SEL), who is the SID liaison between the DIRNSA Senior Enlisted Advisor, Central Security Service Office and Service Cryptologic Organizations/Elements at NSAW.
(U//FOUO) $\square$ has been in the SIGINT Directorate for over a year. I have placed many responsibilities on him - he wears several hats and fulfills many necessary functions with regard to the SID military workforce. He advises me and other SIGINT leaders concerning the effective operation of the SIGINT system; I rely on him to know inside and out what we do and how we do it. $\square$ also serves as the internal assignment manager for military personnel within SID. He advocates for military personnel and helps to shape policy on issues that affect the military workforce and mission. He keeps the lines of communication open between me and the military workforce and the civilian workforce who serve with them.
(U//FOUO) Over the past year, $\square$ has been the driving force behind many important initiatives within the SIGINT Directorate:

- He ensured that $100 \%$ of the military billets in SID were justified for the recent DOD Validation \& Assessment Board.
- He saw the need to improve officer placement within SID, and he has delegated placement authority to three senior officer representatives at the O-6 level. This process ensures that all officers and warrant officers in our organization receive the guidance and career advice necessary when taking on a mission here at NSA.
- He restructured the enlisted skills shop and the manner in which enlisted service members are placed within SID, using requirements, priorities, and job descriptions as guidelines.
- He also changed the responsibilities of Senior Enlisted Advisor (now Leader) and Senior Enlisted Representatives. Senior Enlisted Leaders bring more than 20 years of experience management, operations and leadership. These Senior Enlisted Leaders will be used in operational rather than administrative areas. Senior Enlisted Representatives are responsible for training, awards, evaluations and counseling.
(U//FOUO) $\square$ commitment to appropriately recognizing our military workforce has brought about an improved system for tracking the awards process that alerts management when an individual is in the eligibility window. We all know how important this sort of recognition is, and $\square$ process ensures that each member gets fair and equal consideration no matter what level the award, and that awards get to those who deserve them regardless of rank.
(U//FOUO) There's plenty more to do to ensure that SID is providing the best possible career opportunities to our military workforce and to guarantee that our military members are providing the best possible support to this Agency's SIGINT mission. If you're a manager or technical leader, you can make $\square$ job easier by helping him to understand what our military personnel are doing (and could do) in their positions and providing him insight into mission requirements, job descriptions, and other management information that will facilitate his work. For him to fulfill his responsibilities to me and to SID senior leadership, he needs access to all areas and information throughout the SIGINT Directorate. I ask you to play your part in providing the right tools and information to do the important work I've entrusted to
him.
