(U//FOUO) Challenging Assumptions and Approaches, Together -The SIGINT Information Management Team

(U//FOUO) Recently you heard from the SID/ITD team that will help shape a series of major changes in our approach to information management for SIGINT. (See referenced article .) This team, hand picked by SID and ITD Deputy Directors and mentored by the senior TDs, is bringing together the ideas and concepts that will drive our future systems development, architectures, and overall approaches to how we prosecute our missions. I'm especially interested in their efforts to explore some of our most basic assumptions and preconceptions about how we build and operate the global SIGINT system.
(U//FOUO) I think the time is right, maybe even overdue, for us to communally challenge and debate many of our established approaches and assumptions to systems and developments. I say this because we are being shaped not only by technologies that are radically changing how our targets operate, but also by new opportunities and trade-offs for how we design and build our systems and services. Add to that our current efforts to reshape our mission architectures, national and tactical systems development, information and infrastructure technologies and services, and transformation programs, and it's pretty clear that we need to aggressively explore new approaches to information management.
(U//FOUO) As you think about information management, don't limit yourself to the data, information, knowledge, or the technology used to store and manipulate them, but instead think in terms of the end-to-end SIGINT system. And remember that the end-to-end SIGINT system starts with mission needs and ends with products and services that support these missions. In between are all the parts and pieces necessary today and more importantly what will be required in the future.
(U//FOUO) I look to you to help advance and embrace these ideas. From this dialog, I expect to see even greater innovation and creativity emerge that will in turn let us quickly adopt and adapt great ideas and accelerate our shift to new kind of SIGINT system; one that is global, selfaware, self synchronizing, agile, and responsive. The SIGINT Information Management Team will become the conduit and champion for these ideas, creating tools and forums to share and debate them, and capturing them in documents and actions that move us from concept to reality more quickly than ever before possible. Our success is dependent on you and your contributions with this team!
