(U//FOUO) The new NSA/CSS classification manual (Policy Manual 1-52) is in effect (as announced late last year in EXECmessage-88 ). It makes several major changes in long-standing classification practices. I've highlighted a couple for your attention:

- (U//FOUO) In the past, NSA used the declassification marking "X1", which meant the information was exempt from declassification for 10 years because release of the material would "reveal an intelligence source, method, or activity, or a cryptologic system or activity." Now NSA has chosen to mark documents with a defined "declassify date," namely, 25 years from the date of the classification manual ( 20291123 ). Note that you should use this date only -- not the date 25 years from the time any new document is created. There are good reasons why this is being handled this way --there's a Q\&A at

- (U//FOUO) Furthermore, COMINT classification/declassification guides are required for all systems, plans, programs, projects, operations, equipment, sub-compartments or special access programs. These classification guides are to be updated by November 2005. After that time, information that isn't covered by a classification guide will be considered UNCLASSIFIED. These new guides will replace Annex C
