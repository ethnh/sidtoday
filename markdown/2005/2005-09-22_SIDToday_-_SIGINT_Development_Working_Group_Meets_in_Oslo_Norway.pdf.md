(S//SI) The Joint NSA/Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS) SIGINT Development Working Group met in Oslo, Norway, 15-17 June. The Working Group includes the following three teams:

1. The High Frequency Data Networks Team is searching for Russian and terrorist networks. The Team has identified 8-10 Russian ALE nets, but no terrorist nets yet. When the EDDA II system becomes operational, it should be possible for the Team to task a geographical area.
2. The Russian C2I Modernization Team is looking for intelligence from new generation systems on Russian Naval ships and submarines being used to communicate with the Russian Main Staff and airborne command posts.
3. The Russian Emergency Management Team is studying various Russian organizations and plans to follow the Barents Sea Rescue Exercise 2005 in September, which will take place off the Norwegian coast.
(S//SI) In addition, the Working Group discussed changes in Russian satellite communications capabilities and a new team started to form to address this subject. The Russians have launched eight satellites in the last 19 months, more satellites than any other nation. The new satellites use spot-beam technology, and Norwegian SIGINT sites may be in the footprint. In addition, the new satellites carry both Russian civil and military communications. Because the Russians lease room on the satellites, non-Russian communications are carried as well. NSA plans to encourage NIS in their approach to civil satellites. The new joint team plans to start by determining which Russian satellites can be viewed by the various NSA and NIS SIGINT sites.
