## (U//FOUO) Assigning USSS Resources

(U//FOUO) In an earlier SID today article (part 5 in this series), you read that the Governance Apportionment Decision identifies the percentage of U.S. SIGINT system (USSS) resources dedicated to exploiting given target sets. The Allocation of Resources reflects the Apportionment Decision and answers the question: "How do we dole out our resources?"
(U//FOUO) The Governance approach to managing the USSS acknowledges the need to more smartly divvy up SIGINT resources -- money, people, and equipment. Why devote 20 language analysts to a target that the Intelligence Community hasn't expressed an interest in for many years, just because the collection system is generating traffic? Let's focus their time on developing a target that our partners ARE interested in, and later, reevaluate that developed target, and refocus again if necessary.
(C) The SIGINT Director has delegated responsibility for the Allocation of Resources to the Deputy Directors of S1 (Customer Relationships), S2 (Analysis and Production), and S3 (Data Acquisition). Using the newest collaboration tool, a Wiki*, the Deputy Directors, Site Commanders, Cryptologic Center Chiefs, and Issue Management Teams (IMTs) exchange ideas related to mission gaps and collectively develop action plans that will support the Resource Allocation (budget build) process. The action plans that have been developed thus far are included in the United States SIGINT System (USSS) Strategic Missions Directive (USMD) and the USSS Strategic Missions Annexes (USMA) document, available on the IMT homepage ("go imt").
