(C//SI) JAVLIN: Streamlining Second Party Multimedia Dissemination FROM:

(U) Chucking the manual process in favor of a new automated system...
(C//SI) Our Second Party Partners are now able to provide multimedia reports directly to U.S. customers via INTELINK without manual intervention from NSA. This is possible through a new automated system named JAVLIN. JAVLIN, developed in Information Sharing Services (S12), supports a Second Party joint effort initiated by the SIGINT Sharing Working Group (SSWG). A product of collaboration, flexible thinking and technical expertise, the new automated process gives U.S. consumers timelier access to Second Party multimedia intelligence.
(C//SI) Until now, the Multimedia Intelligence Services branch within Information Sharing Services has served as the "dissemination broker" for Second Party multimedia reports, manually applying U.S. accepted classification markings to the multimedia portions of reports before posting the reports to INTELINK for consumption by U.S. customers. When the volume of reports increased dramatically, it became imperative to automate this process, to permit posting the reports directly to INTELINK. Due to the inherent risks in automating the classification marking process, a policy decision permitting the automated annotation of classifications upon multimedia was required. The decision permits JAVLIN to automate that process.
(C//SI) As JAVLIN becomes fully operational, Multimedia Intelligence Services will manually process only those Second Party multimedia reports that require manual review for policy reasons. Ultimately, the resources saved within Multimedia Intelligence Services will be realigned to meet increasing demand for NSA/CSS multimedia reporting. However, this is only a portion of what is planned for JAVLIN. Soon, JAVLIN will tackle improvements to the process of disseminating NSA multimedia reports directly to Second Party National SIGINT Organizations. Stay tuned!
