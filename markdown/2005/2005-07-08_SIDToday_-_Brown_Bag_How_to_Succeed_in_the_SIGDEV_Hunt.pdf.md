(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities.
(U//FOUO) This month's featured speakers are $\square$ and $\square$ from the SSG staff, who will discuss Target Templating \& Hypothesis Development: "How to Succeed in the SIGDEV Hunt." Below is a brief description of their planned presentation:
(U//FOUO) Target Templating is NOT simply binning data into portions of the Nine-Layer Model. Today, analysts create Target Threads to "drill down" into layers and map the best target-toaccess link. Success in templating is predicated on the development of appropriate and measurable hypotheses that guide repeatable SIGDEV; define targets for the analytic hunt, provide a framework for visualization and documentation, and enable analytic teams to establish a common center of gravity for collaboration.
(U//FOUO) This session will take the audience on a tour of Hypothesis Development from the analyst response to the Customer Need, to the Assessment of Knowledge Gaps and the creation of a plausible Hypothesis in order to most appropriately utilize the Templating Process.
(U//FOUO) To register for one of these sessions, military and civilian employees can call $\square$ or send an e-mail to the "mpgteam" alias. Please include the CRSK 1500 class number, your social security number and session preference.
