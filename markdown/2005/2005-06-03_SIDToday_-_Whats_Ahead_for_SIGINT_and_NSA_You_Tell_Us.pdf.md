(U) SIGINT Development's Target Technology Trends Center (T3C) has released its annual survey. This year's survey is brief, easy to complete, and open to all. T3C wants to hear your thoughts and garner your insight!
(S//SI) What key SIGINT challenges do you see in the future? What technologies will SID have to exploit 3-5 years from now? Are there unique problems for your target in the years ahead? What questions do you feel need to be asked? What are we missing?
(U//FOUO) For a small investment of your time today, you can make a difference on how the Signals Intelligence Directorate invests its people, budget, and resources tomorrow!
(U) Here is the link to the survey:
