(U//FOUO) Collaboration on Target Templating? It Just Got Easier FROM:
SIGDEV Strategy \& Governance (SSG) Target Templating Lead Run Date: 11/08/2005
(C//REL) SIGINT Development analysts at NSA and our sister Second Party agencies can learn much from each other by collaborating on SIGDEV Target Templating projects. Unfortunately, the lack of a common methodology to date has made it difficult for analysts to collaborate as effectively as they might. Solving this problem is the job of new focal group, which aims to eliminate any obstacles to collaboration in this important field.
(C//REL) With representations from all the Five-Eyes (Second Party) agencies, the group elected to be referred to as the Five-Eyes Target Templating Focal Group. Its goal is to share and leverage information and techniques on the templating methodology. The group met in late September to set milestones and to make near- and long-term plans. What was accomplished?
(C//SI) The group achieved two key goals. First, they established a common set of definitions for the top six layers of the Target Templating 9-Layer Model (see the SIGDEV Target Templating webpage ). Those layers, which are the focal point for templating, are:

- Target Domain,
- Supporting Infrastructure,
- Technology,
- Vulnerabilities,
- Capabilities and
- Access.

Second, they unanimously agreed upon a standardized approach to validating analytic hypotheses. These two steps will make it much easier to exchange information and expertise across organizations.
(U//FOUO) Looking ahead, the Focal Group planned new ways for SIGDEV analysts in all five countries to communicate and exchange information with each other. It also set goals for three years out, including:

- making the Templating Methodology a standard practice among analysts,
- establishing a common course on templating, and
- finding tools to assist analysts in their templating efforts.
(C) The Focal Group is already looking forward to the 2006 SIGDEV Conference where each member of the group will participate in a briefing/discussion on the group's courses of action. In the meantime, the Group will speak as one voice at appropriate Five-Eyes (i.e. the five Second Party countries) events, such as the Analytic Applications \& Information Management Conference at the NSA in late October 2005.
