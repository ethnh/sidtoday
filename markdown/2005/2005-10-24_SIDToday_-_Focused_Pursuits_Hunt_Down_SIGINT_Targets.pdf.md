# (S//SI) 'Focused Pursuits' Hunt Down SIGINT Targets 

FROM:
Deputy Chief, Pursuit Operations Staff (S31104)
Run Date: 10/24/2005
(S//SI) Is your SIGINT target elusive? ...Are you entering uncharted collection territory? A "Focused Pursuit" may be able to help. A "Focused Pursuit" is a planned effort to hunt for a specific target of interest to get needed intelligence. The target that has or conveys the information we want provides the "focus." The "pursuit" is what the Focused Pursuit Lead, typically from the Pursuit Operations Staff, spearheads.
(S//SI) The Focused Pursuit Lead runs the effort and enhances coordination -- it is like Project Management for hunting targets. The Lead brings the knowledgeable individuals, organizations, capabilities, and services of the SIGINT system together to hunt for the target of interest.
(S//SI) Focused Pursuits start with an intelligence question. For example, is Iran planning to put a nuclear warhead on a missile? The Pursuit then targets the individuals who are communicating the information we want.
(S//SI) The Focused Pursuit Lead establishes a pursuit working group of contributing members from the extended enterprise, and partners as needed. They:

- build and write a pursuit plan with specific activities;
- track execution of the planned activities; and
- document an assessment at the end of each pursuit iteration cycle (Gather Target Knowledge/Identify Gaps; Plan; Execute; Assess).
(S//SI) Typically, a pursuit iteration cycle runs from 90-120 days. The Focused Pursuit continues, perhaps through several iterations, until the goals are achieved or customer priorities change.
(S//SI) Additionally, the Pursuit Operations Staff forward-deploys SIGINT Development support personnel to Office of Target Pursuit (S311) Target Branches in order to improve situational awareness on targets and increase our ability to discover new leads, sources of information, and detect and report changes in target communications. The Pursuit Operations Staff offers project leadership, a diverse skill set, and its unique position within Data Acquisition to create and/or facilitate solutions and drive implementation.
