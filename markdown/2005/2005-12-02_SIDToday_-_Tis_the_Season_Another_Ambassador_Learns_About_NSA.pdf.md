(U//FOUO) 'Tis the Season! Another Ambassador Learns About NSA!
FROM: SIGINT Communications and Penny Horgan
NSA/CSS Representative, Dept. of State
Run Date: 12/02/2005
(U//FOUO) We must be doing something right! Yet another Ambassador moves on to a new post satisfied that NSA can provide various types of support. Ambassador Alfred Hoffman, a political appointee who was to assume his post as U.S. Ambassador to Portugal during the second week of November, visited the NCR State office for an overview of NSA. Details of his visit follow.
(U//FOUO) There has been a recent "rash" of visits to NSA facilities by Senior U.S. Diplomats -all of whom had productive exchanges with Agency personnel.** Ambassador Hoffman's 9 November experience was no different.
(TS//SI) Even though the Agency could offer relatively little intelligence directly on Portugal, Chief of CSG (Cryptologic Services Group) State, and CSG European analyst presented our capabilities in light of Ambassador Hoffman's needs and goals. He was introduced to the contributions of NSA and its Second Party partners as concerns his daily read file -- to include reporting about Portugal, Portugal's interests in Africa, fishing, and counterterrorism in Europe.
(TS//SI) Ambassador Hoffman was familiarized with the reporting vehicles that he may encounter and was instructed on how to properly share tear-line reporting with non-SI cleared members of his Embassy staff. He was shown examples of SCS (Special Collection Service) reporting, even though there is no SCS site in Lisbon at this time, and was informed as to how SCS personnel could provide Executive Protection, should the President travel to Lisbon. The Ambassador was even briefed on NSA's collection capabilities, site locations, on the complexities of prosecuting targets in a 21st century communications environment, and on how the 5-Eyes Community operates.
(S) As regards Information Assurance, NSA personnel stressed the importance of the Ambassador's securing his own communications, and the Embassy's, stating that secure communications are only as secure as the environment they are used in. The Ambassador was apprised of many types of secure communications devices and of the need to use protective technologies when those devices are not in his personal control. He was given literature on security products and operational security and handbooks about intelligence and terrorist threats. Finally, the Ambassador was reminded that, even though Portuguese intelligence services may not pose a threat, other foreign intelligence services could gather intelligence on the United States via Portugal.
(U//FOUO) Overall, the Ambassador saw his time with NSA personnel as productive; it sparked great conversation and he walked away with a well-rounded picture of what NSA could offer him in his new post.
