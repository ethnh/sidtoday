# Question: 

(U//FOUO) On 7 July, NSA Daily carried an article about the latest NSAers to be awarded the Intelligence Community Officer (ICO) certification. The ICO Training Curriculum Guide states this: "the DCI team was tasked to propose a program that: established community-based training; established a community professionalization program; valued service outside a parent agency as a prerequisite for accession to the Senior Executive Service; removed organizational and legal barriers to tours outside an employee's parent agency." How well has SID been implementing the goals of the ICO program, specifically the use of ICO as a requirement for elevation to the Senior Executive Service?

## Answer:

(U//FOUO) Graduation from the Intelligence Community Officer (ICO) Program is not a requirement for elevation to the Senior Executive Service level. We are unsure at this point what dirction the ICO Program will take under the ODNI (Office of the Director of National Intelligence) construct, and we do not yet know if the ODNI plans to maintain the program. Nevertheless, no one at ODNI currently envisions requiring completion of the ICO Program for elevation to senior level. Some have suggested that ICO certification should be viewed as a positive accomplishment when considering individuals for elevation, but it is not a requirement.
(U//FOUO) In terms of elevation to senior positions, Ron Sanders, Assistant Deputy DNI for Management and Chief Human Capital Officer, is considering designating certain senior IC positions as requiring multi-agency experience before an individual could serve in that position. These positions would require an individual to have previous experience at another IC agency.
