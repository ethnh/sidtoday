(U) First Overhead Partnership Conference (OPC) Held

Spaceborne Planning Division (S3331)
Run Date: 09/29/2005
(S//SI) In May of this year, NSA's Office of Overhead (OOH) and RAINFALL co-sponsored the first OPC. Participants from GCHQ, DSD, NSA's Extended Enterprise Management, Link Access FORNSAT and Spaceborne Planning Divisions, Overhead Collection Management Center (OCMC), as well as representatives from each of the Cryptologic Centers (CCs), Cryptologic Center Concept Partners (CCCPs), Mission Ground Stations (MGS), and NRO's Ground Systems Office (GSO), came together to discuss various Overhead SIGINT Enterprise issues. OverheadFORNSAT collaboration and a multi-access approach to requirements satisfaction were of particular interest.
(S//SI) Specific conference objectives focused on improving partnerships in order to enhance Overhead's capability to meet current and future requirements. During an aggressive five-day agenda, participants had the opportunity to:

- discuss and understand specific collection, processing, and geolocation capabilities at various locations;
- identify specific technological limitations in collecting and processing target communications;
- understand each sites' resident ability to develop new capabilities to exploit target communications;
- identify opportunities for collaborative development efforts;
- identify and document MGSes' and CCs' critical success criteria for the July 2005 transition to the Enhanced Low Capacity COMINT collection system;
- increase information and data sharing, enhance our global partnerships, and improve our Enterprise customer service.
(S//SI) A recurring theme throughout the conference was information sharing within the Overhead and FORNSAT communities. Both NSA/Spaceborne Planning Division (SPD) and NRO/GSO took a joint action to develop a web portal to capture Overhead capabilities and anticipatory developmental initiatives throughout the Overhead enterprise, providing linkage to web portals of other access providers to enhance multi-access response. NSA/SPD and OCMC are also providing an Outreach Team to educate Community partners on the overhead collection management and system action requirements process. Other outcomes from the conference include increased emphasis on improving collaboration with Second Party Partners by ensuring full access to key information, and renewed headquarters efforts to Overhead mission assessment. The conference also looked at ways that Overhead could help make greater strides in supporting SIGDEV Strategy and Governance (SSG) activities and initiatives.
(S) Overall, conference participants agreed that the OPC provided an outstanding forum for working a number of key strategic and current issues. We learned that whether at NSA HQs, GCHQ, DSD, or in the field, we basically share the same concerns and the same desire to seek solutions; and that we make our greatest progress when we seek answers collaboratively across the Enterprise.
