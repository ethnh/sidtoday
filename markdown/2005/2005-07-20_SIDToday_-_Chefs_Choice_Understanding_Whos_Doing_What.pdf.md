(U) Chef's Choice: Understanding Who's Doing What

FROM: Charlie Meals
SIGINT Deputy Director
Run Date: 07/20/2005

The division of effort among the IMTs, GCMs, and the CT-MMC (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) We've created some new jobs in SID in recent months, such as those in the Counterterrorism Mission Management Center, and the Global Capabilities Managers in S2. In addition to that, we've had Issue Management Teams for a few years now. Some may not fully understand how all of these positions interrelate, or the "lanes in the road" regarding their responsibilities, and some clarification may be in order.
(U//FOUO) First, let's look at the Issue Management Teams . Each IMT is charged with being SID's conscience to synchronize and optimize the performance of the USSS against its target area. What does that mean? It means they look across the entire spectrum of how we approach a target and consider where we can make improvements.
(U//FOUO) When I say "entire spectrum," I mean they involve themselves in everything from policy questions, to training, to budgets, to any operational aspect of how we work a target. Once they've found a shortfall or an opportunity to improve, they meet with SID leadership to plot a course of action. The IMTs are advocates and proponents of activities, but they are not themselves managers. Rather, they identify problems and work with managers (in S1, S2, S3, enabling organizations, etc.) to solve them.
(U//FOUO) Next, there's Lonny Anderson, SID's Associate Deputy Director for Counterterrorism, and the CT-Mission Management Center that he leads. Lonny, on behalf of SID leadership, synchronizes the worldwide CT mission and has the license to "make things happen" on that target. He is responsible for establishing links across the CT mission area. We created this position because the target is of such great importance that we need a dedicated SID-level leader focused on it full-time. He is an advocate for this mission, making sure we have the tools and resources needed to prosecute this target, and operates in partnership with those working CT issues within the Deputy Directorates.
(U//FOUO) The CT-MMC (see related article., now being formed, will be located next to NSOC to allow for close collaboration between the two. The CT-MMC will steer time-sensitive and longterm CT activities around the globe.
(U//FOUO) The Counterterrorism IMT remains in place. Its members are looking strategically at performance across the board -- including that of the CT-MMC. In this way, they'll serve as a conscience for Lonny and the SID leadership, who will use them to look beyond current operations at the "big picture."
(U//FOUO) Lastly there are the Global Capabilities Managers . How are they different from IMT's? For one, the IMT's operate at the SID level, while the GCM's work for S2 (A\&P). Accordingly they are focused exclusively on analysis and production issues worldwide. Also, while the IMT's serve as a conscience to advise and consult, the GCM's directly manage the work force in the production of SIGINT, making sure everyone's talents are being used effectively. The word "global" in their title highlights the fact that they look beyond Fort Meade to oversee production at the Cryptologic Centers (formerly RSOCs) and other SIGINT production entities around the world. GCM's can also influence Second and Third Parties regarding the mission.

# Conclusion 

(U//FOUO) As you can see, each of the above positions serves a different function. Having said that, there is some degree of overlap in responsibilities, and that is intentional. We would rather
have a slight overlap than have things "fall between the cracks." Clearly, this is a less hierarchical approach than some may be used to, and I see this trend continuing as part of our effort to achieve a net-centric cryptologic system. Good communication among all parties is the key to everything running smoothly.
(U//FOUO) I should point out that these changes are not meant to "fix something that's broken." The SIGINT System is a remarkable machine that saves lives every day. These positions are intended to make that system even better in the future.
