Course Summary: (U//FOUO) Despite the concerns of Iraq and the Global War on Terrorism, crises in Sub-Saharan Africa continue to demand the attention of U.S. policymakers. Area 4101 (U.S. Foreign and Security Policy Challenges in Africa) will examine some of the key issues for Sub-Saharan Africa and for U.S. diplomacy in Sub-Saharan Africa. The involvement of external players - including Europe, Nordic countries, Brazil, Iran, India, and China - will be discussed, as will the topics of corruption, the impact of the Millenium Challenge Account, and the vitality of NEPAD (the New Partnership for African Development). South Africa will be addressed in particular, focusing on AIDS and the economy. Nigeria will likewise be a country of focus.
(U//FOUO) The seminar will also address terrorism in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the impact of Wahabism and Islamic fundamentalism. The ways in which several African regions form "insecurity communities" making conflicts easy to initiate, difficult to terminate, and a breeding ground for transnational problems will also be discussed.
(C) Academic speakers include a former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, a former Ambassador to several African nations, and several recognized experts on Africa. The Government speakers include the current National Intelligence Officer for Africa on the National Intelligence Council and senior policy coordinators coming from the State Department and the Office of the Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon.
