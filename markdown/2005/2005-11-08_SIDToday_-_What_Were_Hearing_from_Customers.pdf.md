(U) What We're Hearing from Customers

FROM:
Customer Engagement Program Manager (S11)

(U//FOUO) How much do you know about what SIGINT Customer Account Managers do? Have you ever wished you could look over their shoulders and find out what is going on with a particular customer? Account Managers and others have been recording what they know about SIGINT customers in a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) database**. The information in this system will gradually be made available to everyone on NSAnet, beginning with customer contacts and visit information in December 2005. In the meantime, here is a sample of what the Account Managers have been learning. The information below was taken from database entries for the month of September 2005.
(TS//SI) Clients understandably tend to get upset when their favorite sources dry up, and they often turn to their Account Managers for help. White House customers were concerned in September about the closure of a unique source of Bosnian communications that enable them to know whether certain Bosnian officials are "telling us the truth"; this was deemed "critical" to U.S. policymaking. White House Account Manager is helping customers there understand that the loss of the source is beyond NSA's control and explore other options for getting coverage of that target.
(TS//SI) In a similar vein, the Air Force Space Command was concerned about

the Customer Relations team will work with appropriate NSA elements to address these concerns.
(TS) Sometimes in the course of normal interaction, we discover opportunities for improving our service to clients. CIA/DI Account Manager , responding recently to an inquiry from a CIA analyst, found a mismatch between the client's expectations for how NSA would respond to a Research Information Need (RIN)--namely, that we would search unpublished SIGINT in preparing the response--and NSA's actual practice in responding to the RIN. This case has shed light on the need to clarify expectations for RINs from both the client and SIGINT provider perspectives.
(TS) In another case, while providing training on WRANGLER and GALELITE, we recently discovered that the Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC) was using a version of the GALELITE software, provided by the NRO, that did not have some of the enhancements of the current NSA version. JWAC Account Manager worked with the software administrators to rectify that situation and get their software updated.
(TS//SI) Of course, Account Managers don't just get complaints or find things wrong with NSA's services. Account Manager was happy to report recently that a senior U.S. Government official took special interest in the terrorist threat information uncovered by computer forensics after the arrest of Al-Quaida operative "Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani" in Pakistan. And CENTCOM Account Manager has had numerous opportunities to foster improvements to our service to that important customer, including:

- having a SIGINT outage postponed during the Afghan elections,
- pushing NSA's policy envelope by facilitating the response to a request to perform mobile GSM collection with a Third Party;
- ensuring that Department of Homeland Security personnel entering Iraq would have a way to receive the force protection SIGINT they needed, and
- encouraging CENTCOM's use of SIGINT on Demand.
