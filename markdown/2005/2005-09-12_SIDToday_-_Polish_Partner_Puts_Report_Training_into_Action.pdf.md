(S//SI) Polish Partner Puts Report Training into Action
FROM:
Foreign Affairs Officer for SID/Regional Targets (DP13/S2A)
Run Date: 09/12/2005
(S//SI) Our Polish counterparts quickly master SIGINT report-writing skills.
(S//SI) SIGINT analysts from the Polish Intelligence Agency's Coordinating and Processing Center (CPC) in Warsaw made quick use of the basic report-writing class given by FAD (Foreign Affairs Directorate) personnel in July. Eleven students attended the class, including intercept operators, transcribers, analyst/reporters, and CPC managers. They learned how to organize a report, put the bottom line up front (BLUF) and to lead with a meaningful summary so as to better serve their (and our) customers. Additional time was also spent on what was reportable on each of the Polish targets and then students composed reports in small groups.
(S//SI) Students were very enthusiastic about the training and were quick to grasp the ideas presented in the class. In fact, on the Monday following the course, the CPC analysts submitted two reports to NSA! Both reports were well received by the TOPIs* at NSAW and NSA/CSS Texas and were turned around the same day with only minor edits.
(S//SI) Several offices, including CIHS (Counterintelligence and HUMINT Support) and the Office of Russia, had asked the instructor to provide feedback on the value of the CPC's intercept, and both students and management were appreciative to learn their work was being used. After learning that Russian Border Guards were of interest to NSA, one of the CPC managers immediately directed her senior analyst to produce a baseline report and follow it up with any other reportable information.
(S//SI) This course comes at a vital time in the Polish relationship as CPC analysts prepare to fly solo when FAD's two TLOs (Technical Liaison Officers) return to NSA. Overall, CPC personnel seemed eager to engage in meaningful work and grateful to receive both the feedback and the training. They requested additional reporter training in the hopes of improving even more. While more advanced training will be taught in late 2005, our Polish partner seems ready, willing, and able to take on the challenge facing them in the coming months!
