Run Date: 08/16/2005
(U//FOUO) Are you one of the 165 SID Cost Center Managers (CCM)? If so, you are responsible for several millions of dollars and other resources expended to achieve NSA corporate and SID objectives.
(U//FOUO) CCMs routinely face a myriad of challenges, balancing conflicting priorities, locating and accessing data to accurately determine portfolio performance and financial status; ensuring outlays and obligation rates are achieved, and meeting schedule, performance, and budget requirements. Both new and existing Cost Center Managers need to know the questions to ask and where to go for support to accomplish their business objectives. To assist in meeting the daily challenges of Cost Center Management, help is on the way.
(U//FOUO) The SID Chief of Staff has commissioned the development of a focused effort to support CC Managers. For example, a Cost Center Manager Advisory Committee composed of current and former CCMs and Resource Management Experts has been established to guide and mentor CCMs in the execution of their responsibilities.

# (U) WHAT CCM'S SHOULD DO NOW: 

(U//FOUO) Cost Center Managers can access the CCM Checklist. The Checklist provides detailed information on what you need to know, as well as links to information and resources needed in your role as a CCM.
(U//FOUO) Share your thoughts! To comment or to find out more about available support, type " Go PMF " or visit the S01X webpage for additional information. Look forward to more information on this topic in the months to come.
