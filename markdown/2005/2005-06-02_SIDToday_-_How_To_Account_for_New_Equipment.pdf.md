(U) How To Account for New Equipment

FROM:
Chief, SID Property Office (S02S1)
Run Date: 06/02/2005
(U) Do you create and/or process Procurement Requests (PRs) for your organization? Are you the internal delivery point of contact on a PR? If so, do you know your responsibilities in regards to property accountability?
(U) Whether you are a Property Officer (PO) or not, if your name is listed on the "Internal delivery" block \#13 on a PR -- you do have property responsibilities. We hope to help you understand those responsibilities and insure the property database stays up to date.
(U) Here's how the process works:

1. When a) Agency Owned Accountable Property (AOAP) valued at $\$ 5000$ or more and b) all computers, servers, laptops \& PDAs (regardless of cost) arrive at the Dorsey Road Warehouse (DRW), their receipts are entered in the NSA logistics receiving system.
2. Line Item Receiving Reports (LIRRs) are sent to the SID Property Office and a copy is sent along with the new equipment.
3. The SID Property Office associates Debit Numbers from the LIRRs with appropriate PRs in a tracking log to note equipment arrival.
4. The name listed on the "Internal Delivery" is the first point of contact and responsibility for property accountability. The SID Property Office will enter the action in the Property Actions Tracking Log and then email the required property actions to the internal delivery point of contact receiving the property, the responsible Property Officer (PO) and the manager.
5. All new accountable equipment must be barcoded and entered into the Agency database as soon as practical, not to exceed 5 working days, per Resources Management Manual (RMM), Part V, Chapter 14
6. To complete and close out an action contained in the email, the POC or the PO will complete the receipt process via return email, including barcode information or form J7236 "New Equipment Tagging Form." If you feel the equipment should not be barcoded, an explanation must be provided. The SID Property Office will review and either close out the action in the tracking log or contact the PO and/or POC to explain what is still required.
