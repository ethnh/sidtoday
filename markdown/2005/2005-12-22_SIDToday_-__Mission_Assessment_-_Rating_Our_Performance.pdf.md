(U) Mission Assessment - Rating Our Performance

FROM: SIGINT Communications

Run Date: 12/22/2005
(U//FOUO) In this series we've defined Governance and explained that there now exists a process for discerning NSA's missions. Now we'll address another aspect of Governance -- the need to continually gauge our SIGINT performance and seek areas for improvement. This step in the Governance process is called Mission Assessment .
(U//FOUO) Mission Assessment is a look into the success and health of our efforts against targets within the Strategic Mission List (SML)*. This process** is the responsibilty of the Issue Management Teams (IMTs).

## (U) How Will We Measure Our Success?

(S//SI) The USSS will evaluate itself -- in accordance with Governance Task \#1, Responsibility \#3 -- by assessing product and redirecting efforts as needed in order to accomplish its missions.
(S//SI) Our performance against each Focus Area target, within each of the missions listed in the SML, is discussed at monthly Mission Assessment meetings attended by SID Senior Leadership and members of the IMTs. During these meetings, the performance of each mission is evaluated in two categories:

- Diagnosis -- How are we doing now compared to last month? Has our performance improved? Stayed the same? Declined?
- Prognosis -- Do we believe that our performance for the next 12-18 months will improve, stay the same, or decline?
(S//SI) Assessment results will be shared with the Extended Enterprise via a Worldwide video teleconference. You can also view the Latest Mission Assessment Briefing on the SID homepage, in the Governance section.
(S//SI) Both the diagnosis and prognosis are assessed in accordance with "SIGINT Readiness Definitions," which are based on guidelines reflecting SIGINT Performance, rather than SIGINT capability. Those definitions are as follows:
- Level 1: Good performance - able to make critical contributions to mission success consistently;
- Level 2: Fair performance - able to contribute mission success often;
- Level 3: Limited performance - able to contribute only occasionally, mission success possibly in jeopardy;
- Level 4: Poor performance - not contributing to mission, mission success probably in jeopardy.


## SERIES: <br> (U) Governance Topic-of-the-Day

1. Bringing Governance to the USSS
2. Inquiring Minds ... What Does Governance Mean?
3. Mission Discernment - What's Tops on Our List?
4. Mission Assessment Rating Our Performance
5. Apportionment of Strategic Efforts -Our Plan of Attack
6. Assigning USSS Resources
(U//FOUO) Assessment levels 1-4 above are reflected in Mission Performance charts by the colors green, yellow, orange, and red , respectively. The markings on those Stoplight Charts reflect changes in mission performance. An improvement in mission diagnosis is noted by a plus sign; a decline, by a minus sign. Arrows pointing up, down, or sideways suggest an upward, downward, or stable mission prognosis.
(S//SI) There can be several reasons why a target's performance becomes orange (limited) or red (poor) -- access, resources, etc. As a part of the Mission Assessment process, IMTs brief senior leadership on capability shortfalls for those orange and red targets and are responsible for improving their performance -- hence, "The Challenge of the Reds and Oranges ."
(U) Notes:
*(S//SI) Links to these lists, which are updated monthly, can be found in the "Missions List," appearing at the end of the Mission Discernment document.
