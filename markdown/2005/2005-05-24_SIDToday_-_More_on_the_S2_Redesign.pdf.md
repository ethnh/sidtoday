# (U//FOUO) More on the S2 Redesign 

FROM: Carl Johnson
SID/Deputy Director for Analysis \& Production (S2)
Run Date: 05/24/2005

Last week, MG Quirk announced the redesign of S2 (see article ). Here are the latest developments... (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) The redesign of the Analysis and Production Directorate is progressing at pace, and with the announcement of the S2 leadership team, we are well on our way towards implementation of this exciting plan. The new framework will not only optimize A\&P's existing strengths, but it will also provide the necessary construct to enable the A\&P workforce to operate in a seamless, global, net-centric environment. This is not about "boxology", but rather about positioning the A\&P workforce to play their positions as the Agency continues to transform, moving towards expeditionary cryptology while we support current and emerging threats. We are positioning ourselves to win, and the A\&P redesign is the next step in our strategy. A visual depiction of the redesign is also available.
(U//FOUO) The new positions introduced in the redesign will address the strategic, capabilitiesbased, end-to-end responsibilities required in this net-centric environment. They will enable more efficient communications and decision-making, and will also provide the flexibility we need to respond in this rapidly changing environment.

- The S2 Chief of Staff will have broad responsibilities for corporate and operations staff functions with shared oversight of budget, plans, programs, architecture and requirements for systems and tools that enhance analysis and production across the extended NSA/CSS enterprise.
- The S2 Group Chiefs will have broad responsibilities for strategic and global initiatives, with the focus on transformation, integration, knowledge management and interface with enablers across the cryptologic enterprise.
- The Global Capabilities Managers (GCM) are charged with end-to-end operations of the Product Line, to include assigning mission responsibilities to production centers, and working with the Cryptologic Center Chiefs in Denver, Georgia, Hawaii and Texas to align resources, maintain capabilities, and optimize production across national and tactical missions.
- Managing the largest Production Center is the responsibility of the Primary Production Center Managers (PPCM).
- The Production Center Leads have the charge to manage day-to-day operations at a Production Center.

Finally, all PPCMs and Production Center Leads will work with the GCMs to coordinate and optimize worldwide production and current operations.
(U//FOUO) The two transition teams I commissioned several weeks ago have been engaged in developing a framework for the transition plan, with much focus to date on identifying the decisions that need to be made and determining at what level they should be made. The teams, which include membership from each of the Cryptologic Centers, are developing a workforce engagement strategy, which will be announced within the next week.
(U//FOUO) We recognize that the S2 workforce has much to offer as we progress through the transition, and we want to capitalize as much as possible on the experiences and expertise of the workforce as we develop the transition strategy. Please be receptive to opportunities to participate in this process -- your input is vital to our success.
