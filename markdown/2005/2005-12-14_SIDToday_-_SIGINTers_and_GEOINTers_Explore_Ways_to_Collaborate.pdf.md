(U//FOUO) SIGINTers and GEOINTers Explore Ways to Collaborate FROM:
CSRC's Office of Partnerships and Strategic Issues (S3C1)
Run Date: 12/14/2005
(U//FOUO) The collection organizations of SID and NGA see benefits in working together.
(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Directorate's Data Acquisition (DA, S3) hosted the first NSA Data Acquisition and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) SOURCE Information Exchange at NSA on 17 October 2005. NGA's Source Directorate mission is to discover, acquire, and deliver all the data and information used to create Geospatial Intelligence.
(U//FOUO) Leadership representatives from both DA and SOURCE met to achieve greater understanding of the capabilities of each organization, and to increase networking and collaborative opportunities between Data Acquisition and SOURCE, which will ultimately strengthen intelligence collection for our nation's security.
(U//FOUO) The Intelligence Community (IC) has long recognized the critical need for much greater "horizontal integration" of operations among the various intelligence disciplines and between the IC and its partners. The collaboration between NSA and NGA is just one example of NSA's quick response to this need. An NGA liaison, has worked with the CRSC strategy division since 2003, and in 2005 that collaboration was broadened to include a senior CSRC representative, Peter Rowley, at NGA.
(U//FOUO) The event included overview briefings on both DA and SOURCE missions and an example of a success story demonstrating how combining GEOINT and SIGINT can solve seemingly intractable intelligence problems. Both groups articulated the value of this meeting and indicated that further exchanges of information and contacts will continue.
