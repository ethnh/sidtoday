(U) Speak Easy: Creating Notes (repost)

FROM:
Meadeators Club
Run Date: 07/01/2005

For most people, public speaking is a learned skill. Today we present the first in a new monthly column with tips on how to give better speeches. The author is an officer of the Meadeators Club. $\square$ holds the rank of Advanced Toastmaster, Bronze. (U//FOUO)
(U) A good presentation doesn't just happen -- it is a culmination of preparation that takes about ten times as long as the speech itself. You need to gather data, organize it, write it down, prepare materials, and rehearse.
(U) In order to develop your monologue, it will help to write down everything that might be pertinent; you can always remove what you don't need later. Write it exactly as you would like to say it. Make sure your speech has a definite introduction, body, and conclusion. For example, your opening paragraph might be something like:

- Hello. My name is $\square$ I am Chief of the Transylvanian Traffic Office. Welcome to the weekly Transylvanian intelligence briefing. Today I will address three urgent issues: spiders on the Web, bats in our belfry, and network attacks by vampires.
(U) Once you've written your entire speech, print it out. Read it aloud, making additions/deletions as you see fit. Do this until you're comfortable with your material and you have it mostly memorized.
(U) The next step is to create "bulletized" notes to be used during your presentation. Remember, when you give your speech, you should look at the audience and/or presentation materials (charts, maps, graphs). You'll want to minimize your use of notes, and you must find the information you're looking for as quickly as possible, so you will not want to have verbatim notes in front of you. For example, your opening paragraph can be bulletized as follows.
- intro
- spiders on Web
- bats in belfry
- network attacks by vampires
(U) This way, if you forget the items in your list, you won't have to sort through a bunch of verbs and prepositions; they'll be neatly located on the left side of the paper.
(U) Print the bulletized notes in a large font. I use Verdana 18 . Audiences become distracted when the speaker has to lean down in order to read something from the lectern. You should be able to read your notes while standing up straight.
(U) Now practice your speech using the notes. Make sure you can recite it in its entirety; if you can't, then your notes might need to be beefed up.
(U) Next month: Dress Rehearsal
