(U//FOUO) New 'Persian Rapid Response Cell' Aims to Fill Linguistic Gulf

FROM:
PRRC

(U//FOUO) Small team of experienced Persian linguists to assist in surge operations, mentor junior linguists.
(U//FOUO) Last week, SID and the Senior Language Authority established a new unit: the Persian Rapid Response Cell (PRRC). The PRRC, currently composed of three senior Persian language analysts from three separate product lines, is designed to provide a flexible response to crisis-related surges that demand experienced and qualified Persian language analysts. Equally as important as their production responsibilities, PRRC members also mentor and provide operational training to junior Persian language analysts, who are spread across multiple product lines at NSAW.
(U//FOUO) The PRRC was formed in response to several ongoing factors. One is that as concern over Iran's activities continues to grow, so do the demands and workload on NSA's Persian language analysts, who are deployed in S2E, S2G, S2D, S2C, S2I, etc. SID's Persian language resources are easily spread thin and often unable to respond rapidly and flexibly to surge situations. Additionally, a significant number of Persian linguists are new hires or new in the language and require focused mentoring, wherever they are deployed. The PRRC proposal contains more information on the PRRC's role and functions, and the reasons it was formed.
