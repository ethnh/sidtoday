(U) The SID Human Resources Service Center (HRSC) provides human resources services and support to the SID organization. Our staff serves in several different roles to support SID employees and managers, including: Generalists, Program Managers and Technical Specialists.

- Human Resources Generalists provide a variety of services to SID employees to include calculating prior civilian/military service, facilitating LWOP (leave without pay) requests and providing guidance on policies and procedures.
- Our HR Program Managers work with SID managers on a variety of programs such as awards, manpower and staffing.
- HR Technical Specialists process all personnel actions documenting any change to an employee's personnel record such as reassignments, awards, benefits changes and data changes to the employee's profile.
(U//FOUO) We are organized in teams, focusing on the unique customer requirements of each SID Deputy Directorate or Special Office. If you're looking for HR support and/or services, visit the MD6 website to find out who can assist you.
