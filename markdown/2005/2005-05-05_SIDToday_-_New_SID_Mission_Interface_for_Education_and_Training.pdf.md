(U//FOUO) New SID Mission Interface for Education and Training
FROM: Dr. Leonard T. Reinsfelder
SID/Deputy Chief of Staff for Integrated Planning (S01)
Run Date: 05/05/2005
(U//FOUO) Effective today, I am designating SID/Deputy. as the SID Mission Interface for Education and Training. In this capacity, $\square$ will be the primary staff interface to the Associate Directorate for Education and Training (ADET) on all SID training issues. $\square$ is charged with providing staff support to the SIGINT Director, SIGINT Deputy Director, and SID Chief of Staff as they interact with ADET. She is also charged with working with SID organizations in establishing and maintaining common SID processes and procedures for training matters.
(U//FOUO) has a long history in training related work and a strong reputation that she brings to this new challenge. She will be assisted by $\square$, who also has a long, distinguished career record on training issues. To ensure we include the entire cryptologic community, SGM $\square$, SID Senior Enlisted Leader, has provided MSG $\square$ to the team to work all training issues for SID military personnel.
(U//FOUO) This position is the first in a series of changes I'll be making within S01 that will more efficiently focus SID staff resources and provide clarity to SID leadership and SID personnel. Over the next few weeks, I will be introducing several other SID Mission Interface personnel in other areas. I appreciate the level of cooperation I have received during my first few months as SID Deputy Chief of Staff for Integrated Planning and I look forward to your continued cooperation as we work to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the S01 workforce with the goal of improved support to the SIGINT Directorate.
