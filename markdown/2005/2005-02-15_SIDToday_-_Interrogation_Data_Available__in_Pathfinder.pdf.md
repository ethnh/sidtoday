(S//REL) Interrogation Data Available in Pathfinder

SSG/Operations Orchestration
Run Date: 02/15/2005

Iraq interrogation reports now available (S//REL)
(S//REL) Do you need the ability to quickly search Iraq interrogation reporting for personalities, aliases or cover terms used by Anti-Coalition Forces? Do the 76 cover terms used for Internet communication by Ibrahim Abdul Karim Telakoi (aka Omar Baziyani plus his other 5 alias names) interest you?
(S//REL) Did you know that one source recently reported his methods for staying in contact via cell phones during strikes on US forces? Do you need the false names used by Al-Qaida leadership or the Mujahadeen chief in Samawa's mobile phone number?
(S//REL) If this data is vital in your SIGINT Development activities, then you need to request access to the newly established PATHFINDER Data Set TIRs_IQ* [Tactical Interrogation Reports -- Iraq]. Currently, there are over 7,000 reports in this data set (from May 2004 to present) and more added weekly (from the SIGINT Development Leads Developer in Baghdad). To establish a PATHFINDER account, please follow the instructions at:
(Content Source Documents: SIR-1CD-312-DIF-05-0091-D0331 / SIR-1CD-312-DIF-04-1185-D0234 / SIR-1CD-312-DIF-05-0015-D0331)
