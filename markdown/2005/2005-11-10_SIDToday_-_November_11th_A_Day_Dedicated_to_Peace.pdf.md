(U) November 11th: A Day Dedicated to Peace

In 1954, President Eisenhower signed a bill proclaiming November 11th as Veterans Day. He call for Americans everywhere to rededicate themselves to the cause of peace. In America, this holiday has had a long history of dedication to peace. Originally, the holiday universally recognized the celebrated ending of the World War I hostilities at 11 a. m., November 11, 1918 (the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month).

Today we thank all the men and women who have served in our military service to ensure that we have the opportunity -and the privilege - to live in a peaceful land. Nearly 30 million Americans have served or are currently serving around the globe in he Active, Guard and Reserves components protecting our nation.

Likewise, we should not forget our strongest allies who have stood by us in this Global War on Terrorism and other such conflicts: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. As we do during Memorial Day, on November 11th they will celebrate Remembrance Day to honor their service members who have given the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.

Please join me in honoring all veterans today. They are all around us. They are your grandfathers, your grandmothers, your father, your mother, uncles, aunts, your sons and daughters. And they might even be the guy or gal sitting in the next cubicle!
