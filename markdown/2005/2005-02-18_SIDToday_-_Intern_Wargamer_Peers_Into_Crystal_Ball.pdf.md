(U//FOUO) Intern Wargamer Peers Into Crystal Ball

Wargamers look at what the world may be like 15 years from now... Will NSA be ready for it? (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) As a Cryptanalysis Intern, I was recently presented with the opportunity to participate in the NSA Transformation 2.0 Wargame. The purpose of the wargame was to test the effectiveness of NSA's Transformation 2.0 Concept of Operations (CONOP) in future scenarios. Simulated in the year 2020, the game involved NSA personnel as well as many other Intelligence Community Members, including: FBI, CIA, NRO, NGA, NORTHCOM, etc.
(U//FOUO) The wargame was hosted by NSA/CSS Corporate Planning, Requirements and Performance (DC4) in association with Toffler Associates. Although NSA often participates in planning activities, this wargame was the first time the NSA used scenario planning to test the Transformation 2.0 CONOP. The simulation involved four different "worlds," or global situations, for the year 2020. Each world represented a different extreme for variables such as technology, economy, and terrorism in the future. Each of the four teams looked at a different "world" and provided Predictive, Operational, and Gap Analyses to the Combatant Commander (COCOM). The Gap Analysis showed what NSA and the Intelligence Community needed to do between now and 2020 in order to perform at their best, operationally.
(U//FOUO) Two scenarios were created for each of the four "worlds." My team's first scenario involved an aggressive nation that planned to invade a land of strategic importance to the United States. During the Gap Analysis, we determined that NSA and the entire Intelligence Community needed to successfully produce an integrated "INT" system (HUMINT, SIGINT, COMINT, IMINT, ELINT, SENSINT, etc). Some main points included a need for: increased data sharing across the Intelligence Community, SID/IAD integration, continued growth in NSA's technology, and a review of policy issues. The second scenario focused on how the Intelligence Community reacted to continuous terrorist attacks on United States soil. The Gap Analysis for this scenario focused on NSA's policy and role in internal conflicts. Each team provided the COCOM with an Intelligence Plan for both of their scenarios.
(U//FOUO) During the second day of the wargames, we were asked for ideas and comments that we had not had a chance to mention the previous day. I noted that potential changes in cryptology were not addressed. None of the groups mentioned the state of cryptology in the year 2020 and how this state could affect NSA's production of SIGINT.
(U//FOUO) At the end of the two days, we established key "take-aways" from the four worlds to present to Deputy Director Bill Black. My "take-away" was that the NSA needed to do a better job retaining its new hires. Highly technical backgrounds make new hires marketable to IT and contracting companies. NSA needs to work on keeping the talent it has in addition to obtaining new talent. The group "take-aways" focused on the need for cooperation across the Intelligence Community, integration of SID/IAD, and the many policy issues within NSA.
(U//FOUO) Participating in NSA Transformation 2.0 Wargame was a positive learning experience. I was given the opportunity to work with a group of talented individuals and make connections that have continued to develop even after the exercise was completed. During this wargame, interns were able to provide new ideas, skills, and experience to all of the discussions. I believe there was a consensus that input from a wide variety of people is beneficial for meetings of this nature.
