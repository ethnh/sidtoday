Run Date: $11 / 29 / 2005$
(U//FOUO) You may be surprised to learn that Operations Research, Modeling and Simulation activities are an integral part of many of the tasks being performed not only in SID, but throughout NSA! On 14 November 2005, DIRNSA signed NSA/CSS Policy 2-17, which assigns responsibilities for the corporate management of Modeling and Simulation activities conducted here at NSA/CSS. It also establishes the NSA/CSS Executive Council for Modeling and Simulation EXCMS) to oversee and provide corporate guidance for all NSA/CSS Modeling and Simulation activities.
(U//FOUO) This policy establishes a management and administrative structure for the oversight, coordination, and communication of NSA/CSS Modeling and Simulation activities to ensure that:

- (U//FOUO) Investments promote the enhancement of NSA/CSS modeling and simulation technologies in support of operational needs, technical and managerial analysis, decision analysis, training needs, and the acquisition process through the annual publication of the NSA/CSS Modeling and Simulation Master Plan;
- (U//FOUO) Modeling and simulation efforts are developed using common tools, methodologies, and current data;
- (U//FOUO) Standards and protocols are established that promote the interoperability, data exchange, open system architecture, and software reusability of M\&S applications; and
- (U//FOUO) Unintentional duplicative or overlapping modeling and simulation efforts/activities are eliminated.
(U//FOUO) For further information, please view the policy at:
NSA/CSS Policy 2-17
