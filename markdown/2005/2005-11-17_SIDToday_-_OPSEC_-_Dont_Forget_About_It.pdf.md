# (U) OPSEC - Don't Forget About It! 

FROM: Prudence the OPSEC Dragon Sponsored by the SID OPSEC Program Office (S02L3) Run Date: 11/17/2005
(U//FOUO) Hi there. It's Prudence the SID OPSEC mascot once again. It's been a while since I've talked with you. So, I thought with the holidays approaching and so many of us making travel plans and reservations, that it would be a good time to get out of my cave and stoke the OPSEC fires a bit. We all may have repeatedly heard some of the tried but true OPSEC slogans, such as " One Person's Trash is Another's Treasure ," " Loose Lips Sink Ships " and " Think Before You Speak " are still worth some thought and attention especially in today's times and conditions.
(U) Also, please keep in mind as you travel about locally, nationally and especially internationally that those whom we consider our adversaries could be, and quite possibly are, nearby looking to pick up on even the smallest nuggets of information that could give them some type of indication of our intentions and plans. Make OPSEC a part of your daily routine both at work and in your personal lives. To help, I've gathered a few hints and ideas as to what we should and shouldn't do both in our personal and work-related environments.

- (U) Know what types of personal, sensitive or critical unclassified information you may want or need to protect
- (U) Determine who may pose a risk to the information you've identified
- (U) Look at how you conduct your business to see if you could possibly be putting your information at risk
- (U) Think about the cost, if any, if the information is lost to an adversary
- (U) Protect information placed on the Internet, budget information (personal and official), milestones and schedules as well as documents with personal or sensitive information
- (U) Be cautious when and where you hold personal and or work-related discussions, use wireless communication devices (cell phones, PEDs, etc) or send information out over unclassified fax lines
- (U) Vary your schedule and routine
- (U) When you'll be away from home for any length of time, remember to stop your newspaper delivery and your mail, turn-off the answering machine on your phone as well as use variable timers for interior and exterior lights.
- (U) Always be cautious when you are unexpectedly contacted by someone that you don't know
- (U) Pay attention to and report, if necessary, any unusual activities or individuals you may see
- (U) Don't let sales clerks, waitresses or others disappear from view with your credit or debit cards
(U//FOUO) Before I go, I'd also like to give you a list of some external websites that you may find useful. Check them out and see what you think.

(U//FOUO) I hope this information is useful for you and your families.

(U) Well, I'm off to my lair to rest up a bit. But, please keep one thing in mind ... "OPSEC doesn't end when you leave the office."
