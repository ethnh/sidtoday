(U) Write Right: Still More on the Traffic Fairy
FROM:
of the Reporting Board (S12R)
Run Date: 12/19/2005
(U//FOUO) We had no idea that the Traffic Fairy was a bane on so many levels. The August column, which warned against including extraneous information in a report, brought e-mails informing us that the opposite problem exists: the assumption that one piece of traffic equals one report, even when the same event or situation is dealt with in several pieces of intercept. Several senior reporters described their efforts to overcome this delusion in their workcenters.
(U) There appear to be two reasons for this phenomenon: the bean-counting mentality, and lack of organizational writing skills. An increase in reporting is a Good Thing, right? Higher numbers in the periodic statistics impress management when it comes to rewards, and if the numbers are presented without comment, or are not examined in depth, the $1=1$ mentality is reinforced to the detriment of the ability to integrate related material in one piece.
(U//FOUO) Never mind that it is a disservice to your customer to make them read half a dozen reports on the same situation or event to get a complete picture. If it's not time-sensitive, hold onto it while you search for related, corroborative material, and integrate that information to optimize the presentation of the situation. Your customer will thank you.
