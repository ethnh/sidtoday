(U) SID Diversity Focus Sessions - Help Needed!

FROM:
SID Diversity Manager
Run Date: 11/23/2005
(U) In response to MG Quirk's goal of acquiring world-class diversity training for the SIGINT Directorate, we have contracted with ProGroup, Inc., a Minneapolis-based diversity consulting firm, to design a curriculum for leadership, managers, and the workforce.
(U) We are looking for volunteers to participate one of 15 non-attributional focus sessions to provide information that will help design this curriculum. Information gathered will assess the current climate of the organization and allow ProGroup to tailor a program that is responsive to our needs.
(U) Please consider participating in a focus session for your particular affinity group. This endeavor needs all perspectives and your contributions will be critical to creating the best possible program for SID. Please register to attend a focus session no later than 30 November. We need your help.
