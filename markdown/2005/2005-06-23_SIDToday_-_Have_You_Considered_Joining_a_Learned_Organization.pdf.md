(U) There are many professions at work in SID: linguists, mathematicians and cryptanalysts, to name a few. Did you know that these groups are represented by professional societies here at NSA? These "Learned Organizations" allow members of each profession to share information, recognize outstanding achievements in their field, and interact with peers.
(U) It's time for our annual round-up of Learned Orgs of interest to those working in SID. We'll highlight several such associations in the coming days. Watch for it!
