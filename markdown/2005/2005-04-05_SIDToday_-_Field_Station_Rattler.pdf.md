## (U) Field Station Rattler

FROM: CW5 Wally Price SIGINT Director Special Assistant Run Date: 04/05/2005
(C) On 1 April, the SID team with MG Quirk traveled to the International Zone, which is an area of Baghdad formerly known as the Green Zone. This area of the city has a great concentration of US personnel as well as other high-level organizations and representatives of Iraq and other nations. It is a key sector of the city, and has been identified by the CJSOTF-AP as an important locus in the battle with the insurgency.
(C) While there, we visited the embassy, and met with several high-level officials, including Ambassador Jeffrey, the Baghdad Chief of Station, Brigadier General Kett, British Army and Deputy C2 for MNFI, and Brig Gen Select Allston, USAF, Deputy Chief of Staff STRATCOM. These gentlemen are all enthusiastic customers of SIGINT analysis and reporting, and passed along their impressions of the issues of greatest importance for national decision-makers and for progress in the democratization of Iraq, many of which have been shared with you in notes from MG Quirk and others on this trip. Suffice it to say that their interest and concerns focus on defeating the insurgency and improving security, personified by the hunt for Abu Musab al Zarqawi.
(S//SI) We also had the opportunity to meet and talk with teams from Data Acquisition, FAD, and RAD, all of whom are engaged in work to improve the SIGINT system in Iraq, and to help build a competent domestic Iraqi SIGINT organization. In the afternoon, we left the relatively plush surroundings of the embassy and environs to meet with another, perhaps somewhat less flashy, element of the global SIGINT system.
(U//FOUO) Headquartered at a building dubbed the "No Heads Palace" (so-named because it had been framed by four huge busts of Saddam Hussein, all destroyed), the 4th Brigade Combat Team (4 BCT) of the 3d Infantry Division is tasked with patrolling and defending the International Zone, and defeating elements of the insurgency encountered in its AO (Area of Operations).
(S) Arriving at the "No Heads Palace," the team found itself huffing and puffing climbing eight flights of dusty, cracked marble stairs in full "battle rattle" (helmet, body armor and weapons). Coming up to a SCIF'd area at the top of the building, we entered the world of a tactical SIGINT site. Outside the site, someone has scrawled the title "Field Station Rattler."
(S) 4 BCT is an example of the Army's modular "Unit of Action" that it is trying to develop while fighting a war. It is one of four brigades controlled by 3d Infantry Division. The brigade is served by a SIGINT platoon led by the 3d Infantry Division. The platoon operates a PROPHET HAMMER system with ONE ROOF server, and target high-powered cordless phone (HPCP) targets in their local area, as well as GSM targets forwarded to their unit's ONE ROOF server. The platoon has six Arabic linguist operators-collectors, all

TSSI/TK-cleared soldiers, so they have the ability to shift effort from HPCP, to GSM, or to whatever other target they need to work.
(S//SI) Thanks to DIRNSA's tactical initiatives, the platoon has NSANet connectivity, and operates in concert with counterparts at COBRA FOCUS/GRSOC. One of the linguists told me that they routinely seek assistance from Fort Gordon when they get a cut of traffic that is difficult but they believe to be important. Also, they receive some support from the CST integrated at 3d Infantry Division.
(S//SI) The SIGINT platoon has two analysts who have attended GEO Bootcamp, and should have access to the "big six" national databases, but unfortunately do not yet have them. It seems there are some matters in their "Annex P" process that have yet to be completed before the access will be turned on. In the meantime, they are definitely feeling the problem of not having access to those databases. Without that, they are unable to do effective target development on handsets of interest for their AO. They try to do some tasking based on "lead" information they derive from local HUMINT reports, "pocket litter," and confiscated handsets.
(U//FOUO) The soldiers of 4 BCT SIGINT platoon do manage to provide some local area situational awareness, and they prepare a periodic summary of activity for the Brigade Commander and the S2 (Intelligence Officer). They do this after sanitizing all activity to the SECRET level.
(S) The SIGINTers are operating under very austere conditions; their SCIF is hot, dusty, and has few accessories beyond a couple of laptops, some hard copy working aids, and a few maps. But it is apparent that they are performing their mission as effectively and professionally as they can. On the small white board over the OIC's desk, there is a bullet under a task list that reminds them to complete the "USSID 18 download" for their local training. It is evident that they are able to maintain their adherance to all the appropriate policies and guidance because they are "plugged in" to the global network, and maintain contact and dialogue with some of their counterparts in CONUS. We take away from our visit the tasker to help them learn about all the organizations and activities in CONUS with which they can partner, and to whom they can turn for support.
(S//SI) At last, as we all circle out on the roof top for a series of group shots with our team and theirs, one of the soldiers relates to MG Quirk how the SIGINT Director had visited them in the 3d ID in Kuwait before the invasion of Iraq. The sergeant told MG Quirk that he had given them an inspiring speech about their mission, and how they would be breaking new ground in the targets they would be pursuing in the coming battle (encrypted voice, frequency hoppers, etc). He says it was a speech they all remembered. Now they are back in Iraq, this time fighting a counter-insurgency war, and again breaking new ground against the personal communications that are the medium of their new foes.
(S) We leave them, having tried to remind them that they are part of a wider, global team. But as we all scramble back down the eight flights of stairs, and load back into our armored transport, we privately have to admit our admiration for those young SIGINTers manning "Field Station Rattler" and defending the International Zone of Baghdad.
