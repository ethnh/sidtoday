(TS//SI) On 6 December 2004, senior representatives from NSA, NRO (the National Reconnaissance Office) and Mission Partners convened in Denver to celebrate the completion of a 5-year effort to centralize Overhead mission planning and execution at the site. The occasion was marked by a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new Overhead operations control center (named GLASSHOUSE) and by the final meeting of the IOSA* Senior Steering Group (SSG) that led the centralization effort.
(S//SI) Since 1999, NSA and the NRO have been working on a Ground Merged Architecture (GMA) for the Overhead Collection Management Center (OCMC) and the high altitude components of the SIGINT Mission Ground Stations. GMA allows the high altitude satellites to interoperate across missions and field sites. As part of this endeavor, NSA, NRO, and our Mission Partners agreed to centralize all processors and constellation mission planning and execution capabilities at the ground stations.
(TS//SI) At the December meeting, SSG principals from NSA, NRO and the Mission Partners were joined by MajGen James Armor, NRO's Director of Signals Intelligence Systems Acquisition and Operations Directorate, and MG Richard Quirk, NSA's Signals Intelligence Director, along with 40 others in Denver and via telephone conference at NSA, NRO and overseas field sites.

(S//SI) To start the day's events, MG Quirk and MajGen Armor cut the ceremonial ribbon in the IOSA Global GLASSHOUSE with assistance from Mission Partners. The opening of this new Operations Control Center marked the centralization of overhead mission management -including both Mission Planning, Scheduling and Assessment (MPSA) and Resource Management (RM) -- and the integration of more than 100 personnel in Denver, including civilians from NSA, NRO, Mission Partners, US military personnel and contractors.
(S//SI) Following an informative tour of the new GLASSHOUSE led by Major one of five IOSA Mission Directors, the SSG briefing began with opening remarks from Commander of the Denver site. Next, for the introduction and warm welcome to Denver before starting the agenda. The members reviewed the accomplishments of the last five years and discussed future directions. Following the SSG, everyone moved to the Denver Mission Planning "Vault" for a cake-cutting ceremony and refreshments.
