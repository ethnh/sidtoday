(U//FOUO) eBay? Wired Magazine? The Whole Earth Catalog? You may be familiar with them, but do you know how they are linked to the SID? Read on to discover the connection.
(U//FOUO) The Institute for Analysis is an exciting Advanced Analysis Lab (AAL)-sponsored activity designed to reach out to recognized industry experts to leverage previously untapped intellectual capital in developing new processes, methodologies, techniques and tools for our analytic community. (See the IFA webpage -- "go IFA" -- to learn more.)
(U//FOUO) Established in October 2004, the AAL selected Global Business Network (GBN), headquartered in Emeryville, California to manage the IFA. One of the interesting things that GBN has established for the IFA is a network of experts, the majority of whom have had no previous involvement with the intelligence community. These experts will work with GBN to apply strategies employed successfully in the competitive marketplace to challenges confronting NSA.
(U//FOUO) So what types of people belong to the IFA network of experts? Find out firsthand by attending a panel discussion on Human Networking, scheduled for 19 May 2005 at 12:15 p.m. in Friedman Auditorium. The panel will feature three members of the IFA network:

- Pierre Omidyar, founder and chair of eBay;
- Karen Stephenson, a leader in the field of network dynamics and president of NetForm International, and
- Kevin Kelly, author and one of the founders of Wired Magazine.

Stewart Brand, one of the co-founders of Global Business network and probably best known for The Whole Earth Catalog, will moderate the panel.
