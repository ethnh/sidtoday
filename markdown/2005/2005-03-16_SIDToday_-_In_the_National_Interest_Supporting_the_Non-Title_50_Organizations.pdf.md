Providing SIGINT to departments and agencies that are outside the Intelligence Community (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) The primary and traditional clients for SIGINT information are the organizations that make up the Intelligence Community (IC), especially the military components of the Defense Department. However, there are other Executive Branch organizations outside the IC -- called "non-Title 50 Agencies"** -- that also receive SIGINT products and services. These are nontraditional clients in the sense that their intelligence needs are driven by national policy issues and are usually more strategic than combat-support focused. However they can sometimes be tactical as well, as in the economic (trade) sense.

# (U//FOUO) What does the non-Title 50 organization/customer look like? 

(U//FOUO) Organizations identified as key non-Title 50 Agencies include Departmental entities such as the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Interior and Independent Agencies such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Communications Commission and the Joint Terrorist Tracking Task Forces. By their differing missions, they represent a very diverse client set for SIGINT support.

## (U//FOUO) How does NSA support non-Title 50 Agencies?

(TS//SI) Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, these non-Title 50 Agencies have gained added responsibilities to protect national interests and critical infrastructures as part of the Homeland Security effort -- and our intelligence support has increased accordingly. Some non-Title 50 organizations/customers have a history of using intelligence information, and interact with the IC routinely; others have very limited IC experience and must rely upon the external NSA Representative(s) or the Liaison Officer for SIGINT support.
(TS//SI) What make these customers interesting are their diverse intelligence interests. Terrorist-related activity, protection of critical infrastructures, bioterrorism, trade negotiations and economic issues, political leadership, energy, nuclear proliferation, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "Mad Cow Disease", Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), banking and financial institutions, alien smuggling, protecting U.S. monuments and landmarks are all topics that now fall within our national security interests.
(U//FOUO) The electronic delivery system in the client's workspace is INTELINK, where the customer can readily retrieve SIGINT product through the CT-Link or through dial-up to the ANCHORY database. SIGINT-On-Demand (SOD) is available through these systems. Our SID Representatives represent the other means of product delivery, providing the sensitive series or other compartmented information reports that are not available on INTELINK.
(U//FOUO) The number of clients reviewing SIGINT product differs with each organization and can vary from one, two, or three senior executive officials to about 40 individuals. Depending on the schedules of the clients, the SID Representatives meet with them daily, weekly or bi-weekly, or when situations requiring the customer's immediate attention arise. Non-Title 50 Agencies also receive an all-source Senior Executive Intelligence Brief (SEIB) Daily or the National Intelligence Daily in which SIGINT information is incorporated.
(U//FOUO) What has been the impact of SIGINT support to Non-Title 50 organizations?
(U//FOUO) From the customers' perspective, SIGINT "provides unique insight," "is very valuable reporting" and "is very helpful, making it easier for officials to accomplish their jobs." Customer success stories indicate that SIGINT has provided that needed foreign perspective, has assisted in countering positions opposing U.S. policy and helped to achieve successful outcomes in delicate negotiations with international counterparts.
(U//FOUO) As the use and reliance on SIGINT information increases, more requests are coming from these Agencies for SIGINT training, meetings with NSA analysts, and visits to NSA for Directorate level briefings and technical demonstrations. The customers are very open to information-sharing and are offering to work with NSA analysts collaboratively.
(U//FOUO) From the NSA perspective, support to these organizations is achieving the teaming, customer outreach, and information sharing goals as outlined in the NSA Strategic Plan and NSA Transformation 2.0 and the SID Customer Support Plan (CSP). The CSP has been a very useful tool to document the customer's strategic goals, the SIGINT intelligence information required to meet these goals, and actions that best satisfy these goals. The feedback coming from customers has been useful in determining what our SIGINT mission priorities should be and in steering analysis and production and realigning resources. Customer tip-off information has assisted in the analysis of collected information and has resulted in more responsive and timely reporting.
(U//FOUO) In supporting the non-Title 50 organizations, we expect that the client base will grow and that the demand for SIGINT products, services, and technologies will increase. As we forge new customer relationships and work together, we do so in the national interest.
**(U) Note:
(U//FOUO) So-called because the IC organizations operate in accordance with Title 50 US Code 413.
