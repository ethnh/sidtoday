(U//FOUO) The Language Center Chiefs: Developing Language Analysts for the Future

FROM:
Chief, South Asian Language Center (S209D1)
Run Date: $01 / 12 / 2005$
(U//FOUO) In response to world events -- including 9/11-- and to operational demands, NSA has greatly increased hiring of Language Analysts in recent years, which has reinvigorated the old Language Intern Program, now the Language Development Program. A most important step was the appointment of six permanent, full-time Language Center Chiefs in late March 2003.
(U//FOUO) The Language Center Chiefs, who are part of SID/Analysis and Production's Deployment Services (S209D), play an important role in the careers of all members of the Language Development Program, both new hires and experienced Language Analysts who have taken on the challenge of cross-training into a new language. All of the Language Center Chiefs are Language Analysts by trade, and they bring with them a wealth of experience at headquarters, downtown, and overseas.
(U//FOUO) The duties of the Language Center Chiefs include:

- Managing the development and deployment of new hires and cross-trainees, ensuring a logical sequence of tours, suited to individual skills and interests
- Working closely with a large number of Language Skill Community elements, such as the Senior Language Authority, the Language Analysis Skill Community Director, the Development Program Manager, Language Advisors, Language Sponsors, Language Training Representatives, Language Hiring Managers, the NCS language departments, and the Language Enhancement Program
- Cooperating, in addition, with the Deployment Services Language Account Manager, Product Line Account Managers, and Language Recruitment staff
- Providing a bridge between the Language Skill Community and the Product Lines, striving to balance development needs and mission priorities
(U//FOUO) The Language Development Program is the first part of a career-long Professional Health Program for language analysts. The Center Chiefs see their jobs as a payback to the skill community, and they work continually to develop new opportunities for the program members. In turn, the program members often craft their own tours and come up with creative approaches to this stage of their careers. Among our newest tours are external tours to RSOCs*, Second Parties, field sites, and downtown agencies.
(U//FOUO) What is a typical day like for a Language Center Chief? Well, a typical day probably doesn't exist, but it would include one-on-one meetings with center members, coordinating rotations with offices and language sponsors, talking with the program manager, attending an awards ceremony, reviewing resumes and P3s, and responding to questions of all sorts (from soup to nuts!) via email or phone. We have some additional duties, including liaison with SCS , heading the CLA 's Outreach in Language Education (OLE) program, and coordinating the Summer Language Program for college students. We'll also be involved in "2005: The Year of Languages," which is being celebrated throughout the U.S., under the auspices of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. This is an opportunity to focus attention on the benefits of studying other languages and cultures.
(U//FOUO) For the Language Center Chiefs, the opportunity to make a difference in the daily life and in the long-term careers of our many highly talented Language Analysts, soon to be the Agency's technical leaders, is what guides us. What is our one goal? It is laying a strong foundation for building a highly skilled, multi-talented language analysis workforce of the future.
