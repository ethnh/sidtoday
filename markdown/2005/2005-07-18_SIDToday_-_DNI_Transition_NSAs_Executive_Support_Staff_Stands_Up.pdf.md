This is a follow-up to the article What is the President's Daily Brief and How Does NSA Participate? (U//FOUO)

# Standing Up an Executive Support Staff at NSA (U//FOUO) 

(U//FOUO) Beginning on 5 July, the Strategic Intelligence Issues Office (S17) within the Customer Relationships Directorate stood up a new organization--NSA's Executive Support Staff (ESS). The ESS was created as part of the NSA's contribution to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) transition to increase and improve NSA's contribution to executive intelligence publications, including the President's Daily Brief (PDB), President's Terrorist Threat Report (PTTR) and Senior Executive Intelligence Bulletin (SEIB).
(U//FOUO) The ESS will be a small corporate team of senior intelligence analysts from both SID and JAD . The ESS will review, edit and coordinate items based upon SIGINT included in IC publications; develop NSA's ability to draft original items; and enable NSA to play a greater collaborative role at the national level. The ESS will be assisted by NSOC during non-duty hours in expediting timely responses to executive support requests.
(U//FOUO) In setting goals for the new Executive Support Staff, we hope to move quickly from a supporting/coordination role on community intelligence articles to a more active role in drafting original NSA articles. We are pleased to announce that the Leadership Team for the Executive Support Staff has been named and includes Patrick Bomgardner as Chief, as a Technical Director and as Senior Editor. A wiring diagram and brief description of positions in the new ESS organization are available.

## Providing NSA Representatives to the DNI PDB Production Staff (U//FOUO)

(U//FOUO) To facilitate our new, more active role in executive intelligence support, NSA will also be providing a senior intelligence analyst as the first NSA PDB Editor/Briefer and an NSA member of the PDB Production Staff. We have been working closely with Steve Kaplan, Chief of the President's Analytic Support Staff, to bring about these changes, allowing NSA to adopt a higher profile for intelligence support at the national level.
(U//FOUO) has been selected as our first NSA senior intelligence analyst to become an editor/briefer on the President's Analytic Support Staff. This opportunity affords and NSA a rare chance to directly impact policy-making at the highest level.
(U//FOUO) The second NSA position, also an 18-24 month assignment, will be for an Executive Officer/Liaison Officer on the PDB Production Staff. This individual will act as NSA's DNI Production Officer, serving on an interagency team and coordinating NSA's input to the PDB, handling PDB feedback to NSA and helping to create a collection posture database. currently serving as a CT Watch Officer, has been selected for the Executive Officer position and will move to his new assignment by early fall.
(U//FOUO) Both NSAers will work directly for Steve Kaplan and will also work closely with the new NSA Executive Support Staff in CRD . For the near-term the PDB Support Staff will remain at CIA, with possible relocation at some point to the DNI's new location.

Are you ready to become a part of the DNI Transition and take advantage of a unique opportunity to join the NSA Executive Support Staff? (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) CRD is also looking for a small number of Intelligence Analysts with editorial experience who would be interested in joining the NSA Executive Support Staff on a rotational assignment. If you are interested in finding out more about opportunities on the NSA Executive Support Staff, please contact ESS Chief, Patrick Bomgardner, or David Shore or Marilyn Maines of the Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17) Leadership Team.
