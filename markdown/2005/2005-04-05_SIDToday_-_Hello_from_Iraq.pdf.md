# (U) Hello from Iraq! 

FROM: Cindy Farkus
Assistant Deputy Director, Analysis \& Production (S2)
Run Date: 04/05/2005
(S) Cindy Farkus here, on travel with MG Quirk and a group of NSA/CSS leaders. The team includes Charles Berlin, Dave Hurry, Chief Wally Price and Our trip began Monday evening, 28 March 2005, with a couple of long commercial flights - arriving in Qatar on Tuesday night. After a little bit of confusion with my CAC card at the airport, I was finally allowed in country. We spent a short night at Camp AsSaliyah, talking with site personnel and resting for our flight to Baghdad on Wednesday morning.
(S) Following a hearty breakfast at the Dining Facility, we were driven to the airport, stopping at the "Grab and Go" on the way to ensure we didn't get too hungry enroute. We were issued weapons and were loaded into a C-130 for the 3-hour flight to Baghdad.
(S) During the flight we were able to view some of the countryside and take photos at the back of the plane with the cargo and U.S. flag. (We'll try and get some of those photos to you.) We donned our body armor and helmets and experienced a well-executed, spiral landing onto the runway at Baghdad International Airport. We were met by Ron Carback, NCR Iraq, and his deputy After a short, but rather bumpy ride, we arrived at Camp Victory and were shown to our quarters - in a place formerly used as a resort. Quite an ornate facility, to say the least! We had a fabulous lunch at Sport Arena DFAC - which offered everything from Mongolian BBQ, Mexican and Italian cuisine, salad bar, hot foods, to a myriad of desserts which included Baskin Robbins ice cream and milk shakes.
(S) After lunch we visited with the CST (Cryptologic Support Team) and had a chance to talk with folks about their experiences. We heard about what they do each and every day (there really aren't any weekends here - the days are very busy and go by very quickly). You could sense their excitement and satisfaction in fusing SIGINT with other "INT'S" to support current and planned operations. CST members ranged from very experienced military and civilian personnel to interns and junior enlisted as well as our second party partners. Personnel formerly assigned to the MOC were on duty and were eagerly putting the skills learned in the MOC to use in supporting coalition forces and a key customer set. The junior military personnel and civilian interns were effusive in describing their experiences and how much it had developed them professionally and personally. An Australian Warrant Officer was serving as the shift Battle Captain and, in his words - providing him with an unprecedented view of operations and situational awareness.
(U//FOUO) BG Yellen, Commander JIATF-FRE (Former Regime Elements) (Fwd) briefed our group on their organization, mission and successes. Ensuring all cogs in the production wheel are working in sync not just running at the same time is critical to the

efforts in the interdiction of key Former Regime Elements in, or transiting, Iraq. Next, we were briefed on TAREX and the Media Processing Center. There have been many successes for these elements, however, additional attention is needed on the role TAREX can play in the SIGINT Development world and in determining the extent of forward deployed media processing capabilities. There are opportunities to leverage the broader enterprise, to gain a better understanding of information needs, and to share knowledge and awareness from different perspectives.
(U//FOUO) One of the IAD representatives here gave us an overview of his role in providing cross-domain solutions that assist in information sharing. From the discussions, it was clear that he serves in both strategic and tactical roles in providing products and services. His ability to provide local support and technical expertise - and reach back to the enterprise - has enabled our forces to operate securely in a, coalition environment, using the best available technologies and services.
(U) Some of the key points made throughout the day:

- a need for tools and technologies to deal with volume, variety and velocity;
- training on and access to appropriate databases;
- constant and consistent communications and information sharing;
- the need for a common understanding of situational awareness and all perspectives;
- the real-world examples of offensive and defensive mission blending; and
- the need for policies and processes that support and enable a global, self-aware, self-synchronizing Cryptologic system.
(U) More to come - as our adventure continues!
