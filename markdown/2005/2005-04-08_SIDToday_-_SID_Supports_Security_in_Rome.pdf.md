(U) SID Supports Security in Rome

(U//FOUO) The death of Pope John Paul II has precipitated a series of high visibility public events, which will draw VIPs and millions of pilgrims from around the world making Rome an inviting terrorist target for the next few days.
(U//FOUO) Even if viewed only from the U.S. point of view, the next few days will be a security nightmare as an unprecedented number of American VIPs will be in Vatican City for the funeral: the current President and three former Presidents, all with their wives; the Secretary of State; the President's National Security Advisor; and a large Congressional contingent.
(S//SI) NSA will be providing SIGINT threat warning support to - not only U.S. Embassy and security officials in Rome - but also to our Italian SIGINT partners who are charged with providing support to the Italian security services ultimately responsible for the safety of the events. NSA is long experienced in providing this type of support to U.S. elements and our partners. What is relatively new in our experience is engaging all of our SIGINT partners to provide threat warning reporting to support multinational events. Similar to our experience during the 2004 Olympics, NSA has again engaged all of its foreign partners to forward threat warning reporting to NSA, which will then be shared with U.S. and Italian officials, as appropriate. AS234 (Telecommunications and Network Support to Deployed Operations) has put the finishing touches on software that will automatically pull partner reports related to this event and send them to the TERR desk in NSOC (NSA's point of contact) for further dissemination.
(S//SI) Additionally, the Center for Executive Protection (the CEP, S2I044) has worked with Counterterrorism's Operations Services branch to compile a comprehensive SIGINT support matrix which serves as a platform for "one-stop shopping" for information on the organizations involved in the Rome executive protection mission. The matrix includes information regarding target focus, operational comments/posture, and staffing and contact information, and is available upon request from CEP (DL cep1 or 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
