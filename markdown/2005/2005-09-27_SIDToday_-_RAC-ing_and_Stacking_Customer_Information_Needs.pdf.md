(U//FOUO) 'RAC'-ing and Stacking Customer Information Needs
FROM: $\square$ and $\square$
Requirements Analysis Center (S114)
Run Date: 09/27/2005
(U//FOUO) Talk about change! The Requirements Analysis Center, RAC (S114), is located in the Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD) and is part of the Customer Gateway Office. Our goal is to provide SID senior leadership, Issue Management Teams, SID organizations, as well as external customers, a pertinent analysis of customer information needs to support mission and resource decision-making. The RAC is constantly changing "our look" as we adapt to improve the products and services we offer to address our customer requests. Our current products and services include:
(U//FOUO) Decision Based Needs Assessments: This process is a work in progress whereby NSA gathers customer needs on a given issue, determines existing gaps in the SIGINT response to those needs, and devises a SIGINT Strategy to close those gaps, if possible.
(S) Key Reads: Key Reads are customer-driven needs tied to a specific, near-term (generally less than 72 hours) customer event, action, decision, or outcome for which the customer expects a cryptologic product or service. The RAC established the initial Key Reads process to support operational intelligence needs in Iraq and Afghanistan and continues to play a major role in expanding this process to other intelligence issues. For more information on Key Reads, please go to: Key Reads homepage and see the recent SID today article .
(U//FOUO) Information Need (IN) Performance Management Data: The RAC has established and documented a formal set of business rules for acquiring metrics data related to National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) Information Need satisfaction. The rules are used to generate metrics data to support the NSA Strategic Plan and by various SID organizations to generate production metrics based on IN response.
(U//FOUO) Intelligence Support Plan IN Mapping: Recently the RAC began to collaborate with Customer Gateway's Military Customer Account Management organization (S113) to work with the Combatant Commands. The RAC has begun to review selective Intelligence Support Plans (ISPs) to determine whether Information Needs exist that respond to the intelligence issues represented in the ISPs.
(U//FOUO) 2ND Party Reporting Analysis: As a result of the Customer Relationship Conference held in Canberra, Australia, in March 2005, the RAC is working with our 2nd party partners to review and evaluate selected 2nd Party reporting to determine what Information Needs they may be uniquely responding to, how strong the response is, and whether improvements can be made. Our partners are conducting similar evaluations of 1st party reporting that supports their customer needs.
(S) Information Needs (INs) Profiles and Evaluations: The RAC analyzes the SIGINT INs levied via the NSRP and provides a variety of products and services that categorizes the IN make-up of a specific Geographic Target (Iran) and/or a Topic (Terrorism). These products and services include:

- Basic IN Profile: Snapshot of NSRP data by country and/or topic. These reports are a unique product in that they are also posted to INTELINK. These reports can be found at:

Statistical IN Profile: Snapshot of NSRP data by country and/or topic with limited production statistics (primarily SIGINT serialized reporting from the PLUS Management Information System).

- Evaluation: Snapshot of NSRP data by country and/or topic with limited production
statistics and a qualitative review of the SIGINT response.
(S) The NSRP system is under constant flux as INs are updated, closed, or new ones added. At any given time, there are approximately 3000 Information Needs active in the system. Our reports often provide the only holistic view of the size and scope of intelligence issues against specific targets or topical issues, as well as the often-broad customer set who have either originated or have interest in the issues outlined in the INs. For some targets, there are hundreds of Information Needs levied by our customers. We have prepared reports that have reviewed all the INs associated with a target like Iran and that look at very specific issues such as the use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear weapons by terrorists.
(U//FOUO) Since its inception in October 2002, the RAC has grown from 2 to 34 analysts and continues to grow. We have issued over 130 formal reports and a large number of smaller "quick-response" reports. Customer requests for our products and services continue to grow. We have kept pace by developing standardized processes, improving analyst training and developing tools to facilitate data manipulation. Overall, we continue to receive positive feedback on our products and services.
(U//FOUO) The RAC also continues to look at new tools to improve the products and services it produces. Recently a new WEB based tool was procured that will provide a greatly improved search capability against NSRP data, allow the creation of standardized queries that will provide regular updates to Country and/or Topical IN profiles, and allow other organizations to stay current on these changes as they occur. Full implementation of this tool is expected by the end of 2005.
