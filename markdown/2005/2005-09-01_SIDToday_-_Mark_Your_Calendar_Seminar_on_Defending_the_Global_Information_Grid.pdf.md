(U//FOUO) Mark Your Calendar: Seminar on Defending the Global Information Grid
FROM: $\square$
SINIO for Information Operations (S17)
Run Date: 09/01/2005
(C) The Global Information Grid (GIG), the DOD's worldwide computer network, is threatened by hackers around the world on a constant basis. Most users who connect to the GIG are conducting legitimate business.
(C) Unfortunately, a small group of users are not legitimate and intend to harm the US through cyber exploitation of the GIG for criminal or foreign espionage purposes. The GIG exchanges billions of data packets daily and detecting cyber intruders is literally a needle-in-a-haystack problem.
(C) The responsibility of defending the GIG falls to USSTRATCOM and its cyber defense command, Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations (JTF-GNO). The JTF-GNO directs the operation and defense of the GIG to assure timely and secure net-centric capabilities in support of the DOD mission. This seminar will review some of the most persistent and damaging cyber intrusions against the GIG and will present the legal and technical issues associated with warning, detection, identification, and attribution of the cyber intruders. The seminar speaker will discuss NSA's unique contributions to JTF-GNO's current and proposed initiatives against cyber intrusions and will submit intrusion data that indicates certain intrusion sets could be state sponsored.
(U//FOUO) Mr. $\square$ is a senior intelligence analyst in JTF-GNO/J2 and will be discussing the challenges of defending the GIG from nefarious hackers while permitting the unhindered flow of information for legitimate purposes.
(U) The presentation will be held on 12 September 2005, from 1300-1500 in room 2B4118-6, OPS 2B.
(U) The classification level of this presentation is TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN and is open to all NSA badgeholders. No need to register -- just show up!
