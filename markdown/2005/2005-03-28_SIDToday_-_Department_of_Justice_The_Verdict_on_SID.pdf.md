(U) Department of Justice: The Verdict on SID

FROM:
DoJ Account Manager (S112)
Run Date: 03/28/2005

The Justice Department tells the truth (the whole truth, and nothing but) about how they view SID (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) SID recently pulsed senior customers at the Department of Justice (DoJ) to find out what they think about our products, services, and overall relationship. Last fall, the SID Account Management team held candid discussions ( SCORECARD interviews) with the Attorney General's point people for intelligence and crimes. Their personal feedback and well-informed insights are captured in the SID Customer Support Plan, and the resulting Action Plan is being shared with the Product Lines, Data Acquisition offices, and SID leadership (more below).
(U//FOUO) "Main Justice" serves as the headquarters element for national law enforcement components-such as FBI, DEA, ATF, U.S. Marshals, and U.S. Attorney offices -- and it provides legal policy counsel to Executive Branch offices. Our SID relationship is primarily with the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) and the Criminal Division . OIPR plays an intelligence oversight role according to Executive Order No. 12333, "United States Intelligence Activities." It is also a consumer of SIGINT, which provides valuable background for FISA* applications and for legal advice to the White House on national security matters.
(U//FOUO) The Criminal Division, on the other hand, more closely resembles a traditional SID customer. It uses SIGINT as lead information to guide investigations and influence national policy on:

- Terrorism
- Espionage
- Narcotics
- Organized Crime \& Alien Smuggling
- Other International Crime Activity: Weapons Proliferation \& WMD, Computer Crime, Money Laundering, Sanctions Violations, War Crimes, etc.

SID typically coordinates DoJ issues and interactions with NSA's Office of General Counsel (OGC).

# (U) DoJ's Ruling: Great Job, Keep Improving 

(C) OIPR and the Criminal Division are very satisfied with current SID support (rated 4.5 out of possible 5.0) and commended SID personnel on their responsiveness and exceptional, often sole-source, products. As these organizations respond to global realities and Attorney General requirements -- and since SIGINT comprises the bulk of their intelligence information -- they see the following opportunities to enhance our missions through partnership. SID Customer Gateway (S11) is ambitiously coordinating the associated actions with NSA stakeholders:

Understand Each Other's Business:

- Educate the A\&P workforce about the role of SIGINT in DoJ to better focus the SIGINT system; update DoJ personnel on A\&P missions and initiatives
- Establish frequent exchanges and senior-level visits

Produce Powerful Reports:

- Expand the use of Write-to-Release (WTR) and tearline formats -- DOJ raved about such
reports as the most "actionable" and "user-friendly"

- Enhance summary reporting for terrorism: include social network analysis in graphic form, background information for context, and drill-down capability for details

Focus on Emerging Threats Now:

- Organized crime and failed governments
- WMD, Proliferation, Alien Smuggling, Narcotics, Illicit Finance -- the convergence of terrorism with other crime networks, and abetted by foreign governments -- raises their threat to homeland security.
