(S//SI) How Does Your Target Use the Internet? A New Tool Can Help You Find Out

FROM:
NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC)
Run Date: 08/29/2005
(S//SI) Do you manually research your targets using the Internet? How confident are you that you have a complete and up-to-date picture of how your target accesses the Internet? Are you aware that there is a new tool that can help speed those tasks, providing a more complete picture of your target's Internet access as well as Autonomous System (AS-to-AS) connectivity?
(S//SI) DNOC Spiral II is a cutting-edge tool that merges open source, commercial, and SIGINT data to provide a daily model of the internet as well as incorporating change-detection at multiple levels of detail, provided by NTOC's Autonomous System Modeling and Change Detection organization (V11).
(S//SI) NTOC V11 philosophy:
Provide the SIGINT community, in a rapid and efficient manner, the best possible information describing targeted-data networks.

Find, develop, and utilize any source that can help us achieve our above mission statement.
(S//SI) Current capabilities:

- Consistent, daily import of open source \& SIGINT data
- Customer interface to enable AS-level network analysis
- Supports exploration of data networks over time: daily AS-level network models stored for 30 days
- Provides initial change detection capability: automated checks of new data against targeted data networks
- Begins to overlay SIGINT collection points on the logical AS level network map: To improve the efficiency of our collection assets get the desired info at the right place the first time
- Begins development of AS level IP-IP paths
(S//SI) Possible uses:
- Find new inbound and outbound links for a network.
- Find new paths of data that were previously hidden from open source research.
- Steer SIGINT towards links with higher intelligence potential, optimizing collection resources.
- Track target movement at the country level.
- Map DNI (Digital Network Intelligence) communication paths between targets.
- Accelerate the process of identifying changes in a target's network.
(S//SI) Future developments to allow for "drill-down" ability within AS of interest.
