(S//SI) NSA and Norwegians Meet for NORUSA 2005
FROM:
CDO Norway (DP11)
Run Date: 06/13/2005
(S//SI) NSA and the Norwegian Intelligence Service (NIS) conducted its annual policy conference, NORUSA, from 5-7 April 2005. The Director, Technical Collection Division (TCD), Tom Rykken (DIRNSA equivalent), and all of his Subdivision Directors for Regional Analysis, International Analysis, Collection, and Technology and Programmes, attended the visit, along with the Kirkenes Site Chief and an All-Source analyst from the NIS Assessments Division. This was the first time that an individual from the Assessments Division (the major customer for the Technical Collection Division) attended and she was an active participant and briefer in the Office of Russia discussions. The discussions were lively and the conference deemed a resounding success.
(S//SI) One highlight of the conference was a decision to begin, in earnest, cooperation on Russian civil targets. This decision followed on the heels of the 1 March visit by MG Hagen, Director General NIS, and Tom Rykken, wherein DIRNSA provided the partner with a Russia posture paper that identified our strengths and weaknesses on the Russia target. Much of the first day of the NORUSA focused on the Russia target, with briefings on the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Oil and Gas Developments, Leadership, and Strategic Highlights form the Northern Region.
(S//SI) Support to Military Operations was the primary focus on the morning of the second day, with discussions on mechanisms to support Norwegian Special Operations Forces deploying to Afghanistan and the summer two-year deployment to Kosovo. The conference also focused on transnational issues (primarily Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation) and SIGINT Development, with agreement to use the newly formed SIGDEV Working Group as an instrument for furthering our FORNSAT cooperation as VICTORY GARDEN moves from a purely technical program to an operational one with its December 2005 initial operating capability.
(S//SI) A series of discussions was held to review all of the major technical programs underway for HF, UHF/VHF/SHF, ELINT/FISINT, PROFORMA, and FORNSAT. The Norwegians are very concerned about the need for investment in the Barhaug site as they take a holistic approach to the work they do in East Finnmark in Northern Norway; they believe the lack of investment there will affect the entire region and their entire collection posture.
(S//SI) The conference was very fruitful and positive. We explored several new areas for cooperation, which were viewed positively. The Norwegians were told by the Principal Director for Foreign Affairs, Gary Grantham, that we would be asking them to do many things, some of which they might find difficult to satisfy, but that they should push back when it is too much and be given the tools needed to help satisfy our requests if they are able to help.
