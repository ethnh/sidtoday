(U) Leaders of NSA, NGA, and NRO Meet for First Tri-lateral

FROM:
NRO Account Manager (S112)
Run Date: 05/16/2005
(U//FOUO) For some time, NSA has held bi-lateral leadership summits with Community Partners such as NGA, NRO and DIA* to review and discuss issues of mutual interest. The goal has been to hold these bi-lateral meetings quarterly. As the Community has become more tightly knit, the Directors of NGA, NRO, and NSA have recognized the desirability and necessity of a joint trilateral summit meeting to discuss issues of joint interest to all three agencies. The first trilateral summit was hosted by NGA on February 22 at NGA, Bethesda. This location was chosen due to its location halfway between NSA and NRO.
(U//FOUO) Following a private Director's Courtesy Call, a wide range of topics were presented and discussed. These include

- NGA-NSA Future Collaboration Efforts,
- Payload I,
- OCMC-Source Integration,
- NRO Horizontal Integration,
- Long Range Scenario Planning,
- MORPHEUS Combined Architecture, and
- Denver Project Study.

Each of these topics offers the opportunity to enhance collaboration, interoperability, or Horizontal Integration in support of improved processes for production of intelligence.
(U//FOUO) The Directors agreed that this had been a very useful session and at its closure, expressed their desire to continue them on a regular basis. Bi-lateral meetings will still be scheduled as needed, but these new tri-lateral meetings are key to the collaboration and cooperation that's now become the near hallmark of the American Intelligence Community.
