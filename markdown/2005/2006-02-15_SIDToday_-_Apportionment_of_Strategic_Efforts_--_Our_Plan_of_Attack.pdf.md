(U//FOUO) Now that we've described how NSA's missions are selected... and we've let you know that the process to monitor their success is in place... we're ready to introduce the next step in the Governance framework. That step - Mission Apportionment - is the process whereby the U.S. SIGINT System (USSS) decides where it will concentrate its efforts.
(U//FOUO) Mission Apportionment, also called the Apportionment Decision, refers to the grouping of focus areas according to the percentage of USSS resources that have been dedicated to them. Apportionment is discussed during the monthly Mission
Discernment process (Governance Responsibility \#1). As a result, changes in the make-up of each group, or bin, may occur as missions dictate. However, because these changes are strategic, they may not impact the workforce immediately.
(S//SI) The following reflects the percentage of USSS resources currently dedicated to the corresponding focus areas (see slide 8 in the Gearing Up For Governance briefing):

- Bin 1: 35\% of USSS resources are dedicated to the Global War on Terrorism -- including Counterterrorism, Homeland Security and aspects of Countering Proliferation, Crime and Narcotics, Information Operations, and other missions.
- Bin 2: 35\% of USSS resources cover four enduring targets : China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia.
- Bin 3: 20\% of USSS resources are aimed toward optimizing efforts in the remaining strategic focus areas , while maintaining awareness of -- and surge capabilities against -- other targets.
- Bin 4: 10\% of USSS resources are set aside for development in the areas of Data Acquisition, Signals Development, or Analysis and Production. This bin affords Site Commanders and Cryptologic Center Chiefs the opportunity to operate outside their usual parameters, using their special skill sets to develop other target areas or provide local support to the Combatant Commander.
(U//FOUO) Watch this space for more on Governance!
