(U) If meeting the customer's stated requirements on-time and within cost is important to the success of your project, there is a process and a tool that can help.
(U) OK, so you say that you are feeling overwhelmed? Dreading the thought of adding yet another "process" to your already lengthy "To Do" list? So you ask yourself, "Why is Risk Management important?"
(U) All projects have risks; they come with the territory. Ignoring risks all but guarantees failure to meet time, budget or performance measures. By applying the Risk Management Process, you will be able to manage the project risks in a manner that will mitigate the potential adverse impacts on the project.
(U) Risks may present themselves in any number of ways including: schedule slippages caused by non-delivery of a crucial component, cost overruns caused by the unanticipated increase in the scope of the project, or performance problems when a component part does not meet expected tolerances during testing. Risks can also be environmental: the developed capability is to be deployed to a ship, under adverse weather conditions, or to a combat zone. While surprises add interest to our personal lives, they have no place in a well-managed project.
(U) Good project and program managers (PMs) and risk managers (RMs) plan early for risk management. The Risk Management Process includes three major activities: Risk Planning, Risk Assessment and Risk Resolution as shown in Figure 1 below. A detailed explanation of each activity in the process, with templates to make your job easier can be found on the Risk Management Process webpage. Risk Facilitators assist PMs and RMs by using the RiskNav tool to monitor project/program risks identified during risk management planning.

(U//FOUO) RiskNav was identified as the tool-of-choice in 2002 after a comparison study of six risk management products. It is the only Risk Management tool currently on the NSA/CSS Enterprise Solutions (NES) Baseline. RiskNav has more than 450 registered users, with 120 in SIGINT, and is used for programs managed by the Program Executive Office (PEO), programs in the Information Technology Directorate as well as those in the SIGINT Directorate. The PEO Risk Management Board, Enterprise Software Engineering Services and the SIGINT Systems Engineering Office actively endorse it.
(U)//FOUO) RiskNav is a web-based tool accessed from the SIGINT Systems Engineering Office (SSEO) Risk Management web page that allows facilitators, RMs and PMs to view information online and to print project risk reports. RiskNav provides formatted screens for facilitators and RMs to enter information about risks, document risk assessments, perform risk analysis and justification, estimate potential impact, determine probability, document handling strategy plans, and monitor and evaluate mitigation actions. The tool prioritizes risks based on the users' input. The current version 5.0, released 30 March 2005, allows each project to control access to its own risk data and provides enhanced management reporting capabilities.
(U//FOUO) The SSEO serves as the ombudsman for risk management across the Enterprise, providing process definition, procedures, templates, risk management training, a help desk, as well as RiskNav. In addition, organizations have Risk Facilitators who coordinate with Risk
Managers for all of the projects in their organizations. A detailed explanation of the various risk management roles can be found on the Risk Management Process webpage.
