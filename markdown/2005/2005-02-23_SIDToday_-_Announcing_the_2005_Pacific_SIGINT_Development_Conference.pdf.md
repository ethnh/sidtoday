FROM: $\square$
GCHQ Integree, SIGINT Development Strategy \& Governance (SSG) Run Date: 02/23/2005
(U//FOUO) Planning is currently underway for the second Pacific SIGINT Development Conference to be hosted by Kunia Regional Security Operations Center (KRSOC) from 19 to 21 April 2005.
(C) (C) The conference will focus on SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) in the Pacific and will explore how Mission Alignment will affect that community, as well as examine orchestration and collaboration across the Pacific SIGDEV community and between the Pacific-theater and NSAW and Second Party partners.
(C) At last year's conference there was a healthy mix of Extended Enterprise representatives and an NSAW contingent, as well as Second Party representatives from DSD and GCSB. This year we are hoping to have representation from all Extended Enterprise SIGDEV elements in the region, all Second Party Partners and increased participation from across SID and beyond.
(C//SI) The conference itself will consist of a series of briefings at TS//SI//REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR and NZL or below level from S2 Product Lines and Second Party partners as mission owners, S3 participants as capability/solution providers, and Extended Enterprise elements highlighting their SIGDEV successes over the past 12 months, as well as outlining their capabilities and gaps. The briefings are not only intended to facilitate the exchange of information, but to encourage discussions that will result in improvements to the SIGDEV mission in the coming years.
(U//FOUO) If you feel that your organization would benefit from active participation in this conference then please contact one of the following:
