New structure will improve communication with internal and external customers. (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) Driven by the need to better position the CSRC to serve as the "front door" for Data Acquisition (DA) and to communicate more effectively to external and internal customers, the CSRC has realigned key functions and talent into new offices that reflect the CSRC's growing responsibility, authority, and impact within NSAW and across the global enterprise.
(S//SI) Paralleling the Mission Alignment activities occurring Enterprise-wide, the Office of Partnership and Enterprise Management (S3C1) has assumed the new responsibilities of governing worldwide CSRC functions and established credible engagement with our Intelligence Community partners on Collection Management and Targeting. S3C1 also maintains its familiar role of leveraging the access, collection and technical capabilities of our Second Party partners and serving as the DA portal for all data flowing between NSA and a sensitive Third Party partner.
(S//SI) A cross-section of talented and experienced professionals grouped around portfolios of key issues (e.g., Counter-Proliferation, Latin America) comprises the new Office of Collection Initiatives and Strategies (S3C2) . S3C2's core role is to manage and coordinate collection activities, ensuring that Data Acquisition actions are optimally tasked and arrayed to answer the nation's collection requirements. This configuration also sparks collegial and creative approaches to developing cross-access collection initiatives and strategies.
(U//FOUO) The Office of Targeting and Mission Management (S3C3) directs the end-to-end management and governance of Data Acquisition Mission Management services for NSA throughout the Enterprise. Its ability to perform that role has been enhanced by the integration of the "old" Targeting and Compliance branch.
(U//FOUO) An entirely new office has been added to the CSRC, the Office of Strategic Access Issues (S3C4) . This new office addresses major gaps and shortfalls in SIGINT access and collection capabilities, and works with other organizations to find solutions and opportunities to "big picture" issues.
(U//FOUO) The NSOC Senior Collection Officers ( SCOs ), responsible for the 24/7 monitoring of the collection posture of the United States Collection Systems (USCS), as well as the expanded Tech Team have been realigned directly under CSRC senior leadership. The Tech Team is focused on modernization and automation of collection management, targeting, and Mission Management tools and procedures.
(U) In addition, the CSRC has been moving forward in the deployment of personnel and capabilities to the various Cryptologic Centers, having identified the leads for NSA/CSS Georgia and Colorado and the CSRC Europe facilities. To learn more about this initiative and other important changes, we encourage you to visit our website (go CSRC) and take a virtual tour of the new CSRC.
