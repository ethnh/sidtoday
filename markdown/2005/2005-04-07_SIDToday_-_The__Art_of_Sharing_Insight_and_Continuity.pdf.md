(U) The Art of Sharing: Insight and Continuity

(C) As you may know, MG Quirk and the crew are visiting our outstanding SIGINTers and customers out in the field. As of 2 April, we have visited Iraq and will move on to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the next few days. I'd like to share with you a key understanding we got from a customer engagement here in Iraq.
(U//FOUO) BG John DeFreitas is the senior military intelligence officer in Baghdad. We met with him in his headquarters located in one of Saddam's old palaces. It was quite a contrast to see the workman-like operations center set up in the ornately decorated, marble halls of the "Perfume Palace". After the usual briefing covering his mission and requirements, BG DeFreitas leaned back and gave us the good stuff (there is no substitute for meeting a customer face to face in his own space).
(U//FOUO) He explained that his intelligence problem was very, very complex and constantly changing and the operational paradigm is shifting from "US led" to "Iraqi led". He readily admitted that he did not have a monopoly on understanding the situation or the way ahead. He implored us to consider a special kind of sharing which he called insight. Our customers are learning to ask for more than sharing data - they want us to share our conclusions, our suspicions and our hypotheses - our insight . Naturally, they want it labeled as such but they are expecting us to go beyond SIGINT fact, even beyond SIGINT assessments to predictive intelligence. Yes, BG DeFreitas knows we are a single "INT", but he is a sophisticated user of our service and has realized that the global SIGINT system is made up of thinking people and he wants to mine that knowledge base. He is open to all thoughtful conclusions that you have. Don't just share data; share yourself. Find a way to do that in a chat session, a VTC, a product report or even a simple phone call. You can make a difference when you put your brain online.
(U//FOUO) Continuity is a second concept that BG DeFreitas feels is critical to success. He told us that there is a lot of turn-over out here in the combat zone and even back home in the CONUS. BG DeFreitas is concerned about the impact of a lack of continuity on his mission. Clearly, he appreciates that one of the things the global SIGINT system brings to the fight is target depth and expertise. He wants to be assured that this important attribute does not atrophy or stumble - he's counting on it. What can you do to help assure continuity? Well, if you are working the Iraq problem consider volunteering for a deployment out here to get close to the customer and the target. Capture what you know in a database, a report or a pass-on book. Participate in the various VTC and chat rooms where this mission is being discussed. It's all right to lurk for a while but eventually you will have to marshal your courage and put out an idea and let your peers review it and criticize it. It may be a bit painful at first but you will be happy when you see beyond the apparent criticism to see the value-added that comes with the application of multiple brains to an idea. One impediment to sharing yourself encountered by the responsible analyst is the hesitancy to act for fear of being wrong. Our credibility is important to our brand and we want our customers to know they can bet their lives on our products and services. But taken to the extreme this can result in analysis-paralysis waiting for the $100 \%$ solution to appear (it never does, by the way). One of our important customers is telling us he is ready to hear our emerging thoughts, especially if they advance the state of discourse on the subject. If you have maintained continuity on the target, your insight will be important to share even if it is at the $50 \%$ level. Get the discussion going with your analysis and keep it going with your insight.
(U//FOUO) As the global SIGINT system transforms to a truly net-centric organism, we need to learn the behaviors that we humans need to exhibit in this new environment. We have been given a big hint in so many words from one of our most sophisticated and engaged customers
that we must change from our transactional relationship (you send in your requirements and we'll send you some reports) to an intimate relationship where we really talk and, in the talking, come to a mutual conclusion. This way of behaving is intensely human and is more art than science. It is not the realm of fact alone - it is the realm of the meaning of the facts. Our customers need to know so much more than the what they need to know the so what.
