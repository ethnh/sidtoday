(U//FOUO) Do you need to know where specific Allied units are deployed worldwide with the click of a mouse? Do you need information on specific military operations at your fingertips?
(U//FOUO) The Blue Force Cell (S1311) obtains U.S. and Coalition information and displays it for use by SIGINT analysts and decision-makers. This Blue Force information includes topics such as Operations Orders, Situation Reports, and Service Briefings. We gather data that is dispersed across different networks and often times not even available via the NSA web. For example, we obtain Operation Orders and Situation Reports that are primarily located on the SIPRnet, a system not widely available in the agency. We also mine information from JWICS, NIPRnet, NSAnet and via direct communications with subject matter experts.
(U//FOUO) So how can you access this information? -- by setting up an account on the Blue Force Webpage . There you can quickly identify the Who, What, When, Where, and How of Blue Force activities in your area of interest. If the webpage doesn't have what you need, the Blue Force cell may be able to create and distribute products uniquely tailored for your purposes.
(S) In November of 2004, we established a webpage on NSAnet specifically to support Operation PHANTOM FURY, providing timely tactical information to SIGINT analysts directly involved. This is one example of the valuable support we can provide.
(U//FOUO) Set up an account today to access the Blue Force Webpage ("go blueforce" on your browser). Users in the field can create new Blue Force Webpage accounts 24 hours a day with the aid of NSOC Military Support Officers.
