(U//FOUO) METALION: A New PINWALE Search Engine for the Metadata Analyst

(C) Have you heard about the new PINWALE search engine called META LION ("meta-lion")? META LION supports the Agency's emerging metadata analysis strategy by allowing analysts to more smartly search against the large, rich repository of metadata associated with DNI (digital network intelligence) intercept. This search engine was introduced in May with little fanfare; the following will fill you in on its purpose and capabilities.

META LION - A Precision Search Tool :
(C) Analysts use metadata (information associated with, but not including, content ) effectively in a variety of analytic activities -- such as target development, statistical analysis, and contact chaining -- to name just a few. Metadata is significantly easier to manipulate than raw text and is well suited for machine processing.
(C) Querying metadata via META LION allows the researcher to conduct a more precise search as compared to the performance of LIONHEART, the traditional PINWALE search tool. It does this by querying the indexed PINWALE DNI metadata archive ( 700 fields) directly-- rather than LIONHEART's search through the complete document (content and metadata) -- while still providing a link to the document for retrieval purposes. In other words, META LION searches a smaller, more structured, body of information. This search capability is enhanced by XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language) tagging and technologies.
(C) META LION should be used when only metadata needs to be queried. However, because metadata alone does not provide the analyst with a complete picture, LIONHEART is available for both content and metadata searches. In sum, the META LION search engine allows the analyst to:

- (U//FOUO) Quickly search the most recent (currently 13) months of PINWALE metadata;
- (U) Perform fielded queries on 20 metadata fields;
- (U//FOUO) Perform boolean searches on all 700 metadata fields with greater precision than can be obtained from LIONHEART; and
- (U) Return document text for viewing or follow-on processing.


# META LION Instruction : 

(U//FOUO) Search strategies can be quite different when querying metadata, as opposed to content, therefore some specialized instruction is recommended in order to effectively use this new tool. PINWALE offers several training opportunities for analysts who wish to learn more about META LION, as follows:

- (U//FOUO) Formal META LION instruction is now included within the NCS course TOOL3002, Improving Pinwale Queries. This course provides advanced training for all PINWALE search engines and is offered monthly on an open-seat basis.
- (U) A one-hour META LION training module suitable for inclusion in branch training activities.
- (U) Desk-side META LION training and assistance to individuals or small groups.
- (U) A short briefing on META LION capabilities.
- (U) META LION syntax and search strategies are covered in Volume II of the PINWALE Users Manual.
(C) The 700 metadata fields searchable in META LION are compliant with Agency metadata standards (CCDF 2.3 plus DIAMONDCHIP extensions). If target offices are interested, however, Technology Services/S21234 can concentrate development efforts toward moving to other
formats and metadata standards. To receive more information about META LION, request a manual, or schedule a training session, please contact PINWALE support at
