Something to read while sipping your morning beverage... (U)
(U//FOUO) People sometimes ask about SID today's readership. Numbers aren't everything, of course, but we do monitor the stats to see which topics appear to be of greatest interest. Here are some figures from last month (May):

- Unique visitors (i.e. how many different people accessed the page during the month): 17,654
- Total visits (a "visit" is defined as a session spent on the website accessing the articles or files contained in it): 114,609
- Average visits per SID today edition: 5,458
(U//FOUO) Keep in mind that people outside of SID sometimes read SID today too, so it's not possible to directly equate the stats with percentages of the SID population. SIGINTers in the field and others in NSA also tune in.
(U//FOUO) In case you were wondering, the most widely read article in May was the Redesign of A\&P piece with 13,756 visits.
(U) At the end of every SID today article you can find a link to a feedback page -- if you see an article you like (or don't), please tell us your views.
