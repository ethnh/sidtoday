(U) Appointment of a New NSA/CSS Senior Intelligence Authority

FROM: Carl Johnson
SID/Deputy Director for Analysis and Production (S2)
Run Date: 10/05/2005
(U) The vision for Analysis \& Production to be a global analytic enterprise has many key components. One of the most critical elements is the responsibility to develop the analytic workforce of the future. In order to deal with the volume, variety and velocity of data and the complexity of the targets facing us today and in the future, we must ensure our analytic workforce is provided with the right training, the right opportunities, the right tools, and the right technology to succeed.
(U//FOUO) Because of the importance of this to the corporate Analysis and Production efforts, Cindy Farkus has been appointed as the NSA/CSS Senior Intelligence Authority as of 1 October 2005. She will continue to execute her responsibilities as Assistant Deputy Director for Analysis and Production. Deborah Maklowski will serve as the Deputy Senior Intelligence Authority. Cindy will work closely with Deborah and the SIA staff in overseeing the hiring, training, and retention of the NSA/CSS Intelligence Analysis workforce.
(U//FOUO) This coincides with the creation of Associate Intelligence Authority (AIA) positions at the Cryptologic Centers (CC) in Georgia, Colorado, Texas, and Hawaii. NSA/CSS Georgia recently selected $\square$ to be their AIA; NSA/CSS Hawaii's AIA position will be advertised in October; and NSA/CSS Texas and Colorade will publish their AIA ads in the near future.
(U) Cindy, Deborah, and the SIA staff look forward to working together with all of you to ensure that the NSA/CSS Intelligence Analysis Skill Community remains a committed, well-prepared, and innovative force for cryptologic excellence. We value the engagement, thoughts, ideas, and support of intelligence analysts everywhere and of our many partners and enablers in this endeavor.
