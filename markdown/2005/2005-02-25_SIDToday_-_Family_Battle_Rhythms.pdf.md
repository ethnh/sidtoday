# (U) Family Battle Rhythms 

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director
Run Date: 02/25/2005

Work and family staying in sync -- event planned for 4 March (U)
(U) In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, General Hayden invited NSA families into the building to reassure them that their loved ones were safe when they came to work. That was the first Family Battle Rhythms evening. Since that time, Gen and Mrs. Hayden have hosted six more Family Battle Rhythms evenings, each with a different theme and a different purpose.
(U) On 4 March, Mrs. Quirk and I will co-host the seventh Family Battle Rhythms. The theme will be "Deployed in Place: Dealing with Mission and Family Challenges." This evening is meant to support those military and civilian personnel who are working long hours, are on shift schedules and/or are under a lot of stress due to their job. The evening's speakers will address how to maintain a healthy family life, how to support family members and where to find resources for the families of military and Agency employees. Activities for the children will be available throughout the evening, including pizza and drinks.
(U) I strongly encourage military and civilian members who are "deployed in place" to register for this event.
