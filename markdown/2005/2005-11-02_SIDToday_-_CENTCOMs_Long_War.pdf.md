(C) In the last two installments, we examined CENTCOM's requirements on the SIGINT system, and our response. Today's topic is CENTCOM's Long War - and what it will require of NSA/CSS.

## (U) Supporting the Long War

(S//REL) In March 2005, the Commander of CENTCOM, GEN John P. Abizaid, unveiled his plans to fight extremism and instability in the CENTCOM region (East Africa, Middle East, Levant, Central Asia) over the next few years in a presentation titled: "Bold Shift 2005: Posturing for the Long War." CENTCOM is preparing for US force reductions in the region, transitioning operations to partner nations and indigenous forces, and improving target development and intelligence fusion capabilities through better partnering with other US government agencies, coalition members, and regional governments.
(S//REL) The principles he laid out are:

- Use the indirect approach; help others help themselves.
- Avoid dependency syndrome: promote self-reliant partners.
- Remove perception of occupation: we have no designs on territories or resources.
- Enable moderates.
(S//SI//REL) The following summarizes part of CENTCOM's vision for the future, and shows expected impacts to NSA/CSS:

| Issue | Today | Tomorrow | Impact on NSA/CSS |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| US Mission <br> Set | US military lead across spectrum: Counterterrorism, Counter- Insurgency, detainee ops, etc. | US forces retain lead for counterterrorism and continue to enable indigenous forces | Will have to acquire new targets to cover issues that are transitioned out of US control. |
| US Force <br> Posture | Large, fixed, forward-deployed force. | Expeditionary: <br> Flexible, <br> responsive <br> forces; greatly <br> reduced presence | Continue to support expeditionary SIGINT operations. |

## SERIES: <br> (U) SID Support to CENTCOM

1. Meet the Central Command
2. Challenges - What Can You Do For the Nation?
3. CENTCOM's 'Long War'
|  |  | in theater <br> - Tactical Quick <br> Reaction Forces <br> - Operational reserve <br> - Strategic reach- <br> back (air, land, sea on Prepare To Deploy Order) | Become more flexible, agile, and responsive. <br> Make training cycle faster and more effective. |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Intel <br> Architecture | Hierarchical, responsive, intelligence pull. | Networked, anticipatory, intelligence push. | Participation in Joint Intelligence Operations Command/Center for Iraq - coming online in 2005. <br> Install robust, expandable, reconfigurable SIGINT network in the region that can reach the fighter. |
| US Basing | Numerous large bases. | Minimal bases that support expeditionary posture. | Create new SIGINT collection strategy to mitigate losses from base closures in Iraq, etc. SID has already done much of this work. |

(U//FOUO) In the coming years, SIGINT support to CENTCOM will change to fit CENTCOM's changing requirements. As ever, NSA/CSS will place priority on support to the warfighter and optimizing mission success. Throughout the SIGINT system, we will strive to anticipate CENTCOM's needs and ensure that we deliver the right information and capabilities to them, on time and in the right manner.
