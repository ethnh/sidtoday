Course Overview:
(U) President Bush has set an ambitious U.S. policy goal of introducing and spreading democracy throughout the Middle East. The groundwork for regional states to move forward is set in political and economic reform of corrupt governments and bankrupt systems. What are the prospects for a successful transition among cultures, peoples and states where traditional values are often at odds with good governance, accountability, and personal freedom? We will look at the challenges, including the aims and efforts of other major powers external to the region.
