(U// FOUO) Client Central -- The Place for Customer Relations Information

FROM: Charles H. Berlin III
SID's Deputy Director for Customer Relationships (S1)
Run Date: 12/19/2005
(U//FOUO) This week Grand Central Station will be buzzing with holiday shoppers and visitors. It is the place to be for transportation connections in the Big Apple. Similarly, SID's new website, Client Central, is the place to be for information on NSA clients - and it, too, may soon be buzzing with visitors.
(U//FOUO) Premiering today on NSA Net, Client Central will provide a window into our relationships with customers. It will showcase information about SID visits, highlights, and successes and will feature basic client profiles and a listing of client management teams - NCRs, CSGs, External Representatives, Account Managers, and SEAMs**. A query capability will enable users to retrieve data by keyword, client, or visitor name, and because Client Central is a direct interface to Gateway's Customer Relations Management (CRM) tool, the query results will be "live" - with data available as soon as it is entered by Account Managers or the SID visits team.
(U//FOUO) While Client Central 1.0 is a major step toward making customer relations data available across the corporation, is only the first step. Future versions will offer more information and enhanced features - including a data entry capability to allow anyone across the enterprise to document customer interaction. The goal is information sharing: to provide a corporate window into customer relations activities - and a service so useful that people will flock to it, just like Grand Central Station.
(U//FOUO) For more information on Client Central, contact @U//FOUO@CSG. (U) Notes:
NCRs = NSA/CSS Representatives
CSGs = Cryptologic Services Groups
SEAMs = Senior Executive Account Manager
