Getting what you need to know from the SID Mailbag (U)
(U) The SID Mailbag is the easiest, most efficient and reliable method to get the answers to your seemingly unanswerable questions. Or to the questions to which you have gotten six different answers. With SID Mailbag, you will get the answers from the people who actually know. Get the correct answers, not RUMINT or hearsay or what you heard from somebody who heard it from somebody else.
(U) The process goes like this: you write in a question to the SID Mailbag, accessing it from the lower corner of the SID Today page under "Workforce Outreach"/SID Mailbag/Submit Comments. SIGINT Communications will forward the question to the appropriate individual who can answer the question with authority. The turnaround time from question to answer is usually kept to one week, but some responses may take longer to track down.
(U) Answers are posted in the SID Mailbag, and the SID today page will reflect that the Mailbag has been updated with new information. Keep in mind that you have the option of submitting your questions anonymously, if you prefer -- simply omit your name and e-mail address. (But note that this anonymity feature makes it impossible for SIGINT Communications or the responder to ask you for clarification or details.)
(U) Keep in mind, too, that questions addressed to the SID Mailbag should pertain to SIGINT or to SID. While there are many other things that are of interest to the SID workforce, unless they are within SID's scope, the Mailbag will not be able to respond. On the Mailbag page, however, there is a list of contacts for questions that might relate to enabling organizations throughout the Agency. They would be in a better position to answer non-SID questions.
(U) So, next time you are wondering about a process, a procedure, a plan or a policy, get the "real deal" answers with SID Mailbag.
