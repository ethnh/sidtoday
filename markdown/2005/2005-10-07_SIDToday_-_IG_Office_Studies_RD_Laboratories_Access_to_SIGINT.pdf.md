FROM:
Assistant Inspector General (D11)
Run Date: 10/07/2005
(U//FOUO) The NSA Inspector General has announced a Special Study of Access to SIGINT by Research and Development Laboratories. The overall objectives of this study will be to determine whether selected research and development laboratories (military and civilian) that receive SIGINT have:

1. the proper authorization to receive SIGINT;
2. been providing guidance on how to properly handle and use SIGINT, and
3. adhered to the authority of E.O. 12333 and related directives regarding awareness, protections, and reporting of U.S. person information.
(U) This study may require interviews of SID employees and access to organizational records. During this study any SID employee, including military assignees and contractors, may meet with a member of the IG team to discuss concerns about the study or to raise fraud, mismanagement or waste issues on this topic. Anyone interested in communicating directly with the IG on this matter should contact Assistant Inspector General (AIG)
