Run Date: 07/22/2005
(U//FOUO) Good day to everyone! We are the SID Protocol team and we would like to share with you what protocol is and why it's necessary.
(U//FOUO) Of course, proper introductions are necessary before we can continue:

- Janet M. Greer is the team leader. She joined the Agency in February 2004.
- is an "old timer" as she started in the Agency in 1987. She is the resident protocol historian because she's been in protocol for 5 years.
- is a Protocol Officer who came to the Agency in April 2003. Prior to joining NSA she worked in protocol at Ft. Eustis, Virginia for 10 years.

(U//FOUO) The SID Protocol Team officially reports to the NSA/CSS Protocol office, but is forward-deployed to SID. The main mission of the team is to support and advise MG Quirk, Mr. Meals, and Ms. Vice on forms of ceremony and etiquette for local, state, international formal and informal events. These events include:

- presidential, congressional, government agencies, corporate, foreign, and domestic visits;
- retirement and promotion ceremonies;
- on-site and off-site conferences;
- open houses and socials.

If the SID suite delegates are unavailable and transfer their responsibilities to another manager, we still provide support. SID Protocol also gives guidance to anyone in SID who needs a protocol question answered.
(U) Now you may be wondering, "What use is protocol? Why such troublesome and weird rules?" The authors of The Complete Handbook of Diplomatic, Official and Social Usage have a good answer to this question:
"Any organization or society must, if it is to thrive, operate under certain rules if for no other reason than to prevent chaos. The same applies to relations between governments. It is necessary that contacts between nations be made according to universally accepted rules or customs and some form of planned organization. That is protocol."
(U) Still want to hear more about how protocol works? Sure you do -- and there will be more to come in upcoming SID today articles. If you have questions or concerns now about an event, email the team at DL SDS_PROTOCOL or or give us a call on We're here for you!
