(U//FOUO) New USSID: Who Can Access Raw SIGINT
FROM
SIGINT Policy (S02L1)
Run Date: 09/06/2005
(U//FOUO) Updated criteria in place for determining who is included in the "SIGINT production chain," and therefore eligible to access raw SIGINT.
(U//FOUO) SIGINT Authorities!? SIGINT Production Chain!? What difference does that make? Actually, it makes a lot of difference to people who want to access "raw" SIGINT databases. To find out what these things are, read the new United States Signals Intelligence Directive (USSID) CR1610, "SIGINT Production and Raw SIGINT Access," to find out if you are authorized access to raw SIGINT.
(U//FOUO) USSID CR1610, which was signed on 25 August 2005, prescribes the authorities for SIGINT mission delegation and incorporates the updated criteria for determining what elements and persons are considered United States SIGINT System (USSS) SIGINT production-chain personnel. Such personnel are eligible for access to USSS raw SIGINT as well as to SIGINT databases based upon assigned missions.
(U//FOUO) This USSID supersedes SID Management Directive 406, "SIGINT Production and Raw Traffic Access," and includes a new Annex B, which was developed to reflect the evolving database access process and depict the procedures and responsibilities that enable database accesses, especially for field elements. This document will be continuously updated as the process evolves. Take a look at this important USSID: USSID CR1610.
