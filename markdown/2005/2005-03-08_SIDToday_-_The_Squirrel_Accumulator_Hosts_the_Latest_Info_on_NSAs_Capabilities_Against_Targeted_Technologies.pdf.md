(S//SI) Would you like information on NSA's capabilities against a range of application-layer protocols? The Squirrel Accumulator serves as a "one-stop-shop" to provide you the answers. It is an electronic, on-line list of 184 application-layer protocols that were prioritized by A\&P (Analysis \& Production) and provided to Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES) for exploitation via SID's strategic metadata initiative.
(S//SI) The system allows analysts and developers from around the Agency to seek out information on NSA's current exploitation capabilities against these protocols. Resources include:

- Protocol analysis,
- Methods for tasking the SIGINT system,
- The current status of NSA's exploitation capabilities, and
- A "bulletin board-style" notes system where anyone in the SIGINT community (including 2nd-Parties) can post or read notes about a particular protocol.
