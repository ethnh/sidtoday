(U//FOUO) They say that "everyone has a book in him." But you could also say, "Everyone has a SID today article in him"! For example, you could: Tell everyone about the important project you are working on and how it will affect others... Describe an interesting TDY you made... Point out a problem and suggest ways to fix it... Tell a success story... If you have an idea for a story, use the "Submit an Item" box on the right-hand side of the SID today homepage. You may be happy you did.
