(S//SI) Targeting of an outwardly legitimate anti-US group pays off.
(S//SI) Sometimes, in the murky world of civil disobedience, it is difficult to distinguish the line between legitimate political action and terrorism. The Counterterrorism (CT) Product line is occasionally forced to make this distinction in its pursuit of legitimate terrorists, as it did over 3 years ago when it began targeting a little-known, Europe-based group called the Anti-Imperialist Camp (AIC).
(S//SI) The AIC and its supporters appeared on CT's radar because of the inflammatory antiU.S. rhetoric that they used in their frequent contacts with elements of another CT target: the Spanish terrorist group Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA). A cursory look at the AIC revealed a group that, while obviously nurturing an extreme dislike of the U.S. and its "imperialist" tendencies, chose to express that dislike through legitimate protests and demonstrations.
(S//SI) However, a closer look revealed a duplicitous organization that publicly espoused legitimate political action while privately it aided and abetted the Iraqi and Palestinian resistances, as well as numerous terrorist groups such as the ETA, the Turkish Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C), the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Lebanese Hizballah, and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), to name but a few.
(S//SI) The decision to target the AIC has paid numerous dividends. AIC communications have provided unique insights into the expansive network of extremists and terrorists with whom the AIC maintains contacts. These insights have led to:

- the arrest of a high-profile financier of the Iraqi resistance;
- the identification of a Jordanian extremist with extensive links to other extremists throughout the world;
- inroads into the networks of anarchists, anti-globalists, and anti-imperialists who have worked to disrupt the NATO Summit in Istanbul, the Athens Olympics, the Group of Eight (G-8) Summit in Gleneagles, and the Turin Olympics, among other venues;
- a front row seat to the birth of a new organization that calls itself the Resistant Arab People's Alliance; and
- the identification of a group that plans to coordinate simultaneous operations against U.S. bases worldwide.

Moreover, knowledge of the AIC and its connections apparently prompted a recent U.S. Government demarche to the Italian Government during which the U.S. Government demanded the arrest of individuals involved with the Italian wing of the AIC.
(S) In the case of the AIC, time and persistence have made it much easier to determine that the line between political action and terrorism has indeed been crossed.
