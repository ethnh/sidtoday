(TS//SI) A reader overseas wrote in to comment on the article "A Tough Targeting Challenge: Skype":

Comment:
(U) My feedback pertains especially to the following paragraph:
"(TS//SI) Target Collection: Skype uses peer-to-peer networking. This means that the packets from the same voice call will take different network paths to their destination. This requires multiple SIGINT collection sites to be able to recognize and collect packets from the same voice call. Skype also attempts to resolve latency issues in packet transmission, which means that, as much as possible, Skype packets will keep to fiber- optic and other types of land-based infrastructure for transmission purposes. As the Skype network and the global Internet grows, only limited amounts of Skype traffic will be available over traditional FORNSAT collection."
(S//SI) SCS (Special Collection Service) sites frequently see landlines and may have access to this traffic in certain situations. They are also more likely to have access to other VoIP systems (VONAGE, Packet8 etc) since any VoIP system is likely trying to avoid satellites, when possible, due to latency issues.
(S//SI) Another problem has to do with USSID-18 compliance. Anyone with any brains will buy their VONAGE, Packet8, Lingo etc. phone in the U.S. and register it with a U.S. number. These phones then work anywhere they are in the world with access to broadband internet. So even though I have been overseas for a long time, I have a U.S. phone number that rings in my home, in my hotel or wherever I am...and that location is not the U.S. When I call the U.S., my number will show up on caller ID as "City Registered- Wireless." There were similar problems prosecuting the Inmarsat targets in the mid 90's.
