(U//FOUO) Standardizing Our SIGAD/PDDG Naming Conventions
FROM:
SID/Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3)

The GOLDPOINT 2 database of standardized access names will make it easier to track the flow of data; application in budget affairs, as well. (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) I want to tell you about a recent initiative that highlights our commitment to streamlining processes within Data Acquisition. It is GOLDPOINT 2, a new database which will be used to update and maintain the NSA/CSS master list of SIGAD/PDDGs*.
(U//FOUO) GOLDPOINT 2 began as a way to create a standard for naming conventions that relate to our accesses, and manage those naming conventions across the SIGINT system. The primary goal is to better track what data is coming into the building, and from where. Further, it will establish a baseline of information that brings us closer to accomplishing the Agency-wide goal of integrating performance measurement and budget.
(TS//SI) To justify funding levels, it is critical to show how a given program has performed in the past or how it is expected to perform in the future. The new database will make it easier to connect all of our programs' performance with their corresponding budget lines. GOLDPOINT 2 will make it possible for all of SID to use the same program names. So, when Congress talks to DA about endpoint, DA will be able to show the program in its entirety and not have to pick endpoint-related projects out of several categories as we now do. The same holds true for the cable and RF programs. All offices need to be using and reporting on identical data using approved business rules.
(TS//SI) The following is the approved list of access type categories:

- RF
- CABLE
- ENDPOINT
- RF/ENDPOINT
- CABLE/ENDPOINT
- PROTECTED
(S//SI) The next step is to align all programs/projects into the following access detail :
- BLARNEY
- CLANSIG
- CLASSIC
- CES
- OTRAS
- CSG
- ENDPOINT
- FAIRVIEW
- FIXED ACTIVITIES
- RESERVE ACTIVITIES
- FORNSAT
- FORNSAT/ENDPOINT
- HARBORVIEW
- HF
- HFDF
- MIDPOINT RF
- MOBILE
- MORGAN
- NASP
- NATIONAL GUARD ACTIVITIES
- OAKSTAR
- RAMPART-A
- RAMPART-M
- RAMPART-T
- RESERVE ACTIVITIES
- SCS
- SCS/CLASSIC/ENDPOINT
- SCS/ENDPOINT
- STORMBREW
- TACTICAL
- THINGSGOLD
- TRYST
- VOICE
- DATA
- CLOSE ACCESS
(U//FOUO) Using these standard naming conventions will allow us to eliminate duplicative and erroneous program names, while maintaining a common set of program definitions.
(U//FOUO) The development of GOLDPOINT 2 was carried out by the DA Performance Management team, with significant help from the Customer Relationships Directorate and the Corporate Data Warehouse. For additional information on how GOLDPOINT 2 will be implemented and managed, please contact
