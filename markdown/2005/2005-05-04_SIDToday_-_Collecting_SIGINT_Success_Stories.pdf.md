# (U) Collecting SIGINT Success Stories 

FROM:
SIGINT Planning, Programming and Execution (S01X)
Run Date: 05/04/2005

Share your accomplishments with our customers, stakeholders and work force (U)
(U) Did you ever feel so proud of something you'd accomplished at work that you couldn't wait to tell someone? Have you already written a Success Story and briefed it to the A\&P showcase? Or maybe you have already provided a Success Story to leadership or NSOC etc.? If you answered YES to any of these questions here's an opportunity to let our customers, stakeholders and workforce know about it! Please forward your Success Story to us and have it showcased.
(U//FOUO) As a part of performance management, SO1X collects Success Stories from each of the Directorates and the Extended Enterprise. These stories are utilized in a variety of NSA reports that are distributed to our shareholders. SIGINT Planning, Programming, and Performance (SO1X) is responsible for overseeing the development and execution of the SIGINT Enterprise business goals and objectives.
(TS//SI) Success Stories are a great way to share your accomplishments. The stories can range from how NSA provided SIGINT during the Iraqi elections to how we assisted with security at the Pope's funeral. The stories showcase the end-results and impact of NSA's hard work.
(TS//SI) We utilize Success Stories in various publications, such as the Performance and Accountability Report (PAR), which is shown internally to leadership, as well as to, the Office of Management and Budget, Department of Defense, other Intelligence Agencies, second party partners and officials in Congress. Success Stories are also an integral part of the SIGINT Accomplishments Report, an internal report used to highlight the SIGINT Enterprise strategies and progress towards NSA Goals. In addition, Success Stories also appear in The Director's Budget Testimony.
(U) Ready to share your story? Just contact one of the POCs in the Directorates listed below. If you do not fall under any of the listed Directorates, submit your story directly to the S01X POC. Please, follow the submission directions below to ensure that your story is properly formatted for submission into NSA's documents. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
(U//FOUO) POCs:

- S1 Customer Relationships Directorate:
- S2 Analysis \& Production:
- S3 Data Acquisition:
- All other areas / S01X:


## (U) Formatting Directions:

1. SIGINT success stories should read like a short news clip--not too technical, easy for a non NSA employee to understand, exciting to read.
2. The text description of each success story should be 250 words or less.
3. Each story should include a POC name and phone number.
4. The accomplishment must have taken place during FY 2005 (although it may have spanned prior fiscal years, and only been completed in FY 2005).
5. Success stories should be written to a classification no higher than TS/COMINT/5 EYES.
6. Include graphics if at all possible. Electronic images should be of photo quality (density at 300 dpi , not interpolated up to 300 from a 72 dpi by the computer from a web page, for example). Hardcopy photographs are ideal and will be returned if required. JPG files are typically not useable for a printed document.
7. If the success story is related to an Agency Strategic Goal or Objective, please note the one that is most closely identified with the accomplishment.
8. If any names or clearly recognizable photos of individuals are used, a signed waiver should be included that allows the Agency to publish that individual's name and/or photograph.
