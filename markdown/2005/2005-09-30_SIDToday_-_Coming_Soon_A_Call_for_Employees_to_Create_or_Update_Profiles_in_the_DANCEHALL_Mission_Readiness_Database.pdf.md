(U//FOUO) Coming Soon: A Call for Employees to Create or Update Profiles in the DANCEHALL Mission Readiness Database

FROM:
Dancehall Team Lead (S01)
Run Date: 09/30/2005
(U//FOUO) DANCEHALL database has two separate functions: 1) to document employee skills and mission data and 2) to allow employees to see and apply for job vacancies
(U//FOUO) In October, all employees in the following organizations...

- S2 (SID/Analysis and Production)
- S17 (SID/Strategic Intelligence Issues)
- S01 (SID/Integrated Planning)
- all of the Cryptologic Centers (formerly known as RSOCs)
...will be asked to create or update their profile in the DANCEHALL database. Specific information and guidance will be forthcoming soon on this effort, but for now, here's an explanation of what DANCEHALL is all about:
(U//FOUO) NSA has thousands of analysts engaged in the pursuit of Signals Intelligence and Information Assurance missions. How do we document these activities and ensure that analysts are deployed against missions in a way that is consistent with national priorities and maximizes limited resources? One mechanism is DANCEHALL, the multifaceted project that helps SID organizations to account for all civilian and military personnel performing cryptologic missions throughout the global enterprise. Still developing, DANCEHALL is a relational database by which individuals 1) document their skills and mission data and 2) query and/or apply for job vacancies. It also allows managers to optimize staffing as missions and priorities change, identify tools and training that may be needed, and understand current analytic resource deployments.
(U//FOUO) DANCEHALL provides these capabilities in two ways. The first is through the analyst profile tool that allows you to document in the DANCEHALL database your cryptologic skills and knowledge, and the missions that you are working. Once entered, your individual profile is saved and must be updated whenever you change jobs, assume a new mission, acquire a new skill, or feel you have significantly increased your proficiency in one of these areas.
(U//FOUO) The data in the DANCEHALL database help to inform internal mission management decisions as well as respond to external queries from Congress and the Intelligence Community on mission readiness and resource allocation. Because the data is used in this way, and to make sure that training needs and resource gaps are correctly identified, it is essential that you document your profile accurately. Please note that you will not be subjected to an involuntary directed assignment solely on the basis of the skills information provided.
(U//FOUO) One of the most influential activities that DANCEHALL supports is the DDNI/A* Analytic Resource Catalog (ARC), an Intelligence Community (IC) database of analysts, their missions, skills, knowledge, and abilities. Analysts throughout the IC are required to update their individual profiles every six months and this data is forwarded to the ARC. This semiannual mandatory event is scheduled to begin again on 1 October. NSA will forward data contained in DANCEHALL to fulfill this requirement--stay tuned for further instructions.
(U//FOUO) Another (separate) feature provided by DANCEHALL is the capability to view and apply for advertised positions. DANCEHALL is used by civilians and military, analysts and managers, throughout SID and is the backbone database for the NSA/CSS Deployment Center. Through the CVA application, you can scan the vacancies, market your skills, and volunteer online for missions to which you can contribute. If you are looking for an exciting challenge,
