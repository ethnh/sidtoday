(U//FOUO) The NSA Collection Association (CA) has not ridden off into the sunset, as some believe, but is still kicking and breathing, although it is labored breathing. The CA has been around for over 27 years, serving NSA collection and associated interests by providing Community-wide recognition and unique opportunities for professional growth. It is not ready to give up the fight.
(U//FOUO) Through the years, the CA membership has played a key role in the many successes of many NSA employees at one point or another in their career. They tend to care strongly about the collection field and work everyday to continue to learn, improve, research, manage, and understand the changing signals environment. They also work to pass on to the next generation the knowledge that only comes from years of experience, to assist the future collectors in upholding the high standards of the collection field.
(U//FOUO) Although the CA may not be as large as it was in the past, it still has members willing to put in the extra effort to maintain the many awards created to recognize collectors developed by the CA membership. This year with the assistance of the Director of the Professional Health Program Skill Community for Collection, and some die-hard CA members, as well as others, the CA has been able to continue with the awards created to honor those individuals the CA considers the backbone of the SIGINT community.
