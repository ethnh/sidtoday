Hungarian SIGINT'ers invited to write reports for dissemination through NSA (S//SI)
(S//SI) During his recent visit to Hungary, the Assistant Director of Foreign Affairs for SID Operations, delivered a letter from NSA's SIGINT Director to the Director-General of the Hungarian Military Intelligence Office (MIO). This letter praised the quality of MIO analysis and reporting and invited the MIO to work with NSA as part of our extended SIGINT enterprise. With a goal of equipping MIO analysts to write SIGINT reports for dissemination through the NSA system to our Intelligence Community customers, the SIGINT Director offered reporting seminars to our Hungarian partner.
(S//SI) Over the past 18 months, two tailored reporting courses have been conducted for MIO, in order to familiarize MIO with NSA's reporting style and how it is driven by our customers' Intelligence Needs. Based on considerable strides in MIO reporting after those courses, an intermediate-level course on NSA reporting format will be conducted this month.
(S//SI) In addition to providing unique access to Serbian and Ukrainian military targets, MIO has been instrumental in providing intelligence that answers high-priority CIA and DIA requirements that NSA would otherwise not be able to answer due to manpower constraints. Engaging foreign partners on initiatives such as this will leverage our partners' language, target, and analytic expertise to help fill some of the gaps left by personnel reassignments and mission reductions.
