## About the IAI...

(U//FOUO) The IAI has been reaching out to the workforce for over 30 years, presenting to the NSA workforce a variety of distinguished speakers from government, industry, and academia. The IAI is a member of NSA's Council of Learned Organizations and its aim is to promote an interest in international events and affairs while providing unique insights into those issues. In addition to the essay contest, the IAI pursues its mission through the following activities:

The International Challenge : Open to all NSA employees, the annual International Challenge is an unclassifed written contest which consists of 100 multiple-choice questions on the following topics: international and domestic affairs, politics, economics, history, current events, the military, and geography. Cash prizes are awarded to the participants achieving the top three scores.

Speaker Series : One of the IAI's highest priorities is to arrange for speakers to address the NSA workforce on matters of current international interest. Recent speakers have included:

- Ms. Theresa Loar, Vice President for Global Strategies at CH2M Hill and former adviser to First Lady Hillary Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, speaking on " Gender and Security "
- Dr. Lawrence Korb, Senior Fellow, Center for American Progress and former USD(Manpower, Facilities and Resources), speaking on " A New Security Strategy in an Age of Terrorists, Tyrants, and Weapons of Mass Destruction "
