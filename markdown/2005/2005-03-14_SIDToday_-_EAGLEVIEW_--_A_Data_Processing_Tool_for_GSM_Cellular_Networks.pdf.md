(U//FOUO) EAGLEVIEW -- A Data Processing Tool for GSM Cellular Networks

(TS//SI) The Target Knowledge Branch (S32233) would like to introduce EAGLEVIEW, a tool that is supporting the global war on terrorism by helping DoD analysts map terrorist GSM* cellular telephone networks. EAGLEVIEW plays the vital role of processing raw GSM survey data files from front-end collection devices (called NEMO or PILOTHOUSE, and TETLEY). Its output and report files can then be processed by the BELLVIEW tool to display cell coverage areas, and by the ORMS/CELLFINDER application to geolocate Base Transceiver Station (BTS) locations.

# Background: 

(TS//SI) EAGLEVIEW's predecessor, originally called the PILOTHOUSE Preprocessor, was created in 2002. Prior to that, the raw PILOTHOUSE data had been imported directly into BELLVIEW, a process that typically took several hours. Using the PILOTHOUSE Preprocessor not only significantly reduced the time required to import data into BELLVIEW, but also produced richer and error-corrected output files.
(TS//SI) However, several things changed during the past two years. First, the PILOTHOUSE data format was updated for the changing GSM environment, and neither BELLVIEW nor the PILOTHOUSE Preprocessor had the capability to process the data. Second, terrorists began switching from Thuraya to GSM phones - making GSM one of our highest priority targets. EAGLEVIEW, an enhanced version of the PILOTHOUSE Preprocessor, was created in response to these critical issues.

## Examples:

(TS//SI) The image below shows EAGLEVIEW output that has been processed by BELLVIEW. The polygons represent the cell coverage areas identified by EAGLEVIEW.
(TS//SI) The following image shows a portion of a cellular network (i.e., towers and cells) that was processed using EAGLEVIEW and calculated using ORMS/CELLFINDER; the results are displayed in BELLVIEW.
