DISTANTFOCUS pod is new system for tactical SIGINT and precision geolocation... first deployed in December (S)
(U//FOUO) What resembles "LITTLE BOY" (one of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan during World War II) and as LITTLE BOY did, represents the dawn of a new era (at least in SIGINT and precision geolocation)?
(S) If you answered a pod mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is currently flying missions in support of the Global War on Terrorism, you would be correct.

(S) DISTANTFOCUS is a new capability that allows remote operators situated in the Headquarter's building at NSAW to dynamically tune receivers and receive both real time audio as well as geolocation information. The operators are members of the Air Force's 94th Intelligence Squadron.
(S) DISTANTFOCUS development has been a combined effort of SID's Office of Target Reconnaissance and Survey (OTRS, S316) and a cleared small business contractor located in Linthicum Heights, Maryland. Additionally, a partnership with NASA Goddard Greenbelt was established for altitude testing to ensure operational success at 24,000 feet. The system is one of four that are being built as a quick reaction capability to enable tactical exploitation of signals as well as providing precision geolocation results so that appropriate action can be taken.
(TS//SI) DISTANTFOCUS uses commercial off-the-shelf receivers and direction-finding hardware and software on a single UAV to provide our tactical customers with real-time intercept and location information. The system is contained within a six-foot long pod that is 16 inches in diameter. The pod mounts on a PREDATOR'S UAV HELLFIRE pylon wing and weighs 136 pounds. DISTANTFOCUS receivers cover the 2 MHz - 3 GHZ frequency range and offers varying geolocation precision -- at the low frequency ranges it is accurate within 500 meters and at higher frequencies under 100 meters. DISTANTFOCUS has been flying in the CENTCOM AOR* since December 5, 2004 and quickly generated 1 product report, and over 76 KLIEGLIGHTs and 25 geos.
(TS//SI) Part of DISTANTFOCUS's success has been based on another OTRS effort, the AIRHANDLER communications link between the PREDATOR and NSAW. This link utilizes a portion of the PREDATOR's video bandwidth, encrypts it and sends command and control as well as voice data from the PREDATOR back to NSAW and GRSOC. The Information Assurance Directorate provided tactical encryption which enables the link to be secure, yet will have minimal impact if the equipment is captured.
