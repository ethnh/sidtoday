(S) On 5 November 2005 (0600EST/1100Z), the Counterterrorism Mission Management Center (CT MMC) began 24/7 operations to synchronize SIGINT support to the global war on terrorism (GWOT) and to ensure global CT situational awareness.
(S) The CT Watch Officer (CTWO) and NSOC TERR Desk ceased operations on that day -- their functions now fall within the purview of the CT MMC, Operations Support Division.

(S//SI) CT MMC 24/7 Operations is staffed by a team including a Senior CT Operations Leader, Operations Officer, Intelligence Officer and Executive Officer, each of whom serves a critical function evaluating intelligence and operational priorities, and ultimately presenting a global CT SIGINT perspective. This "one-stop-shop" for CT SIGINT support significantly enhances our decision-making capability and our responsiveness to worldwide CT operations. The CT MMC will begin daily production of "CT Today," which is intended to provide greater insights into operational issues, target operations and CT SIGINT priorities.
(S//SI) This endeavor requires collaboration and communication -- we fully expect to actively engage all parts of the CT SIGINT enterprise to accomplish our mission. CT MMC Operations will lead Global Synchronization Meetings each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday with broad participation. Essential to the success of this effort will be the direct participation of the Cryptologic Centers and other field elements that play key roles in prosecuting terrorist targets. Synchronizing SIGINT's contributions to the Global War on Terrorism cannot be accomplished alone, therefore we encourage and, in fact, expect frequent communication.
