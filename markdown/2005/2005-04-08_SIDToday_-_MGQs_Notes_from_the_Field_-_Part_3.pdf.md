(U) MGQ's Notes from the Field - Part 3

(U//FOUO) Hello from somewhere over the Arabian Peninsula. I'm writing this third installment to our trip report from the flight deck of a C-130H Hercules transport aircraft departing from Qatar on our way to Kabul Afghanistan. We have completed our four-day stay in Iraq, but I will use today's letter to catch you up on what we learned there.
(U) You may remember that I left off with the missions and requirements of the Ambassador and those of the MNFI and MNCI. I'll continue in this vein today. Fortunately, I have a 6-hour flight ahead for doing some writing.
(S//SI) On 1 April, our team visited the British Brigadier Bob Kett, who is the MNFI Deputy C2. He deals daily and personally with Iraqi governmental leaders, and is charged with standing up the Iraqi Intelligence Community. He loves our product; it provides him with great insight concerning the people he is working with. With his busy schedule he finds summaries especially valuable. He is particularly interested in emerging personalities in the Transfer of National Authorities (TNA), in the larger state of the Sunni insurgency, and Sunni engagement in governmental bodies, in illicit activities moving through or connected with Syria, and in projections of what will happen in the future internally as the Shi'a assume control of Iraq.
(S//SI) The Charge D'Affairs at the embassy in Baghdad spent a lot of time with us, and was very forthcoming with his needs. The first three priorities on his list were "Where is Zarqawi?", "Where is Zarqawi?" and "Where is Zarqawi?" He believes very strongly that getting Zarqawi off the streets is the next logical coup for the campaign. Zarqawi and his "mayhem R us" henchmen wield a very significant psychological force over the people of Iraq. He has proven to all that he will not hesitate to brutalize Muslims and that he has no real regard for the Iraqis. Zarqawi and his band are 7th century guys. They won't be assured by progress. They must be taken off the streets! Removing him from play will build enormous confidence and hope in the populace of Iraq. The Charge' points out that the balance has shifted in our favor in recent weeks. We (the force pushing toward democracy) are on a roll. "We are winning...but we haven't yet won-- a bad conjunction of events could mess it up." Those events could include: A bad government, eg with Barzani intentionally undermining democratic formations; the death of Sistani (Sistani is absolutely vital to stability; he always comes up with the right solutions, and always manages to convince all the players to adopt his solutions). Internationally, the Charge is satisfied with our coverage for the present, but points out that Syria is still a mystery to us. His goals here are to continue cracking down on the Syrians, and to keep the Iranians where they are. He points also to the Mideast Peace Process as a big player. What happens there always has a major influence over the Middle East, and specifically in progress in Iraq; so our efforts

in the Peace Process matter.
(S//SI) Back on the internal side, this time with the Kurds, he is very happy with our product on Talabni, "But Barzani is opaque." Understanding Barzani's position will be important. He places enormous emphasis on the reconstruction of Iraq's infrastructure, especially the restoration of electricity and gasoline to the people. We are up to about 12 hours of electricity now, and further increases are vital for commerce, industry, and quality of life. He challenged all of us here, stating he had yet to see a report on insurgency intentions to attack electric or gasoline delivery infrastructure. Finally, he pointed to the importance of the upcoming vote to adopt the constitution. He is not so much concerned that Sunnis would vote it down as that Sunnis would be intimidated to refrain from voting, and would like any indicators of such intimidation. As a parting remark, he and his political/military deputy praised our UN and diplomatic reporting--it has been extraordinarily valuable to the Embassy in all of their dealings. They were also very complimentary of our hostage/kidnapping coverage, stating that our tippers are particularly vital.
(S//SI) I have focused down on a few leaders in this letter, because I want all of you to see the dependency on, and high regard for, SIGINT that all key leaders here share. Everyone we interviewed had the same detailed sense of what we do now, and for what we might be doing the future. They praise us, not only for the quality of our product, but for our choice of targets, our direct and selfless support and other non-SIGINT actions, and most of all for our SIGINT representatives, providing them face-to-face services out forward. Each and every leader spoke strongly for their particular NCR, CSG, NIST, and CST cryptologists. They asked that we continue to send them such fine people, who have so easily become their trusted "battle buddies." Finally, each and every leader we met asked, in an almost sheepish way, that we just try to do even more, pointing out that each increase in our efforts had meant more soldiers saved, more enemies defeated, and more rapid progress toward our goals.
(S//SI) We must seek out ways to help more in the Global War. Each person we put to the task is like a hundred riflemen on our front lines. I doubt that SIGINT has ever enjoyed a position of more importance or acceptance throughout such a large population of supported agencies as it now does. We must not shrink from this opportunity now. I once served along side a regiment whose motto is "Who dares, wins." That must be our motto as we aggressively meet and exceed the expectations of our operational partners in this Global War on Terrorism. I ask that each of you seek out a fellow cryptologist who has returned from this region and ask them about the importance of our contribution and the value of increasing our efforts.
(U//FOUO) I'll leave you today with another unit motto: " Keep up the fires." It's the motto of an old artillery regiment. What we are doing today in missions around the world is providing fires support that is every bit as effective and important as artillery in history. So tonight, as our team flies on to Afghanistan, let me ask you to continue to pour it on.
