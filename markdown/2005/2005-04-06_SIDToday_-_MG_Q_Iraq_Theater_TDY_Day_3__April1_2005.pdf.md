(U) MG Q Iraq Theater TDY: Day 3, April1, 2005

FROM:
Iraq Issue Management Team
Run Date: 04/06/2005
(U) Sunrise over Baghdad. Eight months ago, if you had told me that I would be standing on the porch Sadaam's Al Faw Palace, witnessing a beautiful April First sunrise over Baghdad, I would have thought that you'd be pulling a world-class April Fool's day prank on me. But at 0705 this morning, that's exactly where I found myself. The sky was slightly hazy, the temperature was in the low 60 s, and the breeze was almost chilly. And yet, if it hadn't been for the pair of Black Hawks crossing the morning sky, and the vision of the bombed out shells of several previous Iraqi palaces, and the team of coalition Officers speaking jovially in a melodic Korean behind me, I just as easily could have been in Columbia Maryland.
(S) A Day of Firsts. I do not have a long history of TDYs to war zones. In fact, prior to 36 hours ago, the most hostile ground my feet had trod was the third-world sidestreets of Cancun, Mexico. And yet, in the course of a few months, the NSA Deployment Services team had coordinated training and education that resulted in my preparation for participation in a TDY to the Iraqi Theater with MG Quirk and a team of SID Seniors. And to top it all off, in the course of less than 24 hours:

- I flew in my first military aircraft (C-130 flight from Doha, Qatar to Baghdad, Iraq).
- I took my first flight in a rotary wing aircraft (Black Hawk flight from Camp Victory to the Baghdad International Zone)
- I stepped foot on a military camp in a war zone (Camp Victory, Camp Slayer)
- I talked with a US Ambassador (Ambassador Jeffrey)
- I met with a CIA Chief of Station (CoS Baghdad)
- I was briefed by tactical collectors at 4th Brigade, 3rd ID at the No Heads Palace, who were completely enthralled by the capability that the ONEROOF system provided them.

All in all, not a bad 24 hours.

## (U) Baghdad: More Than Just A Dot on the Media Map.

Skirting over the streets, parks, homes, and businesses of Baghdad this morning, I became strikingly aware of a fact not well presented on TV- Baghdad is a city. It is full of people. By far the vast majority of these people are not our enemies. I saw people driving to work, kids playing in the streets, and plastic lawn furniture on back porches - not so different than an overflight of any major city would reveal. Driving from presidential palace to presidential palace, many of them now becoming overrun and overgrown due to lack of care and nurture, one can only imagine the splendor of what this city may have looked like only a few years ago and more importantly what this city could look like in just a few years as democratic reform and the resultant national pride are realized in the beautification of this city.

(U//FOUO) SIGINT Excellence and Professionalism in The Iraq Theater. If you've ever wondered if our SIGINT contributions are making any difference in the campaign in Iraq, stop wondering. From Combatant Commanders, to US Ambassadors, to CIA Chiefs of Station, the message is remarkably consistent, and unquestionably complimentary. Quotes like the following became remarkably routine as we traveled around and met with in-theater SIGINT customers:

- "Your service is unparalleled..."
- "Truly Phenomenal..."
- "Dedicated people who truly make a difference..."
- "Overwhelming coverage. My single greatest source of intelligence."
- "Yours is a free-thinking organization. We get nothing but enthusiasm and support."
- "Your intelligence is timely and accurate. We seldom get surprised..."
- "The NSA Cryptologic Support Group (CSG) Baghdad Daily Read is the best intelligence document that we receive. The document is readable and concise - Spot On..."
(S) And as we visited with engineers, analysts, linguists, collectors and SIGINT professionals of every type and every experience level, it became clear that the common denominator amongst all of them is that they are a dedicated, highly-trained, and extremelymotivated workforce. Their love for their mission, and their expectation that their efforts will translate directly into a safe, stable, transformed Iraq are the key factors in the their extremely successful drive for excellence.
