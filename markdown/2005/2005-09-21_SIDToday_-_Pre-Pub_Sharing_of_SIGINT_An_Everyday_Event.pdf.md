(U//FOUO) A\&P encourages analysts to share SIGINT with Intelligence Community peers as part of analytic collaboration -- even before the SIGINT is published.
(U//FOUO) In the not-very-distant past, if you had asked someone, "How is SIGINT disseminated?" you would have received a simple answer: "Via a SIGINT report." The idea of sharing SIGINT outside the context of a formal report was almost unheard of! Of course, things are very different in the post-9/11 world. Analysts from NSA and other intelligence agencies now routinely collaborate and analyze SIGINT data before a report has been issued. In fact, this process of "disseminating for analytic collaboration" is not only authorized, but is now strongly encouraged, with a USSID in place to support it.
(U//FOUO) USSID CR1611(P), "SIGINT Dissemination for Analytic Collaboration" -- formerly numbered as USSID 323(P) -- clearly states that SIGINT analysts can collaborate using information that has been minimized for U.S./2nd Party identities and evaluated for foreign intelligence (without revealing sources and methods) prior to publishing a report. The collaborative analysis may lead to a report at a later time, but the sharing of SIGINT data at this stage is to find context and significance for the SIGINT. It is important to note here that the purpose of analytic collaboration is not to make the analysts' job easier by eliminating the need to do a SIGINT report, but rather to make for better SIGINT analysis.
(U//FOUO) The guidance established in USSID 1611(P) applies when SIGINT analysis could benefit significantly by collaborating analytically with the appropriate partner. We share that information in briefings, emails, discussions, phone calls, etc. Then we document the sharing in a Collaboration Record, a form found on A\&P's Information Sharing web page (go infoshare) that is very easy to use.
(U//FOUO) The A\&P Ops Staff strongly encourages all analysts to trust our partners and share freely within established guidelines for that relationship. We need to emphasize that the dissemination of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) data (both content and metadata) requires special handling. Be sure to consult the specific guidelines before sharing any FISAderived SIGINT information. (See FISA FAQ.)
(U) The analyst should work with the customer/partner to understand where best in the "SIGINT stream" information sharing can begin to achieve the required outcome. The analyst should then share success stories of how analytic collaboration improved both SIGINT reporting and that of our partners. A\&P is establishing an incentive awards program for information sharing, and will publish more information on this later.
(U) A link to the Collaboration Record is provided below, as is the link to USSID 1611(P). Should you have any questions, feel free to contact the A\&P Ops Staff at
