(U//FOUO) From ROADBED to EKB -- The Journey Continues
FROM:
FORNSAT Planning (S33121)
Run Date: 03/17/2005
(S//SI) This month, ROADBED, a 5-Eyes foreign satellite (FORNSAT) database, took another step forward in its transformation to NSA's corporate Environmental Knowledge Base (EKB). ROADBED currently contains metadata from the FORNSAT collection efforts of NSA and its 5Eyes partners (GCHQ, CSE, DSD, and GCSB). The EKB will eventually include FORNSAT, Cable, and Overhead data that can be used to holistically characterize the access environment and facilitate sharing of dynamic physical, signal, and logical information and metadata from collected signals. This enhanced signals environment characterization will permit more refined and effective access planning -- an ultimate corporate goal!
(S//SI) The first step in transforming ROADBED to the EKB was the development of a web-based prototype ( ) available to all NSA and Second Party users from August to December 2004. Successful testing of live data paved the way for EKB roll-out in March 2005. The webbased EKB has a three-tier java application with a user interface that even your grandmother could use. With an expanded set of data fields, a GOOGLE -like search engine, and web-based service, users no longer need to be tool experts to take advantage of a wealth of SIGINT information.
(S//SI) Inclusion of cable data represents the next step in achieving a corporate EKB solution. An April 2005 prototype will give selected NSA users the ability to view environmental data from eight special source operations' (SSO) sites, in addition to the FORNSAT data. Viewing SSO and FORNSAT data from a central interface will provide SIGINT customers with a unique opportunity to easily expand their field of view. The roll-in of Overhead data will begin in the fall of 2006: one-stop shopping for environmental data, from multiple accesses, is truly just around the corner! The ROADBED/EKB team, a Data Acquisition/Radio Frequency Operations and Analysis and Production/Production Services partnership, continues to work closely with SID Systems Engineering to make the EKB a relevant and true corporate solution.
