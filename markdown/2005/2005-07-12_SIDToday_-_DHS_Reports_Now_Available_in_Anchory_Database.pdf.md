(U//FOUO) DHS Reports Now Available in Anchory Database
FROM:
Account Manager for DHS (S112)
Run Date: 07/12/2005
(U//FOUO) The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) started the production of Intelligence Information Reports (IIRs) earlier this year. However, since no DHS database existed in ANCHORY, this reporting was going into the DoD database, where few, if any, SID personnel knew about it. Now that's changed! A new, separate DHS database in ANCHORY was activated on 7 June. It provides SID personnel with access to IIRs from the DHS/Office of Information Analysis (OIA), which includes Customs and Border Protection information, and from the U.S. Coast Guard. Check out the DHS1 database today!
(U//FOUO) In addition, the NCR* DHS, the NCR DHS Liaison to the DHS Office of Information Analysis, and the DHS Account Manager are providing one-hour information sessions throughout the summer for SID personnel who want to be better informed about the Department, its components (do you know which agencies/entities became part of DHS in March 2003???), its mission, its information needs, and much, much more.
(U//FOUO) If you would like to schedule an information session for your organization, please contact DHS Account Manager . In the meantime, you can access Homeland Security-related information and documents on the NCR DHS website ("go homeland-security").
(U//FOUO) Several courses are also available to provide NSA analysts with information on U.S. critical infrastructures. Three courses have already been presented, on maritime security, supply chain management, and transportation security. These courses will be refined and taught again in the upcoming fiscal year.
(U//FOUO) In August, a new course will be offered through the National Cryptologic School; the course will include:

- an introduction to critical infrastructure and critical infrastructure protection,
- an introduction to Homeland Security, and
- brief overviews of the water, public health, emergency services, defense industrial base, postal \& shipping and key-assets sectors, with an in-depth discussion of the food and agriculture and the chemical sectors.
(U//FOUO) For more information about the Homeland Security 101 series, please contact Deputy NCR DHS Patricia Newman (U) Notes:
