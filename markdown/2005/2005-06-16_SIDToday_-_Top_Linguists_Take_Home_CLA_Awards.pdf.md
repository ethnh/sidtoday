(U) Top Linguists Take Home CLA Awards

FROM:
Crypto-Linguistic Association
Run Date: 06/16/2005
((U)This month the Crypto-Linguistic Association (CLA) presented its five annual awards, four to honor outstanding language analysts, and one to honor dedication to CLA itself. The achievement awards are named after four giants in the field, and the CLA award is named for one of the organization's outstanding former presidents.
(U) Sydney Jaffe Award for long-term contributions to the cryptologic language mission by a civilian.
(U//FOUO) $\square$ Senior Language Authority, $\square$ and Anita Kulman,CLA President
(S//SI) $\square$ was presented with the Sydney Jaffe Award in recognition of a career marked by exceptional contributions as an Arabic linguist, analyst, trainer, mentor, and Middle East expert. He has served the SIGINT community focused on the Arab Middle East for nearly 30 years, in virtually every capacity, every arena, and every crisis where his unique combination of multiple dialects and in-depth analysis has been needed. He has long been widely recognized as NSA's preeminent Arabic voice language analyst for Arab military targets. Even before the watershed 1996 Al-Khobar Towers bombing in Riyadh, $\square$ had focused his language talents on Arab terrorism issues. As a result of his dedication, his gift of understanding even cryptic spoken Arabic, and his willingness to share his expertise:

- junior military linguists working Libyan targets in Athens were ready to provide critical intelligence on Libyan reactions to repeated U.S. operations;
- the U.S. Air Force used SIGINT he provided to minimize losses in 12 years of daily air patrols over the no-fly zones in Iraq; and
- certain Al-Qa'ida mujahedin once active in Yemen and Iraq have been eliminated and can no longer threaten the United States.
(U) Captain Joseph J. Rochefort Award for long-term contributions to the cryptologic language mission by a military language analyst.


# (U//FOUO) CTI1 

(S//SI) CTI1 (AW/NAC) $\square$ USN, won the Rochefort Award in recognition of her suberb career accomplishments as an Arabic language analyst in both the training and the operational realms. She has served in the field, as a Military Language Instructor at the Defense Language Institute, as an interpretor in a joint U.S.-Bahraini exercise, and as a translator on an international team supporting UN arms inspectors in Iraq. Later she flew hundreds of hours as an airborne intercept supervisor in hostile airspace, providing direct threat support to Operation Southern Watch aircraft over Iraq. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, $\square$ led 65 aircrewmen conducting combat reconnaissance operations to ensure the safety of coalition strike aircraft over Iraq. Despite near-constant enemy antiaircraft fire, she made key contributions to the detection and exploitation of tracking data on surface-to-air missile batteries deployed around Baghdad. Most recently $\square$ has excelled as the subject matter expert for Arabic cryptologic development, leading a team developing interactive webbased courseware.
(U) Norman Wild Award for mid-career contributions to the cryptologic language mission by a
# (U//FOUO) 

(S//SI) $\square$ winner of the Norman Wild Award, stands out as one of the few people in the U.S. Government who have both language skills (Sudanese Arabic) and deep, substantive area knowledge of Sudan. His fostering of customer relationships, mentoring of junior employees, and high productivity have significantly enhanced NSA's ability to support both diplomatic missions in a war-torn Sudan and SIGINT operations in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). He enabled NSA support to national-level policy-makers and negotiators associated with U.S. diplomatic efforts to end Sudan's civil war and monitor Sudan's counterterrorism compliance. The CIA and State Department often relied on $\square$ judgment and insights to gauge the Sudanese parties' flexibility at peace talks, their attitudes toward U.S. pressure, and their willingness to compromise. Despite these accomplishments, it is readily apparent that his work as a mentor and teacher to analysts at NSA and across the larger intelligence community will be his legacy. He consistently places greater value on ensuring NSA's capability to maintain and enhance mission than on self-promotion.
(U) Colonel Alva B. Lasswell Award for mid-career contributions to the cryptologic language mission by a military language analyst.

## (U//FOUO) $\square$

(S//SI) $\square$ USAF, received the Lasswell Award. His notable accomplishments and devotion to duty have put him at the forefront of the cryptologic community's exploitation of the Iraqi target and its support to both U.S. policy-makers and the warfighter. Prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom he worked numerous Iraqi missions, including the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS), telecommunications development, and the diplomatic/political target. He performed masterfully during Operation Iraqi Freedom, providing critical support to U.S./Coalition forces engaged in combat. Based on his outstanding performance, $\square$ was selected to lead the Iraqi High Value Targets/Force Protection Team, spearheading NSA's linguistic efforts to locate/capture Iraqi regime remnants while protecting U.S. forces in harm's way. He proved instrumental in the capture of several key Iraqi figures. $\square$ work has garnered praise from the highest levels of the U.S. government.
(U) The Harry L. Rashbaum Award for service to CLA.

## (U//FOUO) $\square$ (Mr. Rashbaum's grandson), Harry Rashbaum, and $\square$ was not present.)

(S) This year, there were two Rashbaum Award winners: $\square$ and $\square$ took on the challenge of creating a CLA Conversation Hour program at a time when there were groups in only two languages, Spanish and French. She investigated and cultivated interest in conversation in other languages, handling the publicity and coordination. Now CLA is sponsoring conversation hours in about 15 languages including Arabic, Chinese, German, Haitian Creole, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish and Urdu. (Information on these conversation hours is posted on the the at CLA web page $\square$ has been CLA's quintessential volunteer: whenever anything needs to be done, her hand is up first. She updates the CLA bulletin boards, often coming in before or after hours if she is in class or on other assignments outside of the main campus buildings. During National Hispanic Heritage Month, she worked on CLA's annual banquet, teaming with POCs from the Hispanic Forum and the Office of Diversity and Disability Affairs to organize CLA's first co-sponsored banquet.
