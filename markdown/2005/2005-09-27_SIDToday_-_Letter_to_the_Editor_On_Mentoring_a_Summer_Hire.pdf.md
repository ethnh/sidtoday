(U) Here's a letter about the recent article How I Spent MY Summer Vacation!

From:
( U//FOUO) Just wanted to say that as a member of the OCMC Orbit Shop and a very long-time member of the SIGINT team, it was a decided pleasure to work with and mentor a young vibrant summer hire such as Ms. $\square$ I can honestly say it has been a rare moment in my life when I was so impressed with a neophite's quick and accurate grasp of things highly technical and her ability to use her knowledge in a productive way. As an "older" citizen, I can take heart in the calibre of the youngsters coming into this vital work. Until I met Ms. that was not evident. A good summer for both of us.
