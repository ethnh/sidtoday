(TS//SI) In the wake of 9/11, SID has shared more SIGINT-related information with Intelligence Community partners than ever before -- more, in fact, than some ever thought possible. This has been especially true regarding SIGINT support to HUMINT operations. Here's a case in point: In late 2004, the CIA was conducting a major operation against individuals connected to Iran's covert weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program. The SID shop that supports HUMINT operations, S2D31, broke new ground in sharing information with CIA, with important results.
(TS//SI) NSA possessed audio files and verbatim transcripts of intercepted conversations between a high-priority HUMINT target and his close family relatives. The material was not only analyzed and reported, but also transmitted in raw form with accompanying analytic comments to CIA with the help of the Special Source Operations' Global Operations Management Division (S3323) and under the guidance of S1's SIGINT Post-Publication Services (S1213). This specially tailored product enabled CIA operatives to positively identify speakers, more effectively assess the mental state of its human assets (i.e. people providing CIA with information) and sub-assets, and advise these assets under conditions which, at times, were truly life-threatening.
(S//SI) In another information-sharing endeavor, five Russian linguists from the FBI visited CIHS (Counter Intelligence and HUMINT Support - S2D) in February 2005 to listen to intercept of a Russian communication system and the FBI linguists hoped to be able to identify the voices of the FBI and the general on this channel. Although the linguists were unable to confirm the identities of the FBI, they were able to use what they heard to rule out some suspected communicators. Additionally, they were able to confirm some of their observations about the
(U//FOUO) These two examples show how invaluable access to SIGINT -- once rarely shared outside SIGINT channels -- can be for agencies like the CIA and FBI. The S2 operations staff has recently streamlined and simplified the process for sharing information with external IC partners. Type "go infoshare" in your internal browser for more details.
