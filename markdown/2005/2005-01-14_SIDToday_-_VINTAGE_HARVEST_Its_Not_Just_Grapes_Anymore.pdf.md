(U) VINTAGE HARVEST, It's Not Just Grapes Anymore

(U) The first question you may ask yourself is "What is VINTAGE HARVEST?"
(U//FOUO) VINTAGE HARVEST is a worldwide web-based system linking a signal parametric database, signal reports and working aids, processing SCRYPTS, programs, and signal bit samples. VINTAGE HARVEST is the successor of the Signal Information Processing System (SIPS) M204 database. VINTAGE HARVEST is available via the NSANet and INTELINK. (See the homepage .)
(U//FOUO) VINTAGE HARVEST is one of the most widely used tools for signals analysis in the Intelligence Community. It allows the storage and retrieval of parameters, operating characteristics, and structural details of communications signals. The goal of VINTAGE HARVEST is to assist analysts in identifying and tracking known and unknown signals.
(U//FOUO) VINTAGE HARVEST provides the following capabilities:

- The storage of signal descriptions and related parametric information.
- The uploading of sample files and reports relating to a signal.
- Connection to external systems that contain related information such as targets, satellite or proforma data.
- Tracking of metrics used by management for decision-making.
(U//FOUO) VINTAGE HARVEST is going through major changes. The changes will consist of:
- Incorporating the protocol database (PFCBase) into VINTAGE HARVEST that will allow for improved protocol search and analysis capability.
- A VINTAGE HARVEST Metrics Analysis Dashboard that will enhance the ability to track and measure customer usage.
- Automated features to allow for improved data management.
- More quality control features such as additional system data validation and quality acceptance by subject matter experts.
- A capability to handle additional security markings that are in compliance with the current NSA/CSSM classification manual.
- A web-portal that will provide a single point of access to external signal analysis systems and databases in the areas of COMINT, ELINT and FISINT such as E-Space, Acorn Harvest, TEBAG and the Environmental Knowledge Database (EKB), to name a few.
(U//FOUO) Connections to these and other signals related systems will provide analysts and management a more cohesive resource tool that will far exceed the capabilities of the old VINTAGE HARVEST database. The new VINTAGE HARVEST database is expected to be online sometime in June 2005.
(U//FOUO) If you would like to know more about VINTAGE HARVEST and other services that S31125 can provide, please contact us a @nsa, visit our website by typing "go S31125" or call us on @nsa. We look forward to serving the analytical needs of CES, SID and the Intelligence Community in support of NSA missions worldwide.
