(U) Here's a comment on Friday's article Write Right: Too Much Redundancy is Redundant:

From: Anonymous
Comment: (U) Mr. Carlin recently appeared on a news program on MSNBC with Tim Russert. In the interview he warned of "semantic creep" in writing and speech. "Semantic creep" is a term coined by the late Senator Patrick Moynihan. Our organization, and our government is guilty of this many times over and at the highest levels.
(U) "Semantic Creep" is when a softer, "nicer" expression is used to describe something in terms not as jarring, or to slightly mislead. For example, in the past the term "shellshock" was used, but over time and through other iterations we have now come to "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder".
(U) Nowadays a "bomb" or "booby trap" is an "improvised explosive device". A "car bomb" is a "vehicle-borne improvised explosive device". It might look a little less imposing on the page, but it is still a bomb.
(U) Also, we see the term "leadership" used more and more when "management" would be more appropriate. The two terms are related but are not always interchangeable.
(U) "Semantic creep" can be used to soften a description and make it a little easier for the reader (or your listener) to handle. However it can also be used to slightly mislead or slightly misrepresent and in the long run, be counterproductive.
(U) Thanks for a great article!!
