(U//FOUO) From the SID Mailbag: Too Many Passwords!

Question: (U//FOUO) Is there a unified effort to make it easier for all of the people working in SID to manage accounts? I have over 30 accounts for everything from AIRGAP to my UNIX logon which is different from my WINDOWS logon. The situation would be comical if it weren't so ridiculously bothersome. I have to change $1 / 3$ of my passwords every 60 days, another $1 / 3$ every 90 days, and the last $1 / 3$ stays the same forever. Each password has different requirements so trying to keep them straight (without writing them down) is nearly impossible.
(U//FOUO) I know there are systems like Passport and PKI which can be widely used to access multiple accounts. As more and more accounts pop up into our tool boxes as SID workers are there efforts to consolidate accounts and passwords through programs like Passport and PKI certification? (Please say "yes.")

Answer: (U) Yes!
(U//FOUO) According to X7 (ITD Architecture and Development), there is a unified effort to minimize the number of username/password combinations a user must remember. New applications such as CASPORT (see Question 356), combined with modernization of the network infrastructure, Active Directory, will leverage each other to ultimately reduce the number of login accounts for each user. These services will be specific for each network; account information will not be passed across network security boundaries. Leveraging of services will also help to address the password change problem.
