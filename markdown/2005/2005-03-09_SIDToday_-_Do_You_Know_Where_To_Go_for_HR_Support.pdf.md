Who's who in HR (U)
(U//FOUO) The Human Resource Service Center for the Signals Intelligence Directorate has seen some changes. A few employees have left and there are also some new faces to be introduced. Do you know your HR Advisor? Do you know which Program Manager handles which programs? Do you know where to go for answers to your HR questions?
(U//FOUO) The HR Service Center for SID webpage can guide you to the right person for your answers to:

- P3 questions,
- awards,
- beneficiary forms,
- marital status changes,
- military deposits,
- the FLIP program,
- the TEDNE (Temporary Employment During the National Emergency) program, and
- SER (Selective Employment of Retirees)
... just to name a few.
(U//FOUO) Please take a few minutes and become familiar with the names of the HR employees who serve your organization. They are there to help you with all of your HR needs. The webpage's URL is: $\square$
