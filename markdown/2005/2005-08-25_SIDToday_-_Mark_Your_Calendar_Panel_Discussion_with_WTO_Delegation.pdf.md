(C) Mark Your Calendar: Panel Discussion with WTO Delegation

FROM:
Deputy SINIO, Economic and Global Issues (S17)
Run Date: 08/25/2005

What: Panel discussion with American delegates to the next Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization
When: September 9, 1000-1200
Where: R\&E Symposium Center (shuttle service provided)
(C) This December, Hong Kong will be the host for the next Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO has set for itself the ambitious goal of making breakthroughs on its Doha Development Agenda, which aims to boost prosperity among developing nations through increased trade, especially in agriculture and services. At the same time, however, the WTO at past ministerials has faced major roadblocks to progress. Success in Hong Kong will be a major milestone on the road toward greater prosperity and economic independence around the globe.
(C) Six members of the U.S. delegation have generously agreed to take time out of their schedules planning for the ministerial in order to visit NSA for a panel discussion of the issues they face in the "Doha round." They are:

- Dorothy Dwoskin, Assistant United States Trade Representative for WTO Affairs
- Matthew Rohde, Deputy Assistant United States Trade Representative
- Joseph Spetrini, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Import Administration (Acting)
- Skip Jones, Director of the Office of Multilateral Affairs (under the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Market Access and Compliance)
- Kenneth Roberts, Associate Administrator, Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS, under USDA)
- Patricia Sheikh, Deputy Administrator for International Trade Policy (within FAS)
(U) This event will take place September 9, 1000-1200, at the R\&E Symposium Center. No registration required -- just show up! NSA's Transportation Center will provide added shuttle service between the Ops2A gatehouse and the R\&E building before and after the seminar. We invite you to spread the word to colleagues across the Intelligence Community, but we must ask that this event remain open only to US government affiliates. For more information, contact:
