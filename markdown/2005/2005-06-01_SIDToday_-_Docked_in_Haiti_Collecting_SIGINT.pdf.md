(U) Between the months of January and February of this year, Corporal $\square$ (Canadian Air Force) and I took part in the USS Saipan humanitarian mission, Operation New Horizons '05, in Haiti. The primary goal of the mission was to build hospitals, schools, and wells in the coastal town of Gonaives, which had been devastated by Hurricane Jeanne in September 2004. The Saipan is the largest amphibious vessel in the U.S. Navy, holding close to 2,000 troops.

## (U) USS Saipan

(U) When we arrived, the situation in Gonaives was dire, with just a few UN troops patrolling the streets and an almost non-existent Haitian National Police (HNP) presence. Armed gangs control large areas in Gonaives and other cities outside of Port-au-Prince. The city was in shambles, to put it bluntly, when the seabees went on shore to set up camp and begin their projects. While I didn't get a chance to go ashore, my coworkers and I did take an aerial tour by helicopter. The city was covered with dust, and one could clearly see the poverty and the crumbled infrastructure.
(U) The first couple of days, curious onlookers accosted our guys onshore -- the locals wanted to know why we were there. Once they found out, they were very appreciative of the U.S. Navy presence and the work they were about to do. Our main concern going to Gonaives had been the possibility of the gangs organizing the locals to protest our presence there, but this did not transpire.
(S) As language analysts, our mission was to provide SIGINT collection and linguistic support to the intelligence team aboard the Saipan. I worked in the Joint Intelligence Center (JIC) with eight others, all of us under the leadership of LCDR $\square$ We worked in shifts, normally 10-12 hours per day. The crew was professional and courteous.
(TS//SI) In the first couple of days, we created a plan of action in case of a CRITIC situation (i.e., U.S. troops coming under hostile fire). As part of our collection efforts, we swept proper frequency ranges, recovering different networks such as the HNP, United Nations Mission in Stabilization of Haiti (MINUSTAH), Haitian Interim Government (IGOH), and the gang activities. Furthermore, we helped design and translate notices and instructions for the engineering and medical teams who were going onshore.
(U//FOUO) Cpl $\square$ and I both considered this a great experience. Our participation in the USS Saipan mission illustrates the excellent interaction between NSA and CSE (Canada's Communications Security Establishment). The collaboration took place through Latin America and Caribbean Division (S2A32) coordination with the CFIOG (Canadian Forces Information Operations Group Detachment), whose members are integrated into operations here at NSA. We recommend that other teams at the Agency consider how such Second Party cooperation can benefit their missions as well!
