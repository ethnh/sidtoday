(U) The Women in Mathematics Society, or WiMS, is a group of NSA mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers that

- strives to enhance the recruitment and retention of Agency mathematicians.
- supports national efforts to address the underrepresentation of women in mathematics.
- participates in mentoring and networking programs and events.
(U//FOUO) Let's take a quick look back to see how WiMS got its start. In 1993, the statistics on the number of women being hired with advanced degrees in the mathematics community at NSA were not encouraging. Records from 1987 to 1993 reveal that only $26 \%$ of the women hired during that period had higher than a Bachelor's degree, compared with $61 \%$ of men. Furthermore, of the roughly 30 Ph.D. mathematicians hired during that time, only one was female.
(U) In reaction to this situation, senior mathematicians at NSA sponsored the Women in Mathematics Symposium in November 1993, which was attended by close to 60 female mathematicians from the U.S. academic community. The participants learned about NSA's mission and its internal mathematics community, and shared their insights on how NSA could better attract qualified women to its ranks. After the symposium, its organizers continued to meet regularly to work on ways to improve NSA's outreach for women in mathematics, and this group grew to become the Women in Mathematics Society.
(U) Today WiMS is a strong supporter of programs that encourage women to study mathematics at the undergraduate and graduate levels. In particular, members of WiMS frequently volunteer their time as keynote speakers, workshop leaders, and career panelists at events called Sonya Kovalevsky Days. These days are held on college campuses around the nation and are to encourage high school girls to study mathematics and to enter the profession.
(U) WiMS financially supports programs and conferences for women in mathematics at various universities (e.g. the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics), and also sponsors an annual networking session at one of the largest mathematics meetings of the year.
(U) Finally, WiMS works jointly with another Agency program called the Mathematics Education Partnership Program (MEPP) to provide NSA volunteers for activities such as the Mathematics Speakers Bureau, summer camps for K-12 students, summer workshops for

teachers, and tutoring programs.
(U//FOUO) Due in part to the efforts of WiMS, things have changed in the last ten years! Since 1994, about 38\% of women mathematicians hired at NSA hold a Doctoral degree, and roughly 27\% hold Master's degrees. Through its outreach activities and contributions to NSA's mathematics community, WiMS is thriving as an organization. For more information on WiMS, type "go wims" in your Webworld browser.
