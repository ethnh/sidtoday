(U) Giving Thanks
FROM: Charlie Meals SIGINT Deputy Director Run Date: 11/14/2005

It's hard to believe that next week it will be Thanksgiving -- where does the time go?
I've always appreciated learning about traditions people associate with this very special holiday. For some the tradition is the once a year use of treasured family heirloom place settings. For others it's a classic football rivalry that brings together old friends and fond memories. Some choose thanksgiving to host a service member or several who are far from their own families at a time when that distance is keenly felt. For many this holiday is a day when you give thanks by giving to others at a soup kitchen or shelter.

However you choose to celebrate this year I'd like to encourage you to add a new tradition -making a donation to the Combined Federal Campaign. The campaign wraps up this month so the timing with Thanksgiving is a perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your commitment to extending yourself for others in need. There are so many needs, and during the holiday months charities are often overextended to meet demand. This year the holidays will be especially difficult for many of your fellow citizens in the hard hit Gulf States.

Many of you have already given in a very generous way -- just 9\% of the work force has raised us to $65 \%$ of our goal--that's incredible. As we close out the final weeks of this year's campaign I hope that everyone can take some time to at least consider how they might best give thanks through the Combined Federal Campaign.

However you choose to spend Thanksgiving this year, may it be a safe and happy one for you and those you love.
