(TS//SI//REL) In an Enterprise-wide collaboration effort, Menwith Hill Station's New Mission Development Center (NMDC) developed an innovative method for locating large numbers of INMARSAT terminals in a very short period of time. The effort, named SANDGOAT, combines national and FORNSAT data to produce locational information against
in a particular geographic region.
(TS//SI//REL) The results are astounding. Previously, it took up to
to locate INMARSAT terminals, but with SANDGOAT, the time has been reduced to
Moreover, more locations are possible with SANDGOAT than with the existing cross-mission location system for INMARSAT. The accuracy has also improved, with the circular error of probability (CEP) for $50 \%$ of the locations.
