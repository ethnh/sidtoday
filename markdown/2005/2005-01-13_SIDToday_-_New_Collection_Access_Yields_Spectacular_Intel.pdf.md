(TS//SI) One recent SIGINT success against India's Nuclear Weapons Development Program exemplifies the Agency's new environment of cross-program collaboration in satisfying intelligence needs. This is a great example of SIGINT programs working together to achieve a common goal.
(TS//SI) In October 2004, RAINFALL successfully geolocated signals of a suspected Indian nuclear weapons storage facility. This prompted a Foreign Satellite (FORNSAT) collection facility, LEMONWOOD, and the Unidentified Signal and Protocol Analysis Branch (S31124) at NSA to collaborate in isolating these signals and, through signals development, confirm their content as related to Indian nuclear weapons. This breakthrough highlighted the need to deploy additional demodulating equipment to LEMONWOOD in order to expand a modest collection effort undertaken since the signal was discovered in October.

(TS//SI) Immediately after fielding this equipment, collection of this new network began to provide what is being called "spectacular" activity. Exploitation of that collection revealed India's first-ever SAGARIKA Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) launch; $\square$ DHANUSH sea-launched Short Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM); and pilotless target aircraft.
(TS//SI) Collection from this new access has also provided significant intelligence on India's possession of two different types of airdropped bombs, one believed to be a very large Fuel Air Explosive (FAE) bomb of an unidentified type. The other, not yet confirmed by the analytic community, may be a new generation of airdropped nuclear weapons.
(TS//SI) LEMONWOOD has sustained access to satellite communication links: $\square$ The FORNSAT Division is working with the site and the Trans-Asia Product Line (S2A4) to expand collection against this highpriority network.
(S//SI) While the collection that resulted from interagency collaboration has been categorized as spectacular, what is most impressive is the growing trend of collaboration seen across the entire Agency. What were once technological challenges are now collaboration opportunities that offer the promise of a seamless, interoperable and responsive National Security Agency.
