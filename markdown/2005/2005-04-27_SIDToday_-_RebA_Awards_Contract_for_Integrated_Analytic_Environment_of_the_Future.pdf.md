Plans for an improved suite of tools for SIGINT analysts (U)
(U) SIGINT analysts: did you know that the Rebuilding Analysis (RebA) Program is currently working hard to create a less time consuming and hopefully better way for you to perform analysis?
(U//FOUO) RebA has awarded a two year Rebuilding Analysis Development and Integration Contract (or RADIC) to build a near state-of-the art Integrated Analytic Environment (IAE).
(U//FOUO) The IAE will be the operational platform supporting and providing access to virtually all of the applications used by production analysts. The first iteration of the IAE, which is known as Increment 1 in NSA acquisition terminology, will contain the basic analytic tools most of you use today. It will be on your desktop, at NSA Washington, in late 2006. Some lucky folks, known as "early adopters," have volunteered to work with the IAE and its embedded applications well before that time to ensure that the developers and RebA get it right.
(S//SI) The key feature of the IAE is its suite of common desktop applications and services accessible via a single sign-on. Within the IAE, you will be able to personalize your desktop applications to fit your needs. No matter where you log-in, they will be available to you with the same look and feel. Among the capabilities contained within the IAE are:

- a query service,
- information viewing applications,
- an event tracking and session management service,
- the ability to click-to-send,
- a target knowledge database update service,
- a collaboration tool suite, and
- multiple viewers, such as metadata, network graph, timeline, geospatial data, and 2D/3D graphical data viewers.
(S//SI) Also included will be workflow and data mediation, logging, auditing and personalization services, as well as native font handling. Standard language dictionary, machine translation, and transcription services are also included in the IAE, as well as SIGDev Learning Portal access, SIGINT-On-Demand reporting and authoring services, and information need and tasking analysis services. There are many other corporate services that will be available as well. In addition, RebA is building into the IAE a target dossier capability featuring six windows to view various aspects of target activity (detailed, social network, communications, travel, financial and network views). All of these will interact with the target knowledge base.
(U//FOUO) The IAE doesn't end with Increment 1 deliverables. The basic IAE will be enhanced and upgraded in an Increment 2 delivery that will be released to production analysts in the latter half of 2008. Many new analytic discovery applications will be available to you, such as hypothesis mapping, advanced analytics to discover patterns and anomalies, enumerate behaviors, provide target simulations, support SIGINT development and language analysis, and to learn and apply best practices from your previous analysis and automate your workflow. These applications are scheduled to be available at the desktop to analysts at NSAW and at many analytic centers throughout the extended SIGINT enterprise.
(U//FOUO) The objective of the RebA initiatives is to provide NSA Washington, and eventually all SIGINT analysts, with a time-saving, automated, and fully integrated suite of capabilities which
will enable you to more efficiently and effectively perform your duties and free you to engage in more predictive and critical analysis.
