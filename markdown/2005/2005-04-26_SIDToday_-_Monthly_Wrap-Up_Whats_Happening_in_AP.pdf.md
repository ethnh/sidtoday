# Proliferation and Arms Control (PAC) Product Line Is Renamed the Combating Proliferation (CP) Product Line (U//FOUO) 

(U//FOUO) As of 17 April, S2G, the Proliferation and Arms Control (PAC) Product Line, has been renamed the Combating Proliferation (CP) Product Line. The name change reflects a more activist approach to dealing with proliferation players and aligns the PL more closely in name with the national counterproliferation mission and partners. The PL change also aligns the organization more closely in name with the Combating Proliferation Issue Management Team (IMT), a key partner for the PL in making headway on the CP mission.
