(U//FOUO) Below is a correction to yesterday's article 'Surging' for the Iraqi Elections
(U//FOUO) The article stated that reservists were used, when in fact it was the NSA Crisis Action Cell (CAC) cadre that staffed the 24/7 Iraq Elections Desk in NSOC. Also, web developers in NSOC created the Iraq Elections web site for NSANet, while the Intelink office created the Intelink version; MOC personnel were responsible for making updates to those web sites.
(U) Corrections have been made to the article text.
