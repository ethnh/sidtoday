(U) New SIGINT Feedback Form - Just in Time for the Holidays!

FROM:
Information Needs (S111)
Run Date: 12/09/2005
"Half the world is composed of people who have something to say and can't, and the other half consists of people who have nothing to say and keep on saying it."

- Robert Frost
(U//FOUO) This quote may be true for the rest of the world, but when it comes to the Intelligence Community, it is not true at all. Every day, NSA receives feedback on the reports we produce. A copy of this feedback is automatically forwarded to the originator, analysts, linguists and releasers of the report and is also stored in the PLUS/SKYCAST database for future reference.
(U//FOUO) On 13 December 2005, the new SIGINT Feedback Form* will be operational and available. The webpage/location will not change. Just type "go sigintfeedback." The new PKIenabled form has several new features and enhancements. Among the most important features is that the form consolidates all Feedback Management functions into one user-friendly form.
- (U//FOUO) Create Feedback will prompt you to enter the serial number(s) of the report(s) for which you are providing feedback. The serial and format will be validated. At this point you may enter your PLUS password, which will allow you to see the report title. (Thus allowing you to verify that feedback is being entered for the correct report!) When the feedback is submitted, it will be instantly available via the PLUS Feedback Retrieval Tool.
- (U//FOUO) Edit Feedback is a great, new feature in this version. It allows you to change or delete the feedback you previously created. Note: You are permitted to change/delete only your own feedback.
- (U//FOUO) Manage Your Customers is another new feature in the Feedback form. You can add, delete or edit your customer list while in this part of the form. The "Manage Your Customers" section will be most useful (and time saving!) to people who enter feedback on the customer's behalf.
(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Feedback Form is a valuable tool in our customer support toolbox. We urge you to use it often! Feedback is always a great way to improve your customer support!
* (U//FOUO) The SIGINT Feedback Form is a web-based application - which means you can run it on your Windows or your UNIX workstation from your favorite web browser. Explorer 5.5 or Netscape 7.0 are recommended.
