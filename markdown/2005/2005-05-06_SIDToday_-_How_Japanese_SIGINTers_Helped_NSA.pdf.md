# (S//SI) How Japanese SIGINTers Helped NSA

## Third Party cooperation yielded valuable collection against

(U) From the recent-history book, here's a great example of how NSA's foreign partnerships can translate into success for the United States Cryptologic System (USCS).
(S//SI) For many years, NSA had maintained continuity on
signal
Collection of the signal allowed us to identify the transmitting and to DF* the user, which provided location, although the text of the communications was unreadable. Many organizations in the Intelligence Community were the beneficiaries of the related intelligence, and especially PACOM* for its mission $\square$ in its area of operations.
(U//FOUO) Ominously, had been in decline throughout 2002, and eventually disappeared.
(S//SI) At the end of July 2003, Japan's Directorate for SIGINT (DFS) notified us of their belief that they had found the replacement signal for $\square$ The next month, representatives from NSA Headquarters and KRSOC* quickly visited the DFS to confirm the find. The signal was confirmed as the successor to $\square$ and NSA switched into high gear to get a collection capability developed and deployed.
(S//SI) We're now able to recognize, collect, demodulate and decode the signal, as we could the signal. While the underlying text remains enciphered and unreadable, as was $\square$ we're able to distinguish valid messages from practice/test messages through traffic analysis of message externals. Also, we're once again able to identify the $\square$ and we're enjoying greater success in DF-ing the transmitter.
(S//SI) In honor of DFS's discovery, NSA deferred to DFS in the naming of the new signal. The signal's cover name is
(S//SI) This event highlights the benefits reaped by the USCS and the Intelligence Community through NSA's SIGINT partnerships. The DFS discovery and subsequent NSA-DFS collaboration have allowed us to continue to provide the Intelligence Community, and particularly PACOM, with intelligence related to a $\square$, thereby ensuring security in the Pacific Theater.
(S//SI) To date, NSA has continued a robust technical exchange with the DFS on $\square$
