(U) A Different Kind of 'Campaign Update'

FROM: Charlie Meals
SIGINT Deputy Director
Run Date: 10/20/2005

SID's reputation for generosity through the Combined Federal Campaign is reflected in the strong start since the campaign kicked off on 5 October. I'm proud to be part of an organization that has such a tremendous capacity for giving--both to mission and to the needs of the community. I think that has always been one of the real treasures of working at NSA, knowing that you're a part of so many important dimensions of what makes America great. We are an agency that gives as much outside of the office as we do inside.

When I went online to make my own choices I was struck by the range and diversity of giving options that seem to grow with every passing year. Whatever your interest might be it seems that there is an opportunity to express yourself through the CFC. As I reviewed the choices I thought about the stark needs of so many Americans in the Gulf Coast states; I thought about the increased demands on organizations that support our service men and women and their families; I thought about the medical and family care programs that touch the lives of so many of us; I thought about social issues about which I care deeply; and I thought about enrichment programs that I have enjoyed with my family over the past year. None of these activities can be successful without commitment and support through fundraisers like the Combined Federal Campaign. I take pleasure in knowing that I'm making a difference where I can; and that when or if I have to avail myself of some service I'll know that I've contributed to their ability to succeed.

If you've never given through the Combined Federal Campaign, or if your giving has fallen off in recent years, I encourage you to make a list of things that matter in your life and spend a moment looking at the options to say "thanks" to organizations and activities that are making a difference for you.

To paraphrase the CFC slogan, "Every one of you counts" in making our nation more secure and "every one of your donations" -- big or small -- counts in strengthening the fabric of the society you serve and protect.

Thank you for taking the time to consider your role in this year's Combined Federal Campaign.
