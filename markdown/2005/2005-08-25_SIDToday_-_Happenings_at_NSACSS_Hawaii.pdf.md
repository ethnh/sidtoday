(U) Happenings at NSA/CSS Hawaii

FROM: Colonel Mark Westergren, USAF
Director, NSA/CSS Hawaii Signals Intelligence Directorate (HSID)
Run Date: 08/25/2005
(U//FOUO) SID today presents its first periodic update from NSA/CSS Hawaii in Kunia. This is part of a running series of operational updates from the SID Deputy Directorates and the Cryptologic Centers (former RSOCs).

# (U) Senior Leadership Activities 

(U//FOUO) The HSID staff welcomes the two most recent arrivals to its key leadership: Colonel Mark Westergren, USAF as the Signals Intelligence Director and Ms. Sally Holcomb as the Signals Intelligence Deputy Director at NSA/CSS Hawaii.
(U//FOUO) Colonel Westergren joins us having just completed a year as an Air Force Fellow to the Rand Corporation. He brings over 20 years of experience with a background in physics, weapons systems and intelligence operations.
(U//FOUO) Ms. Sally Holcomb, NSA/DISES joins the HSID from NSAW where she served in the Office of the Director as a National Security Agency/Central Security Service Director's Executive Assistant. Ms. Holcomb brings over 18 years of experience with a background in Asian language, policy and security including a previous tour at Kunia as the Director of Security (J2).

## (U) Operations

(U//FOUO) Hawaii Build-Out
(S//SI) The mission realignment and build out continues. As the Kunia Regional Security Operations Center (KRSOC) became National Security Agency Central Security Service (NSA/CSS), Hawaii, the KRSOC Operations Directorate (J3) became the Hawaii Signals Intelligence Directorate (HSID) . This transformation represents more than a simple redesignation of specific offices. It is an intentional alignment of form and function corresponding, as directly as possible, to the enterprise-wide mission and resource management structure. This restructuring occurs in concert with a largely identical process at NSA/CSS Texas and Georgia. The newly restructured HSID is patterned after NSA Washington and is comprised of five key organizations:

- HS/S0 SID Staff - Leadership and directorate-level staff functions
- HS1 - Customer Gateway, Customer Relations, Warfighter Support
- HS2 - Analysis and Production, reporting and Product Line support
- HS3 - Access and Collection, Processing and Exploitation, Collection Management and Computer Network Exploitation
- HSSG - SIGDEV Strategy \& Governance, SIGDEV, Target Development
