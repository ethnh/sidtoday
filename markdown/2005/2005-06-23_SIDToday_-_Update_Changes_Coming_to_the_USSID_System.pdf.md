(U) Update: Changes Coming to the USSID System

FROM: the USSID Re-engineering Team (S02L1)
Unknown
Run Date: 06/23/2005
(U//FOUO) In a December 2004 SID today article, the USSID Re-engineering Team announced their plan to create, re-format, and re-organize United States Signals Intelligence Directives (USSIDs) to make the USSID system more complete, accessible, and flexible for governing today's SIGINT production processes. This USSID re-engineering process has continued, and is about to reach a major milestone with the implementation of new, more logical groupings and alphanumeric designators for all USSIDs.
(U//FOUO) This change will be made to online USSIDs ("go USSID") on or about 12 July 2005 , and has been coordinated with SID senior management. It is being announced to all concerned elements of the USSS via multiple communications channels (including SID today ) to ensure a smooth transition. Further details and crosswalk information are available at the USSID Reengineering Web Site .
(U//FOUO) The USSID Re-engineering Team is continuing to work to ensure that USSIDs are an accurate source of information for governing the SIGINT Enterprise of today and tomorrow, from Headquarters to the Extended Enterprise.
