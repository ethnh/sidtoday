(U//FOUO) SIGINT leaders from near and far will converge on Fort Meade next week for an important annual conference -- the SIGINT Site Commanders Operational Review, or "SCOR Conference," running from November 7th through 9th. What's on the agenda? If you've been following leadership activities, it should come as no surprise that this year's SCOR is all about synchronizing and optimizing the US SIGINT System (USSS) as part of the larger governance effort. (See a related article.)

U//FOUO) Last year's SCOR Conference laid the groundwork for a truly global SIGINT system. This year, USSS leaders from around the globe will get out their tape measures, hammers and nails and start making this vision a reality. Main topics of discussion will include:

- The Strategic Mission List - a list of "must-do" targets, used for making decisions on resource allocation (see article ).
- Mission Assessment - how are we doing against all those targets and how do we expect to do.
- Improving the performance of the "red/orange" missions, i.e. high-priority missions for which we have poor or limited capabilities.
- The Placemat Goals and the Long Range Plan.
- Moving toward net-centricity
