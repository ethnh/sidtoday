(U//FOUO) New and Improved 2005 Information Needs Satisfaction Survey

FROM:
Information Needs and Outcomes Branch (S1111)
Run Date: 06/06/2005
(U//FOUO) What: Do you remember the Information Needs Satisfaction Survey from last fall? This month, S111, the Information Needs Division in Customer Gateway, is sponsoring a new IN Satisfaction Survey and we need your input.
(U//FOUO) After reviewing the results of our earlier survey, and to attract a larger number of responses, we've redesigned the instrument to ask a more focused set of questions. It is our goal to obtain feedback that will help us ensure that the Information Needs have a greater impact on the decision making process.
(U//FOUO) When: Now through 27 June 2005.
(U//FOUO) Who: SID and extended enterprise analysts, managers, and SIGINT enablers are invited and encouraged to participate in the ten-minute survey.
(U//FOUO) Why: The survey is a vehicle for you to voice your opinions and facilitate change. Your responses will form the basis for developing and prioritizing enhancements to the IN process and associated tools. We intend to continuously increase active customer participation in steering the SIGINT system while improving analyst satisfaction and providing clear, precise answers for our customers.
