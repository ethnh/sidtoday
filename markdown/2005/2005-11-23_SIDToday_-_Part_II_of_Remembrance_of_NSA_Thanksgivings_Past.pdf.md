(U) We asked NSA'ers to send us their stories of spending Thanksgiving in unusual circumstances (see the call for submissions). Here's what we learned...

# (U) Thanksgiving Down Under 

(U) While an integree at DSD in Melbourne, Australia, we hosted a Thanksgiving dinner for a group of Aussies and Americans. Since this came less than a month after we hosted a costumed Halloween party, one of my co-workers at DSD asked whether anything special needed to be worn for Thanksgiving. I told him with a straight face that he and his wife could either dress as pilgrims or just wear an apple on a string around their necks. I guess they couldn't find black shoes with big buckles, because they showed up on Thanksgiving, each with a shiny red apple on a string tied around their necks. Being extremely good sports, they wore them for the entire evening.

## (U) Midway Between Turkey and Curry

(S) I spent Thanksgiving Day 1986 at Midway Island on a TDY to support Operation PONY EXPRESS. Air Force C-130 and Navy P-3 and EP-3 collection aircraft staged from there to monitor a fullrange Russian SLBM (Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile) test launch impacting in the ocean near Midway.
(U) The large group of TDY personnel made for crowded conditions on an island already imumdated with gooney birds. The Leyte albatross, called the gooney bird for it's less-than-graceful landing technique, flock to Midway Island in the winter to mate and raise their young. The squawking and bill-clicking of their mating rituals was a constant cacophony during the day. The gooney is not an exceptionally brilliant bird either. We found a stray tennis ball on the walkway and rolled it toward a nearby gooney bird sitting on its nest. The bird stared at for a moment before repositioning herself to cover the tennis ball as well as her egg.
(U) We enjoyed a traditional Thanksgiving dinner on the island, although there was a slight hint of curry to it. The Navy outsourced base services to ITT, who had staffed the place with Sri Lankan workers. There was a curry dish available at every meal in the cafeteria, including breakfast, and the taste of it was everywhere. I don't think the dishwasher removed the curry from the plates and utensils, just redistributed it in a fine layer on everything.
(U) Thanksgiving in the Cotswolds
(U//FOUO) A cold and heavy fog hung over the Cotswold hills in southwest England as temperatures hovered in the very low 40s while members of the Special U.S. Liaison Office
(London/Cheltenham) (SUSLOL) family gathered to celebrate Thanksgiving 2005. As in past years, this celebration was planned and orchestrated by an impressive list of 43 SUSLOL volunteers and their families. Close to 150 family members attended the event, which was the largest SUSLOL family Thanksgiving dinner I've had the privilege to attend. Being at an overseas location during the holidays does not mean we -- as Americans -- leave our traditions and values behind. While we may not always have the opportunity to share in the traditional holiday gatherings with our immediate families back in the U.S., the SUSLOL family is one that we all appreciate and will miss. As with most Thanksgiving family dinners, our SUSLOL family feast had all the usually trimmings of turkey, ham, stuffing, mashed potatoes, breads, desserts and many more calorie-laden items. SUSLOL Chief Chris Inglis welcomed everyone and thanked us all for serving our country in ways only we could. $\qquad$ gave the invocation and master-of-ceremonies $\qquad$ orchestrated the rush to the buffet table. As the afternoon was winding down and the turkey leftovers were being sent home with many families members, only to reappear one day as a turkey sandwich, the SUSLOL families said their goodbyes and disappeared in the heavy fog longing to continue the post-Thanksgiving dinner tradition -- a nap on the sofa.

Written on behalf of all SUSLOL family members!
(U) Watch for Part III of this Thanksgiving series tomorrow!
