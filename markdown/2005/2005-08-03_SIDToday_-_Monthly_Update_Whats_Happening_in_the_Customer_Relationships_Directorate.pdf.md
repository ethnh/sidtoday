(U) Monthly Update: What's Happening in the Customer Relationships Directorate

FROM: Charles Berlin
SID/Deputy Director for Customer Relationships (S1)

(U) The monthly wrap-up from CRD...

# Senior Leadership Activities 

(U//FOUO) Not long ago I held the first of what I envision as a series of regularly scheduled town meetings to keep the CRD workforce up to date on the changes being considered, underway and those recently accomplished.
(U//FOUO) CRD helps deliver the right information in the right format to the right customers to safeguard our nation's security. In the future we will employ a global network of "hubs," focused on our customer relationships in a particular region, carrying out operations wherever it makes the most sense. We are hosting the heads of the S1 hubs from Denver, Georgia, Hawaii and Texas on $3 \& 4$ August for deeper discussions about functions, structure and governance.
(U//FOUO) This new positioning of our resources means we must gain an even deeper understanding of each customer's mission, key decision points, priorities, information needs and opportunities, so that we can get them the information they need to do their jobs better.

## Operations

## (U//FOUO) Military Integration (formerly S13) became part of the National Tactical

Integration Office (S14) organization. The new NTIO is restructuring to become a military requirements analysis and facilitation organization. It will work to more fully integrate NSA/CSS with the warfighter and help integrate advanced technology into tactical cryptologic systems.
(U//FOUO) This newly formed organization will have strong partnerships across NSA, with the U.S. military and the Service Cryptologic Elements (SCEs). These connections will help us maximize relationships with foreign partner SIGINT services and their respective defense elements. In addition, we aim to develop an end-to-end partnership with the military and SCEs -- NSA can contribute to areas such as training and exercises for the future tactical force. As we merge our functions and shift responsibilities, we will ensure that support currently being provided will continue at the same levels.
(S//SI) In response to the recent London bombings, Information Sharing Services (S12) has been working even more closely with their GCHQ* counterparts to ensure the timeliest possible sharing of bomb-related information. In addition, NSA has allowed GCHQ to make extraordinary use of certain DNI information from NSA reports that will enhance the UK's ability to investigate the 7 and 21 July bombings.

## Personnel Moves

(U//FOUO)
