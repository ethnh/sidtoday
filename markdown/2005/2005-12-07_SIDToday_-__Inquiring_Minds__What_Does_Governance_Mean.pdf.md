(U//FOUO) If you work in SID, you've no doubt heard the term "Governance" being bandied about for a while now... What are these people talking about? Allow SID today to offer an explanation. Simply said, Governance is management. In the world of SIGINT, Governance refers to:

- Synchronizing and optimizing the US SIGINT System (USSS);
- Empowerment and accountability at the lowest possible levels; and
- Conveying DIRNSA's intent by focusing on mission, partnering, horizontal integration, intelligence community sharing.
(U//FOUO) SID's Senior Leadership has been crafting a Governance framework for about 18 months now. The processes established in the Governance framework will ensure that SIGINTers at all levels understand their particular SIGINT missions as well as their roles in accomplishing those missions. Making these Governance processes a routine practice is paramount and training on how to do so has already begun.**
(U//FOUO) Governance entails many processes and concepts that will, in and of themselves, merit definition. Look for these terms in SID today between now and the end of December. To get the ball rolling with our "Governance Topic-of-the-Day" series, we'll define the concept of Governance itself:
(U//FOUO) The goal of Governance, in the SIGINT context, is to ensure that the various parts of the USSS are working well together and thus create a synchronized USSS. Governance will set the stage for a connection that reaches from national leadership all the way to NSA's newest hires. Within the Governance framework, statements of high-level intent will be provided to all USSS elements in order to guide lower-level decision-making as we carry out SIGINT and CNO.


## (U) So, how are we going to do this?

(U//FOUO) To accomplish this, SID Senior Leadership has outlined four Governance tasks and 17 subordinate responsibilities for the USSS. A brief description of those tasks follows:

- Task \#1 - Provide SIGINT to the Nation ;
- Task \#2 - Direct the USSS in its SIGINT Production ;
- Task \#3 - Prepare the USSS to provide dominant SIGINT in the future ;
- Task \#4 - Support the development of Computer Network Attack (CNA) capabilities and operations .
(U//FOUO) Governance of the USSS is part of a larger NSA/CSSwide effort, which is spelled out in NSA/CSS Policy 1-3. This policy
