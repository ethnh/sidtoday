## Learn about SID Orientation classes (U)

(U) Are you new to the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID)? If you are, would it help you do your job better if you knew more of what was going on in the other Deputy Directorates (S1, S2 or S3)? Of course it would! It is for that reason the Signals Intelligence Directorate offers an Orientation every month.
(C) During the two days of the class, recently hired or assigned personnel are exposed to the many facets of SID. Besides briefings covering topics from Tailored Access to the SID's activities that support the Border Patrol, SID attendees are given the opportunity to have a conversation with the Chief of Staff from their Deputy Directorate and much, much more. The benefits of attending the SID Orientation for those new to SID are often far beyond their expectations.
