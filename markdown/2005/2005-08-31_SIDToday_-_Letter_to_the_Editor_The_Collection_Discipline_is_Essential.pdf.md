(U//FOUO) Here's a comment on the recent article Planning the Future of the Collection Skill Community :

From:
(C//SI) The mere fact that we are finally realizing that "collecting signals" is an essential part of the SIGINT process is refreshing. Collection, as a discipline, is much different today than ten years ago. In another ten years, given the rapid growth of technology, it will be radically different from today. BUT, somebody will still need to collect the signal, collection managers will still need to help analysts weed through the maze of signals and communications paths available to the target and data flow folks will still need to get the signal to the appropriate processor so that it can be delivered to the analyst. While it is critical that the art of analysis be reborn, we must also bring the collection and forwarding disciplines along with it.
