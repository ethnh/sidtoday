(U//FOUO) Redesign of A\&P
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA Signals Intelligence Director Run Date: 05/18/2005
(U//FOUO) I have approved a proposal from Carl Johnson, Deputy Director for Analysis and Production, to redesign the Analysis and Production Directorate to align our "Know It" mission in a manner consistent with the strategic direction and expectations stemming from Intelligence Community, NSA and SID plans. The new framework will optimize DDAP's existing strengths to operate in a seamless, global, net-centric environment. This proposal includes the creation of new roles to address the strategic, capabilities-based, and end-to-end operational responsibilities that will define the direction of our enterprise. A forthcoming Personnel Assignment Order "Green Sheet" will identify the individuals selected to fill these positions; in the meantime, I want to acquaint you with the new positions, and the scope of responsibility entailed.
(U//FOUO) Group Chiefs : Responsible for the Analysis and Production System worldwide -"keeping it relevant." Also responsible for transformation initiatives; community horizontal integration; knowledge management; interface standards with CRD, DA, SIGDEV, IAD.

Global Capabilities Managers (GCM): Responsible for end-to-end Operations of the Product Line; assigns mission responsibilities to production centers; works with Cryptologic Center chiefs to align resources, understand and maintain capabilities; optimizes across national and tactical missions.

Primary Production Center Managers (PPCM): Manages the Production Center (the Production Line "center of gravity"). In that role, the PPCM reports to and backs up the GCM to coordinate and optimize worldwide production and current operations.

Production Center Leads (PCL): Responsible for the day-to-day operations of a Production Center.

Cryptologic Centers : Centers of cryptologic capability, including but not limited to analysis and production capability, with broad regional, technical, and/or target focus.

Production Centers : Can vary in size from $\sim 200$ analysts at a large Cryptologic Center to a single analyst at an F6 site. Production Centers are authorized by the GCM to analyze and disseminate SIGINT on a specified set of targets.
(U//FOUO) The redesign of A\&P will align similar missions in discrete management structures; for example, all missions focused on nation-states or geographic regions will operate under one of the Group Chiefs. By this means, missions with comparable kinds of targets, using similar kinds of information and communications systems, and collaborating with many of the same types of customers and partners, will be organized under a Group Chief who will deal with issues relating to their resources, their requirements for collection, and their customer demands. Apportioning these responsibilities across the three new Group Chiefs also eliminates an impossible span of control problem for DDAP -- trying to maintain comprehensive awareness of the issues and actions of 12 different product lines. The GCMs will be responsible for the global operations of the product line, overseeing the operations of the PPCM, PCLs, and other analysis and production activities. The leaders in those elements are responsible for the day-to-day operations. This change separates two very challenging functions and should result in a better focus on the operation of the entire product line.
(U//FOUO) Carl has commissioned two transition teams to further define and implement this structure; look for further communications from him providing additional information on this important S2 redesign on the S2 website:
