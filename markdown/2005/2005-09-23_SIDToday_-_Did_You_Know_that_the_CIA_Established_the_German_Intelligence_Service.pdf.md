(U) James Critchfield, a US Army officer turned CIA agent, gathered up the remnants of the Wehrmacht's Fremde Heere Ost (Foreign Armies East) military intelligence (MI) establishment and set them to work on the Soviet intelligence problem. His principal implement was General Reinhard Gehlen, chief of MI on the Russian Front, although over the years it became increasingly difficult to tell who was using whom. Critchfield worked in Pullach, a suburb of Munich, out of a Nazi-era compound known as the Martin-Bormann-Settlement, now BND (German intelligence) headquarters, in Bormann's own office in a building known as the White House.
(U) Distinguished visitors like our own PDFA (Principal Director, Foreign Affairs) will be very familiar with this office, as it has been the office of the President of the BND since Gehlen first assumed that title. Ironically, this fact is compounding the difficulty BND is having in their attempt to relocate to Berlin. BND had planned to finance the move by the sale of their existing headquarters. Although it is prime real estate in an exclusive area, it is proving difficult to sell for redevelopment, since the White House and much of the Martin-Bormann-Settlement are under an order of historical preservation.
(U) Some relevant dates follow:

- 22 May 1945 - Reinhard Gehlen surrenders to the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC).
- July 1946 - Gehlen released from US captivity.
- 1946 - CIA begins building a foreign intelligence service in occupied Germany under the name "Organization Gehlen."
- 1947 - Organization Gehlen moves into the Martin-Bormann-Settlement in Pullach by Munich.
- 1949 - With the promulgation of the Federal Republic of Germany, Organization Gehlen begins to serve two masters, the FRG and the CIA.
- 1956 - BND is officially established with Gehlen as its first president.
- 1968 - Gehlen retires as President of the BND.
- 1979 - Reinhard Gehlen dies on 8 June at the age of 77.
