(U) Guidance from the SIGINT Director on Machine Room Management Procedures

FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 12/22/2005

# (U//FOUO) The below message relates to EXECmessage-120: "Information Technology Directorate Machine Room Management (MRM) " 

(U) I want to add my endorsement to the subject procedures and my expectations for compliance within the US SIGINT System (USSS). This initiative will enhance the overall security, operations, safety, and cleanliness of our cryptologic machine rooms.
(U//FOUO) This is an important piece in our relationship to the Information Technology Directorate (ITD) as part of USSS governance responsibility number 7 "To operate the stations, facilities, and systems of the NSA Global SIGINT Enterprise as an effective and unified organization." It will also improve the configuration control of IT equipment, USSS mission applications, and data storage in ITD supported machine rooms, and strengthen our relationship with ITD in areas of mutual interest. By improving our corporate governance and configuration management practices, these procedures will improve the reliability of SIGINT systems and make it easier to assess and repair mission systems in the future.
(U) My intent is that we should suffer no limitation to or loss of SIGINT support due to preventable practices in our machine rooms.
(U//FOUO) ITD will host a number of information sessions to explain the new procedures and to answer any questions about implementation-- watch for details of these sessions in agency_all e-mails. I want to ensure that the SIGINT System is working with ITD to comply with these procedures and is contributing to keeping them up to date, with the goal of improving the safety, security, and operations of our machine rooms. I encourage the full engagement of the USSS as we work to enhance the governance processes that will lead to the continual improvement of our ability to produce SIGINT.
