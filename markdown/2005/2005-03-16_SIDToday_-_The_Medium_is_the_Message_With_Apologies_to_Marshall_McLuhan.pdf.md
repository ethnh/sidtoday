The Latest Stage in the Evolution of Database Reporting (U)
(S//SI) Last October, the Analysis \& Production Operations Staff told you about the Database Reporting Initiative ( "Making SIGINT Sharable -- The Database Is the Report" ). Now this initiative has progressed a step further: we are pleased to announce that advanced SIGINT database reports -- serialized, searchable, relational, and password-protected -- have now been published on Intelink and the Second Party Mall. These database reports are available at
access requires an account, and the site includes an account application). External customers were briefed about this new capability starting in mid-March, and initial reaction has been very positive. This initiative supports DIRNSA's instruction to the workforce, expressed in "Cryptology as a Team Sport" to "live in [our customers'] information space in order to engage them at the earliest possible stages in our respective processes." (See reference ).
(S//SI) These reports, on the topic of Iranian nuclear procurement, are being published by the Office of Proliferation and Arms Control's Nuclear Branch (S2G11), the CBW and CBRN** Terrorism Branch (S2G13), and the Publication Development Branch's EPIC** team (S1231). The three offices and their parent organizations worked long and hard to ensure that all reporting requirements for accountability and tracking of source data were met. S2G11 and S2G13 issued a Precis, standard procedure for such reporting vehicles as Hardcopy and Multimedia reports, electronically notifying customers where the actual "reports" are available and acting as placeholders in the ANCHORY product report database.

About Iranian Nuclear Procurement Reporting... (TS//SI)
(TS//SI) With the support of Operation SIGINT, the Iranian Nuclear Procurement database reporting initiative has made it possible to publish large volumes of easily formatted data ("structured content") quickly and efficiently. This database reporting supplements (rather than replaces) current SIGINT reporting on these targets -- customers now have greater access to valuable SIGINT information than ever before.
(TS//SI) So far, the data include categories for: procurement, organizations, people, account numbers, shipping information, conferences, and papers. S2G13 currently has a data set available only for CBW, but an additional data set for CBRN is expected this year. A requirement for a PAC High-Interest Cargoes (HIC) database has also been established.

Post-Publication Requests? (U)
(U) Customers can submit post-publication requests, to include sanitization requests, by using the database serial number and the record identification number. At the start of each new year, the database name will remain the same, but will be assigned a new annual serial number reflecting the date change.

Questions? (U)
(U) A Database Reporting FAQ is available on EPIC's "Structured SIGINT Sharing Space ("go 4s") webpage; it lists the many benefits of this extension of delivery services. S2G1 would appreciate knowing what users think of this new capability, and the EPIC team is eager to find and address problem areas and help develop standards for storing and presenting data, so that this concept can be applied to other data sources.
(U) Both the target offices and the database developers encourage feedback via the SIGINT Database Reporting feedback option (on Intelink:
and S2G1 analysts are willing to host demos for interested workcenters. The RebA (Rebuilding Analysis) Program Office is making funds available to support this venture. We urge other target offices to consider taking advantage of this opportunity to optimize customer access by contacting the EPIC team at or via e-mail at
