(U//FOUO) New SID Diversity Home Page
FROM:
SID Diversity Management (S01)
Run Date: 08/04/2005
(U//FOUO) The new SID Diversity Home Page and web site is up! We hope to make it the "nexus" of the organization's diversity information, maintaining a stronger and more current library of resources and more extensive linking to other diversity activities outside of SID.
(U//FOUO) The site will include a web page called "From the Desk of the Diversity Guy" that will provide insight and happenings from desks of SID's Diversity Managers. The page is intended to provoke engagement, informal dialog between SID's workforce and us. Please go and take a look at the new web site -- we welcome your suggestions.
