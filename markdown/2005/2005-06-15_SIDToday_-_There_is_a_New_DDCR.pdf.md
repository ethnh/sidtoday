# (U) There is a New DDCR 

FROM: Charles H. Berlin, III
Deputy Director for Customer Relationships
Run Date: 06/15/2005

The following is directed to the Customer Relationships Directorate and holds items of interest to all of SID.(U)

Good Morning CRD!
(U//FOUO) As you know by now, $\square$ is transitioning to her new position as D/SUSLOL. As she leaves us, I would like to thank her for her leadership and for the transformational initiatives she has championed. She has put CRD on the right path and we'll continue along that course.
(S//SI) I'm looking forward to my new role as the DDCR. I appreciate your dedication and all of your hard work. It seems we have been going 100 MPH these last months as we support the Global War on Terrorism in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Keeping our colleagues and countrymen in harms way always in the forefront of our minds is a motivator. We have some exciting opportunities ahead of us as well.
(S//SI) You may have heard me talk about "CR Nation." I coined this term to talk about how we, in CR, operate on a global basis. Our mission is vitally important. In fact, the first word of the first goal of NSA's strategic plan is the word deliver. We are responsible for ensuring that the right information is delivered to the right person at the right time. It will take a global team to do this and it's important that we move toward a state of transparency through all cryptologic nodes worldwide. As an integral mission partner, we must remember that, in addition to our customer-facing mission, we have an inward facing part of CR that passes on the needs to the rest of the USSS in terms it can understand. Translating customer information needs into prioritized SIGINT tasks or needs for new capabilities and communicating it to the rest of the system is just as important. One of our major goals will be to ensure the success of S2 and S3.
(U//FOUO) In addition to our constant mission operations we will continue on the road of Transformation. Transformation 2.0, where mission blending is one of the six major themes, is far from done. The goal of mission blending is to leverage our "industrial strength SIGINT and IA capabilities." This has led to the creation of "centers" such as the NTOC and NCSC. We are contemplating new centers in the near future. These new centers and our Cryptologic Centers in Georgia, Texas, Colorado and Hawaii will need our best support and their success represents another crucial goal for us.
(U) I will be communicating with you often about these and other initiatives. However, I want to hear from you as well. We'll be scheduling some town meetings in the near future to share information and to begin this dialogue.
(U) This next year will be one of increased turbulence and uncertainty. A new DIRNSA and the new DNI will undoubtedly add new challenges to our days. I know you are up to the challenge you have a marvelous record of excellence. Let's see what the future brings!
