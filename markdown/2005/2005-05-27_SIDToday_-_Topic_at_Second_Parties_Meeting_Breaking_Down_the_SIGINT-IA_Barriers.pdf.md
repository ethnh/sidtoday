(C) Topic at Second Parties Meeting: Breaking Down the SIGINT-IA Barriers

FROM:
SUSLO-Canberra (F33)
Run Date: 05/27/2005

5-EYES reps compare notes on bringing SIGINT and Information Assurance (and HUMINT) closer together ( $C$ )
(C) In March I arrived in Canberra, Australia, to fill the newly created position of NSA Information Assurance Directorate Liaison and Integree. Within weeks of my arrival at DSD I had the opportunity to see the interrelation of SID and IAD from a different perspective, by attending the 2005 5-eyes ENIGMA meeting. The ENIGMA 5-eyes working group looks at the issue of electronic attack (eA), specifically how to detect, investigate, respond to, and collaborate on eA. The ENIGMA conference, the fifth in a series, was held in Canberra from 6 - 8 April, and was represented by 13 agencies across the 5 -eyes SIGINT/IA and HUMINT communities.
(U//FOUO) The U.S. delegation was led by
$\square$ Deputy Chief, NSA Threat Operations Center. She was joined by IA colleagues $\square$ and $\square$ and SID colleagues $\square$ and James Penrose. Two CIA and six FBI representatives also attended the conference.
(C) The conference gave me a chance to see the similarities and differences between the various countries' organizations. Of note was that every country is working to break down the barriers between their SIGINT and Information Assurance organizations, despite the difficulties with legalities and authorities. Surprisingly, each country also seemed to have similar issues with respect to communication within and between their own organizations to include infrastructure, policy and tradition.
(C ) Moreover, each is trying to foster better communication with their HUMINT organization. The consensus seemed to be that it is easier for the cryptologic organizations to share information among themselves than it is for the HUMINT agencies to share with each other, because they lack the history of the UKUSA partnership. Overall, communication between the various nations' cryptologic organizations seems to be good.
(U//FOUO) Coming from IAD (I333), this was a great opportunity for me to see SID-IAD cooperation up close and to witness first-hand the success of this collaboration. NSA seems to have already overcome many of the challenges with legalities and authorities with the blending of the Information Operations mission.
(U//FOUO) For me, the conference was a valuable experience. I saw in action the significant relationships NSA has with our 5 -eyes partners, and initiated new personal relationships, particularly with the New Zealand representatives. The meeting was well organized and the Australians were gracious hosts. It appears that Australian agencies have more flexible funding arrangements for hospitality; DSD and the Australian HUMINT agencies, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and the Australian Secret Information Service (ASIS), worked together to provide abundant snacks, meals and beverages each day. Our Australian hosts went the extra mile for their guests.
