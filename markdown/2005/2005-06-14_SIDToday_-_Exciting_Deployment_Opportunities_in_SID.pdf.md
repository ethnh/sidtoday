(U) Exciting Deployment Opportunities in SID
FROM:
SID Deployment Forum Executive Secretary
Run Date: 06/14/2005
(U//FOUO) Have you ever thought about volunteering for a short-term deployment? Well, now is a great time to stop thinking about it and do something! Deployments in support of the Global War on Terrorism are a high priority for the SIGINT Director. As proof, his Chief of Staff recently raised the level of membership on the SID Deployment Forum and asked them to take on the challenge of recruiting, recognizing, training (mission), and reassimilating volunteers.
(U)The SID Deployment Forum is chaired by Chief, S01, and has senior members (both civilian and military) from across the SIGINT Directorate.
(U//FOUO) The Forum is currently looking for volunteers to fill deployment positions up to 12 months in advance of deployment. So, even if you can't go right now, you can still volunteer for a position some time in the future. Forum members will work with you to determine the optimum position and time for you to deploy.
(U//FOUO) Watch SID today for announcements of recruitment events throughout the year. During these events we will have:

- Individuals who have returned from deployments to provide insight into what a volunteer can expect
- Senior Leadership (both civilian and military) to answer questions on support and recognition
- A Customer Gateway representative to answer questions regarding customer location openings and entitlements NDC representatives to answer questions regarding processing and incentives for civilian hostile deployments
- The SID Deployment Forum Executive Secretary to address any issues or concerns, and to answer questions regarding available deployment opportunities.
(U//FOUO) You can check out a partial list of deployment locations at the NSA Deployment Center (NDC) web page. Eventually, this web page will have a list of all
