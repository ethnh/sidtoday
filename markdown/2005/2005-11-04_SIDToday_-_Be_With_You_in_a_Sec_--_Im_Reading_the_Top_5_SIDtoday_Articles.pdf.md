(U//FOUO) Here at SID today, we keep an eye on the statistics to see which articles have the highest readership. Of course, the metrics aren't everything (we also look at written feedback to gauge what kinds of articles are of greatest interest), but they're still interesting. We've noticed that success stories --especially those that are war-related -- usually get the most attention.
(U) Without further ado, these were the five most widely read SID today articles during October (in order):

1. (S) How SIGINT Helped Liberate an American Hostage in Iraq
2. (S//SI) Is NSA Going Deaf? What Is "Golf Cart Reporting"? -- An Interview With MENA's Tony Loratto
3. (U) NSA's Oldest Third Party SIGINT Partnership
4. (S//SI) What SIGINT Revealed About the Egyptian Election
5. (U) Hiring: Let's All Help Scout Out the Best Talent to Work in SID
