(S//SI) CT Staff and Augmentees Focus on Bombings in Britain
FROM: Carl Johnson
SID/Deputy Director for Analysis \& Production (S2)
Run Date: 10/27/2005
(U//FOUO) Augmentees from across SID finish up 90-day tour in CT.
(S//SI) We all hope that when our friends need us, we will be able to lend a hand. When three terrorist bombs exploded on sovereign British soil on 7 July 2005, NSA was able to prove its ability to come through for one of its allies. What did we do? We jumped right in. The Counterterrorism Primary Production Center (CT PPC) diverted what resources it could to support the bombings-related surge of activity, but it couldn't do it all alone. That's when 22 analysts from across the SIGINT Directorate augmented the CT mission with the express purpose of exploiting data related to the London bombings.
(U//FOUO) For 90 days, these augmentees rose to the CT challenge, doing whatever was asked of them. Side-by-side with "permanent" CT experts, they triaged, processed, analyzed and reported huge volumes of information, seeking leads to the perpetrators and their backers. These augmentees were a critical component of CT's efforts to support GCHQ and the British community at large. This group of 22 analysts did a fabulous job! They are now returning to their former positions with the knowledge that when times got tough... they got going! They left not only with rich work experiences, but with the appreciation and admiration of their new CT colleagues.
(S//SI) The surge related to the London bombings may have come and gone, but the global terrorist threat is still very real. That's why the CT PPC was recently authorized a personnel plusup that has resulted in a lot of competitive selection vacancies. There are currently 29 vacancies out there, for people with a wide variety of skills and a desire to be part of the CT Team.
