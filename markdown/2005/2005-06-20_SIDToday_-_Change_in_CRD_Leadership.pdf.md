# (U) Change in CRD Leadership 

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 06/20/2005
(U//FOUO) I want to take this opportunity to wish $\square$ well in her new assignment as D/SUSLOL and to congratulate Charles Berlin on his new assignment as Deputy Director of Customer Relationships (DDCR), which was effective COB 10 June 2005.
(U//FOUO) The Customer Relationships Directorate is truly the cornerstone of SIGINT. Unless we are resigned to the production of SIGINT for the sake of SIGINT, we must have a complete understanding of what the nation needs from SIGINT. We rely on the CRD to help customers both understand how SIGINT can help them and help us understand their true needs. We can then focus the system appropriately to execute the mission.
(U) We are grateful to $\square$ for her leadership of the CRD for the past two years. Under her leadership, CRD has made transformational strides in the way NSA manages its customer relationships. She and Charles have set a course for CR that provides a foundation for the future. As the A/DDCR, Charles has been instrumental in our customer engagement strategy and will make a smooth transition into the DDCR role.
(U) Please join me in congratulating both $\square$ and Charles on their new endeavors.
