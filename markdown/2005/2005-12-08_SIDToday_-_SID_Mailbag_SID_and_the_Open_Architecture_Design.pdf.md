(U//FOUO) SID Mailbag: SID and the Open Architecture Design

(U//FOUO) What do SID analysts really think about the proposed work spaces of the future?
Question: (U//FOUO) For several months, I\&L has solicited input from analysts from all walks of SIGINT for the design of the new facility in Hawaii. Most of the analysts I know are horrified by the idea of working in spaces as open as the model indicated. Several analysts have expressed their concerns via the hrsocmodel webpage. There seems to be little indication that analysts' concerns are being taken into account in this design process.
(U//FOUO) It seems like somebody who knows nothing of intelligence production - especially language analysis - has been allowed to buy into the film portrayal of NSA and ignore a good portion of the practical issues which severely affect SIGINT production. How much influence does SID actually have in determining the kind of work environment for its analysts? Is it possible for you to provide statistics on the responses and comments from SID analysts so we can see what sort of response the design concept has received?

Answer: (U//FOUO) SID is heavily involved in the design of the new buildings for the Cryptologic Centers and has endorsed the open architecture concept because of its flexibility and enhanced ability for collaboration and teamwork. A SID Design Build Team -- comprising representatives from S1, S2, S3, SIGDEV, and the extended enterprise (including linguists, analysts, civilians, and military)-- is working closely with I\&L and the design consultants to ensure the operational spaces, watch areas, and labs in the new buildings provide an optimal environment for the analysts of the future.
(U) Statistics from the spring timeframe indicate that $75 \%$ of respondents to the HRSOC Design Concept Model Feedback Comment Summary were very supportive of the model's representation of a modern facility that represents a new way to conduct business. There was very strong support for the use of natural light and open space to support the collaborative environment that is shown in the model. $56 \%$ of respondents identified visual and audio distractions as a concern and $44 \%$ identified the lack of storage as a concern.
(U) These issues are being worked by the design teams as they progress through the various design phases for the new buildings. New furniture designs are being evaluated as well as acoustic materials for walls and ceilings. Noise cancellation headsets are already worn by our language analysts and will continue to be used in the new buildings. Plants, bookcases, rollaway whiteboards, and the like will also be part of the new design. These items will be used to mitigate any visual distractions while maintaining the flexibility needed in the workspace.
