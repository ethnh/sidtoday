(U//FOUO) PLUS is adding new features...
(U//FOUO) Have you read the feedback that your customers have written about your reports lately? Do you ever wonder where it comes from and how it gets into your mailbox? Customer feedback is accessible via PLUS (the Management Information System for SIGINT Production), along with Klieglights and Serialized Products (to name a few).
(U//FOUO) The PLUS Team in $\underline{\text { S111 }}$ and $\underline{\text { K921 }}$ will be releasing the newest version of PLUS in late September 2005. The new version contains many new features, enhancements and bug fixes. They include:

- Dynamic SKYCAST status messages will be displayed every 30 seconds on the PLUS Top Level Menu.
- New breakout fields have been added to the Statistics, Feedback and Klieglight Tools. You will also have the option to choose up to 10 breakouts, instead of the previous 5.
- New limiters have been added to the Statistics and Feedback tools.
- Query results for the Feedback, Statistics and Klieglight tools will default to a table format, instead of a graph format.
(U//FOUO) These are just a few of the many enhancements in the PLUS 5.6 release. The complete listing of the PLUS 5.6 release notes can be found at the following webpage:
