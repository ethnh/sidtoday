(S//SI) Can 'Motor City' Manufacture Some Arabic Language Assistance for NSA?

(S//SI) NSA is seeking Arabic linguists wherever they reside in the U.S. We've made a good start, but there's far to go.
(S//SI) Have you heard of the Detroit Global Language Center (DGLC)? It is located on Selfridge Army National Guard Base. This facility contains an NSA Reserve Mission Management secure enclave and Joint Reserve Intel Center (JRIC) SCIF**, which after the completion of renovations can accommodate a classified language processing operation with PL3** connectivity. Why should this mean anything to us here at NSAW? Let me explain.
(S//SI) Many of us are aware that NSA/CSS's ability to attract and hire Arabic language analyst applicants capable of beginning operational work continues to be a challenge. The Office of Recruitment and Staffing (MB) has focused its recruitment efforts on increasing the number of fully qualified Arabic language analysts hired and decreasing the need for language enhancement courses. While FY04 saw 30 direct placements into operations and 31 in FY05 the Arabic Senior Language Authority (SLA) reports that overall, the number of hired minimum level 2/2 Arabic linguists has declined by $41 \%$ since 2002. Although the number of applicants has increased, the quality of hires has decreased.
(S//SI) Because the Detroit area currently has the largest Arabic-speaking population in the United States, this past September representatives from the Office of Recruitment and Staffing (MB), NSA/CSS Georgia and the Senior Language Authority conducted a career invitational to attract potential Arabic linguist hires in Detroit for placement at the Detroit Global Language Center (DGLC.) Over 750 resumes were submitted. Following preliminary processing, 145 applicants were invited to take two placement exams. Forty-three applicants passed both tests, with an additional 10 passing one (those who passed one exam are being invited to retest on the 2nd exam).
(S//SI) The Associate Directorate for Security and Counterintelligence (Q2) is processing the candidates in the priority order provided by the SLA/Arabic, however, initial special source checks on the top 47 applicants have unearthed considerable issues. As a result of those checks, eight applicants have been removed from consideration and a number will require significant and lengthy investigation that may not sufficiently resolve the identified issues.
(S//SI) Currently, the JRIC Detroit SCIF, located on the second floor of the Naval Reserve Center on Selfridge, is undergoing Phase II renovations and is scheduled for completion by January 2006. Once complete, the SCIF's layout will meet minimum requirements for housing three separate groups of linguists:

- a central compartment with 10 TS//SI workstations are already in place,
- an outer compartment, accredited to TS/SI/TK/H/G, will accommodate 5 S//SI workstations and,
- an additional 5 SECRET-level workstations will be operational within the NRC's secure enclave on the 1st floor.

This configuration, incorporating a 4 -shift schedule, can accommodate up to 85 linguists, with 15 mission managers in support, bringing the total to 100 personnel. The DGLC SCIF will be equiped with NSANet connectivity and HIGHCASTLE voice processing/analysis \& reporting systems. When we identify the right people we will have a place for them to work.
(S//SI) While the career invitational was successful in identifying a large talent pool of potential
applicants, the Detroit initiative may not yield many hires. We will continue to review other sites to help satisfy this requirement. With continued cooperation among NSA/CSS's enablers and mission organizations including Eagle Alliance, Installations \& Logistics, Reseve Mission Management, and the Senior Language Authority we are sure to meet with success.
