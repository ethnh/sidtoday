(S//SI) Ambassador's visit a two-way street, as he gives a briefing on the situation in Colombia and is briefed on what SIGINT can do...
(S//SI) On 5 August 2005, Ambassador William Braucher Wood visited NSA/CSS Texas. Ambassador Wood is the U.S. Ambassador to Colombia and visited our site following his meeting with the President of the United States in Crawford, Texas. The Ambassador's visit was arranged and brokered by the Officer-in-Charge at SCS Bogota. This was the first time the Ambassador had visited the San Antonio site.
(S//SI) Ambassador Wood briefed site leadership on the environment in Colombia, which he described as changing daily. He provided depth and insight into the target worked here at NSA/CSS Texas, and shared his knowledge and expertise of the geographical area and local issues in Colombia. He stressed the importance of turning intelligence data around quickly; and relayed his belief that a piece of seemingly insignificant intelligence may actually be that critical missing piece. He stated that the challenge is turning actionable intelligence into action.
(S//SI) The Ambassador received a site tour, including an executive overview coupled with vignette briefings on specific aspects of targeting intelligence data. During the smaller sessions, he was provided the opportunity to don headsets and listen first hand to Spanish intercept. He met many military and civilian site personnel, and presented several Letters of Appreciation to key intelligence professionals working the Colombian target. He thanked NSA/CSS Texas for its support, enthusiasm, energy and quality of product, and urged us all to "...maintain the level of intensity (and)...keep up the pace..."
