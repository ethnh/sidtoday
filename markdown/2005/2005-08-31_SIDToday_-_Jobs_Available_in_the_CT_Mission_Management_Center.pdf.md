(S) As part of a continuing commitment to better posture the Signals Intelligence Directorate to fight and win the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), MG Quirk and I recently established the Counterterrorism Mission Management Center (CT MMC) -- a center envisioned to ensure that the NSA/CSS Extended Enterprise and partner resources are fully optimized, with operations synchronized across the USSS to disrupt and defeat terrorist organizations with global reach or transnational capabilities. SID is now fully engaged in identifying the right personnel to staff this critically important addition to the Enterprise's counterterrorism arsenal.
