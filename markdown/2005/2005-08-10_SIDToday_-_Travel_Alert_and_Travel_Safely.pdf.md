(U) Travel Alert and Travel Safely

FROM:
SID OPSEC (S02L3)
Run Date: 08/10/2005
(U) On 4 August, in response to ongoing security concerns, the State Department issued a Travel Advisory for the United Kingdom. In this advisory, all U.S citizens residing, visiting or transiting through the UK were advised to "... maintain a high level of vigilance, take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness and exercise caution in public places or while using public transportation." It was issued in direct response to the recent terrorist bombings in London as well as ongoing threat indicators.
(U) While this particular advisory deals directly with the current situation in the UK, we'd like to use it as chance to remind all Agency employees that they should be alert, aware and smart whenever they are out and about, be it at home or while on leave, TDY or PCS. At this time of year, we have many of our folks traveling around the world in one capacity or another and we want to remind all to keep what you've learned about OPSEC (Operations Security) and personal security in mind at all times. Practice good situational awareness and don't hesitate to look or question something two, three or more times if it doesn't look or feel "just right."
