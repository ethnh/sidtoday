(U) SID Articulates Its Language Training Policy

FROM
Deputy Chief, SIGINT Policy (S02L1)
Run Date: 09/21/2005
(U) Yesterday we published a message from MG Quirk reiterating the need for language analysts to undergo 4 - 8 weeks of training by next March. Here's the policy directive to back it up:
(U) The acquisition and maintenance of foreign language skills has never been more important to the SIGINT Directorate (SID) than it is today! SID Management Directive 413, "Significant Cryptologic Language Training Events (SCLTEs) for Cryptologic Language Analysts," is an important step toward meeting SID's needs in this area.
(U) The Directive, which was signed on 25 August 2005, codifies the March 2004 Signals Intelligence Director Memorandum, " Cryptologic Language Readiness " and confirms that language analysts are expected to continually acquire, maintain and upgrade their mission foreign language skills through training, education, experience and self-development in order to meet the demands of the SIGINT mission. This requirement pertains to all NSA/CSS civilian and military language analysts, including those in the SIGINT Extended Enterprise and field-deployed elements within the USSS.
(U) In order to fulfill this requirement, language analysts must complete 160 hours of training over a 24-month period that began with the March 2004 Signals Intelligence Director memorandum. Ideally, they should attend one single, continuous, foreign language training activity that entails at least 160 hours of cryptologic foreign language study. However, due to mission requirements, it may be acceptable for analysts to break the training into smaller modules in order to strike a balance between the 160 -hour mandate and mission requirements.
(U) Activities that may satisfy this training requirement include:

1. Attendance in formal platform courses;
2. Attendance in structured language immersion programs;
3. Enrollment in Directed Language Studies;
4. Enrollment in National Cryptologic School (NCS) Computer-Based Language Training (CBLT);
5. Teaching or developing language training at level $2+$ or higher;
6. Attendance in Area Studies and Language Speaker Series presentations;
7. Developing Defense Language Proficiency Test 5 (DLPTS) Systems tests;
8. Participating in the validation of DLPT5 System tests;
9. Attendance in English as a Second Language (ESL) courses;
10. Enrollment in Independent Language Studies;
11. Other language training activities approved by the Director, Language Analysis Skill Community.
(U) To the greatest extent possible, language analysts will be given opportunities to accomplish the required objectives during regular duty hours. The NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority (SLA), the Director, Language Analysis Skill Community (LASC), the Language Training
Investment Board (LTIB), Language Training Representatives (LTRs), Language Advisors, managers and supervisors will be available to provide analysts with guidance and mentoring as needed.
(U) Please review SID Management Directive 413 for further details!
