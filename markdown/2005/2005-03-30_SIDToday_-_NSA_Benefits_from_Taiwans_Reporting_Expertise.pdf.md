Taiwan supplying NSA with in-depth, long-term analysis on the PRC (TS//SI)
(TS//SI) As NSA analysts working the Chinese military problem will tell you, getting a handle on the rapid modernization of the world's largest army is a daunting task. Fortunately, NSA analysts now have a new and significant tool in their SIGINT toolbox to aid them -- courtesy of Third Party partner Taiwan.
(TS//SI) For years, Taiwan's has been a reliable producer of "one-off" activity reports on the PRC military. In the wake of the November "Joint Analytic Conference" at KRSOC* and a December 2004 visit to NSA by committed to begin providing NSA with term/trend analysis reporting on the People's Liberation Army (PLA). During the first two months of the year, has made good on this commitment by providing over 50 term/analytic reports that run the gamut of PRC military issues. Several reports have been turned around to NSA customers, generating much response.
(TS//SI) It is also interesting to note that, while $\square$ reporting practices is intended to improve satisfaction of customers' requirements, it also represents a culture change. The analytic reports do not contain Signals Related Information (SRI) and thus give greater protection to sources and methods while providing customers with the full benefit of $\square$ impressive analytic expertise. Furthermore, because of her efforts of recent years to familiarize Taiwan SIGINT reporters with NSA's reporting philosophy, SID's $\square$ shares credit for this unfolding success.
