(U//FOUO) Video to Your Desktop (repost)

News reports on target countries are available at your desktop (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) Advanced Intelligence Research Services (AIRS), NSA's agent for non-SIGINT information acquisitions and management, brings a new capability to you -- video at your desktop! If a picture is worth a thousand words, then one that moves could be worth a million! Every day more and more information is being provided solely in video -- the likelihood of this video containing information to confirm, clarify, or enhance the SIGINT fact is clearly too great to ignore.
(U//FOUO) Although AIRS' Time Sensitive Information Support Branch (TSIS) initially developed this capability to support NSOC, we realized it would also be valuable to Product Line analysts as well as other Agency customers. Video provides up-to-date news on target countries and subjects. It can be used in voice identification as well as to provide tip-offs to SIGINT indications about events. In addition, foreign language video news broadcasts can be used by linguists, enabling them to stay proficient in their foreign language and stay abreast of news airing in the foreign country.
(U//FOUO) So how do you get this resource into your arsenal? The TSIS publishes a daily Video News Summary (VNS) which describes the most recent news segments on our website. These descriptions are linked with the video footage so that you can view the actual video at your desktop. To get started go to:
"go video-news"). Click on the date you would like to see, then select the news story of interest by clicking on the VNS Segment number.
(U//FOUO) Although TSIS resides in SID as part of Analysis and Production, our charter is corporate and we serve not only SID, but also the entire Agency. We provide video to the Office of Public Affairs, the NSOC Senior Operations Officer, and the SID Cryptologic Insecurities team whenever NSA or any reference to cryptologic information disclosures is mentioned in the news. Information from these videos is then used to brief the Director and Agency Seniors. The Information Assurance Directorate, the Research and Development Directorate, the National Cryptologic School, and Security are also some of our major users.
