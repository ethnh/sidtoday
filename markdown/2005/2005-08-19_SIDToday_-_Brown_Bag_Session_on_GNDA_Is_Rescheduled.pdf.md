(U) Brown Bag Description:
(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities. A brief abstract of planned presentation is below:
(TS//SI) Now in existence for one year, the Global Network Development Activity (GNDA) will provide a brief overview of its activities, to include some accomplishments. The GNDA stood up in July 2004 with the goal of closing the SIGDEV gap for cable accesses and cross-site SIGINT Development. A place, not an organization, GNDA provides an environment for experimentation in technique development and automation. Discussion will also include an outline of analytic impediments in optimizing our cable access programs and some recommendations for closing those gaps.
