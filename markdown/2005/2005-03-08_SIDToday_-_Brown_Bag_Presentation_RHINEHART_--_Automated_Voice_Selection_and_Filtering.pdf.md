(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe these sessions are of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities.
(U//FOUO) This month's featured speaker is $\square$ from SSG/Operation Orchestration.

## Presentation summary :

(U//FOUO) RHINEHART is a project that addresses a significant challenge facing the SIGINT community: how to effectively isolate voice communications of interest from vast amounts of collection. RHINEHART is an exploration and prototyping effort that introduces commercial- and government-developed automated voice selection and filtering solutions into an operational SIGINT environment. The goal is to decrease the amount of time a language analyst spends listening to traffic and increase time spent on evaluating and reporting traffic of intelligence value.
(U//FOUO) This brown bag session will discuss RHINEHART prototype capabilities, initial testing results and feedback, and where the effort is headed this year. In addition, a live web-enabled demonstration of the capability will be provided at the end of the session. Please join us as SIGDEV explores ways to narrow the linguist resource gap that face NSA and the intelligence community.
