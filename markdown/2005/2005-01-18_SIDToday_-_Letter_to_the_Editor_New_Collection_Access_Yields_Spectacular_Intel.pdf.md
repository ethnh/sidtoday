(TS//SI) Here's some feedback on the recent article on new access to an Indian net :

From:
ITIS Senior Technical Advisor
Comment: (S//SI) The relevance [of this article] for me is that our office (ITIS) is responsible for obtaining Joint Staff/CINC tier approvals for DSCS [Defense Satellite Communications System] comms between INDRA and Hawaii. This kind of result, when presented to these senior reps who approve our comms requirements, help justify current and future comms needs... Excellent example of what NSA is doing with the comms at INDRA, in particular a recent 2Mbs comms link expansion to handle these types of increased mission needs... Thanks.
