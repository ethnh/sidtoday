# (C) SID Support to the US Coast Guard 

FROM:

(C) The Signals Intelligence Directorate has supported the USCG for many years and looks forward to an even more robust relationship now that the Coast Guard is an SCE (Service Cryptologic Element) and SID partner. As you could imagine, in the post 9/11 world, information on threats, particularly those against U.S. maritime borders, ports, or the nation's waterways is of the highest interest to the USCG. The USCG uses ELINT and Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) information currently provided by the MATCHLIGHT database to help identify threats to the U.S. in the form of maritime vessels or cargos. This database is maintained by SID's Maritime Analysis Cell, and contains all SEI information received-- whether collected by moving platforms or by eyes-on-target at maritime choke points. USCG may also use this information, fused with other USCG data, to pursue its domestic and law enforcement missions.
(C) We can trace the beginnings of the SID-Coast Guard interaction to around 1989 when the USCG, as a member of the Joint Interagency Task Force-West (JIATF-West, located at Coast Guard Island in Alameda, CA) first received signals intelligence support. This support took the form of SANDKEY reporting, which includes Narclites, tippers, and HFDF (High Frequency Direction Finding) information from MRSOC and other SANDKEY participants. This data is used to identify and locate narcotics traffickers and their shiploads of narcotics so they can be detained and/or arrested and their illegal cargo seized. In an example from late June 2003, SID's Commercial Ship Tracking Cell in Denver provided tracking support to GCHQ, JIATF-South (in Key West, Florida), and the USCG that led to the HMS IRON DUKE's seizure of a drugcarrying cargo ship north of Venezuela. This ship contained 3,930 kilos of pure cocaine with a New York City street value of $\$ 196,500,000$.
(C) SID also provides the USCG intelligence in the form of serialized SIGINT product reporting on a wide variety of subjects, including counterterrorism, alien smuggling, counternarcotics, maritime tracking of vessels and/or high-interest cargos and international civilian maritime activities. We look forward to even closer collaboration with our USCG partners in future, and wish them a happy birthday! (See related story in NSA Daily.)
