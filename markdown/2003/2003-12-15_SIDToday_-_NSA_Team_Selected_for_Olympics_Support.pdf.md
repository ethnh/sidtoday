(S//SI) Preparations and training for the Olympics continue across the extended NSA enterprise as we bring together U.S. resources and those of our foreign SIGINT partners. Scenarios are being drafted to support EUCOM and SOCOM exercises in March, as well as exercises with the SIGINT Seniors nations. These foreign partners (i.e. Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the U.S.) will use the SIGDASYS communications network to send scripted information to Athens in a communications exercise during the above exercises. NSA will round out the exercise phase with another communications exercise utilizing the resources of all 36 foreign partners.
(S) The entire U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) has come together in one team environment to provide information to both U.S. Government and the Government of Greece (GOG) customers. The co-location of IC analysts both at the U.S. Embassy Athens as well as at the Greek National Intelligence Service greatly enhances information sharing across the IC and provides timely and useful information to the front end. NSA will continue to be a major contributor to that joint IC effort as we head for the finish line.
