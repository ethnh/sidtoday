(U//FOUO) GCCS-I3 Delivers Iraq Intelligence Picture to NSA
FROM:
National Tactical Integration Office
Run Date: 08/11/2003
(U//FOUO) A critical issue facing the Agency as we prepared to support Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) was how to gain near real-time visibility into U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) operations. Our ability to view the battle space from a USCENTCOM perspective was key to keeping the cryptologic system in step with rapidly changing operations. The answer in a nutshell... Global Command and Control System- Integrated Imagery and Intelligence or GCCSI3.

# What is GCCS-I3? 

(U//FOUO) GCCS is the primary command and control system for Joint Force Commanders at the Joint Task Force level and above. It presents the Common Operational Picture (COP) to these forces. GCCS-I3 expands GCCS capability by adding a tightly integrated set of intelligence applications and tools. GCCS-I3 applications and tools build the intelligence portion of the COP by integrating the tactical track picture with intelligence reference data from the Military Intelligence Data Base (MIDB). By providing all source integrated intelligence data to the GCCS COP, these tools produce a Common Intelligence Picture (CIP), the theater's all-source, mapbased picture depicting the current USCENTCOM battlespace. GCCS-I3 receives, processes, displays, and maintains current geolocational information on threat, neutral and friendly land, sea, and air forces, resulting in an unprecedented level of streamlined intelligence to support operations.

## Key NSA Players Use GCCS-I3 to Support OIF

(U//FOUO) The Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD) National Tactical Integration Office (NTIO) installed GCCS-I3 workstations at critical nodes throughout NSA to support OIF. From the Director's Large Conference room to the NSOC Iraqi Battle Bridge, GCCS-I3 provided key situational awareness information to Agency decision makers.
(U//FOUO) The "Battle Bridge" depended on GCCS-I3 for theater-wide Blue Force locations and the corresponding intelligence picture. With unprecedented visibility into USCENTCOM operations via GCCS-I3, the Battle Bridge could quickly focus cryptologic support wherever needed. The end result was greatly improved force protection and targeting support to coalition forces throughout the campaign. The Battle Bridge also relied heavily on GCCS-I3 to prepare the daily Iraq Battle Book and Campaign Update briefings to Senior Agency Management.
(U//FOUO) Other organizations, including the Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC), the NSOC Blue Force Cell, and the Targeting Supporting Activity, relied on GCCS-I3 for critical information. GCCS-I3 performed a synchronizing function among these and other diverse organizations by baselining information upon which decisions were based. The CSRC, for example, was able to quickly tailor collection strategies based on up-to-the-minute knowledge of USCENTCOM operations. The result was more effective use of the SIGINT system and better support to the warfighter.

## (U) In the Fight...

(U//FOUO) Based on the success of GCCS-I3 during OIF, the NTIO is working with NSOC to provide worldwide GCCS-I3 coverage, including full integration of Integrated Broadcast Service (IBS) support. By providing visibility into the tactical battlespace, GCCS-I3 greatly increases the relevance of SIGINT to the warfighter at every level. SIGINT is no longer thought of as a supporting function, but rather, is fully integrated into the campaign from planning through execution. For further information, contact www.igINT.com
