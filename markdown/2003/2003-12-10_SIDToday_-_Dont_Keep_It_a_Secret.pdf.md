(U//FOUO) If you are a regular SID today reader, you have seen many postings of upcoming seminars, speeches, conferences, etc. that are available to the workforce. Did you know that you, too, can have an announcement posted (if space permits) for an upcoming event that you would like to publicize?
(U//FOUO) SID today averages about 50,000 visits to our homepage per month... that's a lot of visibility! Take advantage of it the next time you want to get the word out - contact SIGINT Communications.
(U//FOUO) Note: Regretfully, we cannot post retirement or other social functions. A page is available for such announcements, however. See the Social Functions Webpage for further info.
