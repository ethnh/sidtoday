# (U) Kudos from CENTCOM 

FROM: BG Barbara Fast
CJTF-7 J2 (Director of Intelligence)
Run Date: 09/29/2003
(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: The following message was sent to the Director, NSA on September 24th:
(S//SI) For the past three weeks, CJTF-7 has executed OPERATIONS MCCLELLAN and GRIERSON in Western Iraq to capture or kill Sunni extremist/foreign fighters/terrorists transiting into Iraq. The cumulative success of these operations is specifically attributed to VOICESAIL reporting/geolocation information provided by the National Security Agency, GRSOC, and Mission Ground Stations (MGS). Your collective efforts have been noteworthy. From the remote front ends of the PROPHET-HAMMERS to the GRSOC's TSA and Cobra Focus sanctuary to Iraqi OPIs at NSAW - we are all in the fight together. The seamless National Tactical Integrated Cryptologic Support Plan in support of OIF Phase IV is a resounding success - thanks to the many cryptologic professionals who are in the OEF/OIF fight.
(S//SI) Also, while not tied to this operation, I want to highlight the great and timely reporting of your UN shop on topics of key interest. They have allowed us to shape the issues, vice react to them.
(S//SI) SIGINT is and will continue to make a very significant difference in the Iraqi Theater of Operations (ITO) to help achieve our endstate - emergence of a stable and safe democratic Iraqi government and to bring all of our troops home safely.
(S//SI) Please accept my thanks and respect for a job well done. As we work to build a selfgoverning, viable Iraq, we continue our campaign to rid Iraq of former Iraqi leaders (FRL), foreign fighters/mujahadin, Sunni extremists, Ansar Islam extremists (AI), Muhammed's Army and others who seek to oppose our efforts through violent means.
