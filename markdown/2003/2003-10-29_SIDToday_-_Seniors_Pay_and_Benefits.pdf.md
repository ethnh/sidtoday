Run Date: 10/29/2003
(U) This is the final in a three-part series.
(U) What Are the DISES/DISL Pay Scales?
(U//FOUO) For specific salary information on DISES, DISL, and the General Scale, see HERE .
(U) What Other Benefits Come With the Job?
(U//FOUO) Some of the benefits to being a senior are:

## Leave

- DISES can accrue and carry over up to 720 hours of annual leave from year to year.
- DISLs annual leave accrual remains at 240 hours (up to 360, if accrued in the field).


## Awards Eligibility

- They can be nominated for and receive Presidential Rank awards: the Distinguished Presidential Rank award is 35\% of base pay and the Meritorious Presidential Rank award is 20\% of base pay.


## Bonuses

- DISES are eligible for bonuses that can range from a minimum of $5 \%$ of base pay to $20 \%$ of base pay.
- DISL employees are eligible for bonuses that can range from a minimum of $5 \%$ of base pay up to $\$ 25,000$.
(U) No federal employee may be paid more than ES Level 1, or $\$ 171,900$, during any calendar year. For additional pay limitations please see HERE .
(U) Besides the Salary, How is DISES/DISL Different from being a GS Employee?
(U//FOUO) Seniors receive higher salaries than GS employees, but they also sacrifice certain benefits that GS personnel enjoy. For example, seniors do not have the same level of job security as GS workers - they can more easily be dismissed (by the Director) if their skills are not needed. In addition, seniors do not receive benefits such as extra pay for overtime work. Even if seniors work 60 hours a week (which is not unusual), they are paid for only 40.
(U//FOUO) DISES are not eligible for credit hours, time off awards, star awards, premium pay, or comp time except for religious purposes. (DISLs may receive credit hours, up to maximum of 24.) In addition, seniors have increased professional liability, and are required to submit financial disclosure statements.
