(U//FOUO) A Graduate's View of the ICSLP Class

FROM:
Chief of SIGINT Requirements
Run Date: 07/10/2003
(U//FOUO) For three weeks in June I had the privilege to be a member of the Intelligence Community Senior Leadership Program (ICSLP) class. This class is sponsored by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and is intended to bring together senior executives from across the intelligence community to examine and discuss major issues affecting national security decision making, intelligence strategies, interoperability, and intelligence support to the nation. Our class also included for the first time a member of the Secret Service as a consumer of intelligence and the class had the very good fortune to be mentored by 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Leaving the class I had a far greater appreciation for the amazing things being accomplished throughout the intelligence community, developed many friendships and contacts across the community, and better understood some of my own individual responsibilities in the big picture of things.
(U//FOUO) The only downside to the class was that I had to wait 20 years to get this opportunity, one which should be offered far earlier in every employee's career.
