# (C) Collection Facility Goes Low-Profile on Okinawa 

FROM: SIGINT Communications
Unknown
Run Date: $12 / 15 / 2003$
(C) CAMELUS is the NSA coverterm for the Japanese-funded effort to relocate NSA's Hanza Okinawa Remoted Collection Facility (RCF) and its support activities to a location 25 kilometers north, to an area known as Landing Zone Ostrich in the Okinawa Central Training Area (CTA) on USMC Camp Hansen. Why the move? The relocation will shift the highly visible facility from a populated area to a more "low-profile" setting, in accordance with the wishes of the local Okinawa population. When CAMELUS is up and running, the mission at Hanza will be shut down, its mission equipment removed and reutilized elsewhere. The Japanese Government plans to raze the Hanza site and return the land to the original owners after we've moved.

The existing antenna array at Hanza.
(C//SI) While the Hanza RCF employs a circa 1960 Circularly Disposed Antenna Array (CDAA) sometimes likened to an "elephant cage" - for HF collection (above), the CAMELUS antenna will be smaller, with a lower profile, PUSHER-like antenna. The Japanese Government is paying for all civil work, construction, utilities hookups, and replication of the SIGINT mission-systems. The cost is estimated to be well over $\$ 150$ million. CAMELUS will provide SID with not only a new collection facility, but also a state-of-the-art HF collection system called STAKECLAIM, a functional replacement for the existing systems at Hanza (LANCER/GRN, TIDY TIPS III, LONGROOT HFDF, and MEDIATOR).

Entire site - Landing Zone Ostrich.
(C) CAMELUS Facility construction began on the new site in the spring of 2003. SIGINT Mission system installation and testing will start in the July/Aug 2004 and the current acceptance-date is planned for December 2004.
