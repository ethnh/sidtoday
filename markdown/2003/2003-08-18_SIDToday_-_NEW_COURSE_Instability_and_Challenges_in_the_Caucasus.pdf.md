FROM: SIGINT Communications Unknown
Run Date: 08/18/2003
(U) NSA and the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Advanced International Studies, in a joint collaboration, will present a 3 day seminar titled "Instability and Challenges in the Caucasus". The seminar will be presented in the FANX 2 Auditorium on 16, 17\&18 September from 0800-1600. See registration details below.

# Course Description: 

(U/FOUO) This seminar will explore threats to stability in the South Caucasus and to U.S. interests in this region. Strategically located on the crossroads of Europe and Asia, the Caucasus is plagued by a complex set of interlinked challenges to security. These include unresolved political and ethnic conflicts, internal threats such as state weakness, looming successions and increasing organized crime. These are exacerbated by external factors, especially the roles of neighboring powers. The region's importance is underlined by significant energy resources. The seminar will conclude by considering America's interests in the region and how it might effectively pursue them.
(U) JHU will conduct 2 days of unclassified presentations, and the SINIOs/NCS will organize classified presentations by government officials on the third day.
