(S//SI) The UN Security Council: (SIGINT) History Repeats Itself!
FROM: $\square$ NSA Representative to the U.S. Mission to the UN
Run Date: $10 / 30 / 2003$
(S//SI) Once again SIGINT has made a crucial difference in the U.S.' ability to shepherd a UN Security Council Resolution through the UNSC. On 16 October the Council unanimously passed UNSCR 1511, which provided a UN mandate for Iraq reconstruction and peacekeeping and opened the way for UN member countries to contribute troops and money to the effort. Passage of the Resolution had been given urgent priority by top U.S. officials (who wanted it in place before a donors' conference for Iraq on 23-24 October), and its rescue - from what seemed to be certain death just a week before the vote - has been hailed as a triumph of diplomacy and a key turning point for the situation in Iraq.
(TS//SI) However, as with UNSCR 1441 (return of weapons inspectors to Iraq) last November, passage of 1511 was at heart a triumph of SIGINT support. From the Resolution's initial introduction in the UNSC in early September until the 16 October vote, NSA played a key role in keeping U.S. policy makers in New York and Washington abreast (or ahead) of the many twists and turns in the marathon negotiations. Reporting from across SID (especially from the UN, Chinese, Russian, French, German, Syrian, Pakistani, and Mexican diplomatic shops) provided a window into the planning and intentions of the principal players on the Council - and may have even provided the Secretary of State and the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN with the key information needed to ensure the unanimous vote.
(S//SI) Kudos for NSA reporting followed almost immediately after the vote. The U.S. Mission to the UN's expert adviser on Iraq probably spoke for a number of customers at State and USUN by stating,
"I don't think any of us should overlook - or underestimate - the critical role [NSA] played in getting us to the finish line. The timely products that you provided to us in a constant stream were critical in shifting the balance, particularly with the Chinese and Russians, and allowed us to make tactical decisions real time with Secretary Powell that had the effect of isolating the French and Germans as we saw the others peel off one by one. For obvious reasons [NSA] doesn't get the public praise, but they should know how much more effective and more successful they allow us to be. It's one of the real reasons, beyond luck, that we are the best at what we do."
(U) Job well done, indeed!
