(U) A Call to Alms

FROM:
CFC Senior Keyworker for SID
Run Date: 11/17/2003
(U) As the SID Senior Keyworker for this year's Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), I'd like to take a moment to thank those of you who have contributed so far this year, and encourage those of you who are still considering your contribution. In addition, I would like to recognize and thank all the SID Keyworkers, canvassers and coordinators for the job you do daily within your respective organizations.
(U) As you may know, NSA is the largest contributor to CFC in Central Maryland, an accomplishment of which our workforce can be proud. Last year, NSA gave $\$ 1,369,836.40$ to the CFC; SID contributed \$581,179.06 of that amount. What's even more noteworthy: only 20\% of the Agency workforce (and 17\% of the SID workforce) participated in the 2002 Campaign. That's a lot of money from a relatively small percentage of our population. NSA's goal this year is $\$ 1,400,000$ and a $25 \%$ participation rate. So far, we've received $\$ 1,155,269.25$ in pledges. We need your contribution to meet our Agency goal, but, far more important, the people and causes that benefit from the Campaign rely on your contribution every day. Your gift makes a significant difference towards improving the lives of many individuals and the world around us.
(U) There are many, many causes that need our support-- the list of CFC recipients is long and there is something for everyone. Whatever your charitable interest-- children, the elderly, hospice care, homeless shelters, domestic violence, nature conservation, welfare-to-work programs, pets on wheels, or perhaps a disease that has touched you or a loved one... it's all there in CFC.
(U) I invite you all to take a look at the CFC homepage ("go cfc"). Civilian personnel can set up payroll deduction from this page-- this is relatively painless way to give-- but CFC also accepts donations in the form of cash or check. (Military personnel may participate in NSA's CFC through one-time cash or check donation, however their payroll deductions have to go through their branch of service.) We'll even reward you just for contributing-- with either a print, paperweight, first aid kit, or key chain flashlight, depending on your level of giving. While you're on the website, check out the Top 10 Reasons to Give, the Shape Count game, and the End of Campaign drawing.
(U) As Thanksgiving approaches, most of us have much to be grateful for-- family, friends, employment, health, or maybe a new car or a vacation to look forward to. As we celebrate and give thanks for our bounty, take some time to consider those less fortunate who benefit from all the wonderful causes the CFC supports. NSA needs YOU to help reach our goal of $\$ 1,400,000$. Please go on-line or contact your CFC representative and Make your donation today! THANK YOU!
