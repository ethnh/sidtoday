(U//FOUO) Latest SID Leadership Offsite: Seeing the Big Picture
FROM: SIGINT Communications

(U//FOUO) In early August, MG Quirk convened the SID Leadership Team for a two-day offsite, their third offsite meeting in recent months. This gathering was dedicated to understanding the authorities and responsibilities delegated to SID by the DIRNSA. MG Quirk emphasized to the group that we - SID - are responsible to DIRNSA for the operation of the entire U.S. SIGINT System (USSS). In the past, we've not always taken such a broad view of our responsibilities, but we must grow into this job.
(U//FOUO) Where to begin? As a start, the leaders set out to identify their most significant responsibilities. Keep in mind that part of taking responsibility for SID's strategic direction means enabling tactical decisions to be made at specified lower levels, by those who are most familiar with the specific issues. Through this initial discussion, they concluded that SID's responsibilities include:

- Optimize SIGINT Value for Customers
- Guide the Building of the USSS Workforce for Tomorrow
- Develop and Acquire SIGINT Systems for NSA and Support such Development and Acquisition across the USSS
- Plan and Program for Future SIGINT Capabilities
- Synchronize Current Operations of the SIGINT System
- Execute NSA, IC, \& DoD Corporate Responsibilities
(U//FOUO) Perhaps most surprising was the degree of SID responsibility for SIGINT excellence across the entire US SIGINT System. Executing those broad responsibilities as part of a collaborative SIGINT team can yield great results for all members, and may be our greatest challenge.
(U//FOUO) Additional offsites will be conducted to further define high- and lower-level responsibilities. What's to be gained by all this effort? The result of this process will be to help everyone in SID recognize the breadth of their responsibilities and allow them to understand clearly their role in the USSS "big picture". This should, in turn, bring cohesiveness to our business methods and reflect in the quality of our product. The end goal remains: to provide the best possible SIGINT to enlighten the nation's decision-makers.
