(U) This is the second in a three-part series.
(U//FOUO) There are two ways a person can become a senior at NSA:

1. by elevation from within NSA through the periodic Executive/Technical Selection Board process; or
2. by selection for hire for an advertised position when the individual has standardized executive qualifications that warrant appointment as a DISES or DISL.
(U//FOUO) Each executive category has its own selection criteria, as follows:
(U) DISES Criteria
(U//FOUO) To become a member of DISES, one must be competent to assume leadership responsibilities in a broad variety of work positions throughout the Executive Service. Candidates for DISES must have knowledge, experience, and potential in the following five OPM "Executive Core Qualifications":

- Leading Change
- Leading People
- Results Driven
- Business Acumen
- Building Coalitions/Communication
(U//FOUO) Each of these OPM five criteria has several sub elements. See HERE for full details.


## (U) DISL Criteria

(U//FOUO) The DISL criteria, by contrast, revolve around a candidate's accomplishments in a specialized field and/or expertise, professional stature, and the candidate's impact on Agency's operations. There are four DISL criteria:

- Technical/Professional Achievements
- Technical/Professional Development of Others
- Technical/Professional Leadership/Decision Making
- Continued Technical/Professional Development

(U) Who Nominates and Selects People for DISES/DISL?
(U//FOUO) Heads of directorates nominate individuals for potential elevation. The authority to appoint seniors is delegated to the Director NSA from the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). At the Director's discretion, the Executive/Technical Selection Board is convened to review the nominations received from the directorates

(U) How Are Senior Assignments Made?
(U//FOUO) Many positions are advertised via NSA/Executive Programs. The few that are not are forwarded to the Director, Executive Programs, with some rationale as to why the position cannot be advertised, a list of individuals who were reviewed for the position, and the reasons the person is being 'slated' as the best person for the position. The Director, Executive Programs will then consult with the D/DIR and the Director for a final decision. The Director or Deputy Director make all decisions on reassignments of DISES/DISL personnel.
