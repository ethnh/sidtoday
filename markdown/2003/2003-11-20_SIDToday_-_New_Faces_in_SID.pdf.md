# (U) Our Future is Now 

(U) For the first time in over a decade more people are joining the NSA workforce than leaving it. Did you know that the SIGINT Directorate hired 472 new employees in FY03? Existing hiring levels are expected to continue to increase!
(U) Those of you who have been here for a while and are experienced employees have probably noticed many of the new faces. It's been many years since we've had the opportunity to welcome, train and mentor so many new people. You may not realize how valuable your knowledge and experience are to the future of our SIGINT mission. In truth, what you do to help our current generation of employees can be just as vital to our mission as the knowledge and skills that you use to serve your country each and every day. We have the unique opportunity to share our ideals, knowledge, and visions with the future SIGINT workforce!
(U) Those of you who are newly hired employees don't need anyone to tell you what it is like to be new to NSA. You are living the experience. The NSA culture and environment may be unlike anything you have ever encountered in your career. Perhaps there are some things you can do to help make your transition to our great organization easier.

## (U) How can all employees help each other during this time of transition?

(U) Both managers and colleagues alike can make a tremendous impact on our new employees. Taking a moment to welcome them and find out about their past experiences and current expectations can make a big difference in their initial impression of NSA. While mentoring is a meaningful and effective way to bring a new employee into the organization, it shouldn't be a substitute for on-going encouragement, open communication, and the continuous sharing of information. Be open to the ideas of these new and enthusiastic team members. Their energy can be a wonderful complement to our existing environment. Part of their initial contribution will be their fresh perspective.
(U) In fact, new employees should ask numerous questions and offer many ideas! As a new hire, remember the virtue of patience. There are many new things to learn and to understand. Many of your ideas are excellent; however, it may take time to see them come to fruition. Absorb as much knowledge from your co-workers as you can. The lessons that can be learned from your co-workers may prove invaluable to you as you begin your career at NSA. It just may surprise you as to where they have been and what they have accomplished during their careers here!
(U) SIGINT is a success story that is continuously adapting and ever changing. With each passing moment, we impact that story and affect its ultimate outcome. Let's ensure our continued success by learning and growing together. Recognizing and appreciating our vast experiences and backgrounds is a big part of this effort. By working together, our impressive past will become our successful future!
