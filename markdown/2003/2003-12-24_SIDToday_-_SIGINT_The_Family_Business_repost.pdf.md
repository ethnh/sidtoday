(U) SIGINT: The Family Business (repost)

(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: This article appeared on December 4th.
(U) Working at a field site often gives you the feeling that your coworkers are like a second family. It has certainly seemed that way for me in my three short years as an NSA employee. But, for many of us, our coworkers actually are our family, too. In my case, my father has been an agency employee for the past 30+ years. Although I started out believing my situation to be a rather unusual one, I've come to realize that this is much more prevalent than I once thought.
(U) NSA has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, even though my dad was never able to share any details about what he did for a living. When I was very young, and asked him why there were giant golf balls on top of the building, he told me that it was because he worked in a golf ball factory. I can't believe I fell for that one! Now that I've been hired by the agency, I have a more accurate understanding of the world to which my father disappeared every day and what actually goes on behind those reflective windows of the headquarters building.
(U) When I started my career, I often wondered what people would think if they found out my "family secret" - that my dad worked at the agency, too. What a surprise it was to find out from practically day one that so many other employees are related to one another, too! It became something of interest to me to take note of how many husband and wives, sisters and brothers, children and parents, etc. actually are employed by NSA. One coworker's father, mother, stepfather and brother all work at the Agency.
(U) After celebrating NSA's 50th Anniversary, I have realized that not only does NSA have a long and proud history, but also that my family is a part of that history. I'll never grow tired of the "Are you any relation to $\qquad$ ?" question because I realize there is a legacy to carry on. And someday I may also be able to proudly tell my children, "It's because I work in a golf ball factory."
(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: Are you also part of a multi-generational NSA family? Are there any third-generation NSA'ers out there? If so, we'd like to hear your story!
