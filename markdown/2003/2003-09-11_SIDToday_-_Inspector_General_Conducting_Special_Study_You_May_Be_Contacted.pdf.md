Run Date: 09/11/2003
(U//FOUO) The NSA Office of Inspector General has announced a Special Study to be conducted starting this month, as requested by DIRNSA, on "Corporate-Level Functions Within Mission/Support Elements." The primary objective of this study will be to determine how well the Agency has met the Director's intent to consolidate corporate functions under centralized corporate sponsors - Associate Directors and Chief of Staff (to include Principal Directors) - as announced in October 2000.
(U//FOUO) To accomplish this, the NSA OIG will review how various corporate functions are being executed throughout the Agency by the following criteria:

- identifying Agency (to include SID) organizations that conduct corporate functions outside of corporate sponsors and
- determining if the structure and alignment of those organizations are consistent with DIRNSA's intent.
(U//FOUO) The study will involve an examination of missions and functions, an analysis of work roles, and interviews of personnel both in the corporate sponsors and in the mission/support elements. NSA OIG asks that you notify all personnel in your organization about this special study.

U//FOUO) The NSA OIG inspectors will be covering a broad range of NSA corporate functions, such as Legislative Affairs; Human Resources and Protocol; Information Technology; Finance; Acquisition; Policy; Education and Training; Security; Strategic Planning and Performance; Corporate Communications/Public Affairs; Installations and Logistics; Research; and Capability Requirements throughout NSA and as they fit into SID organizations.
(U//FOUO) After the initial briefing to SID Chief of Staff, the inspectors will be contacting various offices in SID. As you are contacted, please provide the information or documents as requested. If any special accesses will be needed to discuss mission or function in your organization, please make the inspectors aware upon contact with your office. Please provide the information required to obtain the correct accesses.

NOTE: If there are further actions are required by the OIG following this study, your organizations will be contacted directly by the SID IG Liaison through SID REGISTRY tasking. If you or your organization have questions regarding this Special Study, please contact the SID IG Liaison and/or SID IG Assistant Liaison .
