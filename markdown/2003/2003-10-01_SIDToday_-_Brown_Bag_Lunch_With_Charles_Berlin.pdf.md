(U//FOUO) Join the SID Chief of Staff, Mr. Charles Berlin, for a brown bag lunch on Tuesday, October 7th from 1130 to 1230 in Ops 1, room 2C087. The topic is leadership.
(U) Note: This session was originally scheduled for September 19th, but was postponed due to Hurricane Isabel.
(U//FOUO) As Mr. Berlin stated in his recent series on leadership : "I will be having a brown bag lunch to discuss leadership in a group setting. What to do when your leadership is bad? Where do I get a mentor? Who am I to judge anyone? Why is being a leader so hard at NSA? Can I lead from an Enlighten newsgroup? Are leadership and collaboration mutually exclusive? These and the meaning of life can all be discussed - see you then."
