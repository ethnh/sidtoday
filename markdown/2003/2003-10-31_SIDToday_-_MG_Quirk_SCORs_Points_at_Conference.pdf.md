(U//FOUO) MG Quirk opened the 3rd Annual Site Commanders Operational Review (SCOR) on 29 October 2003 by describing the unique opportunity afforded the site commanders to "put the 'U' in the U.S. SIGINT System." The General went on to say this year's SCOR has two purposes:

1. Determine how to make SIGINT as responsive as possible to the conditions in today's dangerous world; and
2. Determine how to coordinate SIGINT in a modern, 21st century way.

Put another way, "How do we move from running Dad's hardware store to being Chairman of the Board of Home Depot?"
(U//FOUO) The SID Director gave the site commanders a thumbnail of how SID got to where it is today, beginning with "Get it, Know It, Use It". He then introduced the newly expanded Issue Management Team (IMT) concept to the conference attendees, telling them this is how horizontal integration begins in SID.
(U//FOUO) The SCOR is a three-day conference being attended by more than 40 site commanders, operations chiefs, chiefs of staff and NCR's (National Cryptologic Representatives). The conference gives the site commanders - from across the world - an opportunity to come together and participate in the strategic planning for the enterprise, and to hear firsthand from the SIGINT Director where the enterprise is headed. The conference finishes up on 31 October.
