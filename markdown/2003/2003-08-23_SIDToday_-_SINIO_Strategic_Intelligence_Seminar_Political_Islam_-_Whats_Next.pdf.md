# Course Overview: 

(U) After the fall of Saddam, the start of the "roadmap" process in the Middle East, and the continued U.S.-led War on Terrorism, what is next for political Islam? Will U.S. actions moderate Muslim governments, or will radical elements force those countries to harden their stances?
