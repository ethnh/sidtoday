# (S//SI) An IMT is Coming to Your Mission!

(S//SI) Last November, in preparation for support to Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Signals Intelligence Directorate introduced the Issue Manager Team (IMT) construct. During Iraqi Freedom operations, the Iraqi IMT proved invaluable in reaching across the SIGINT Enterprise to work with customers, partners and operational entities to clarify and prioritize intelligence needs, identify gaps in the U.S. SIGINT System, and to strategize solutions to optimize the SIGINT system.
(S//SI) Capitalizing on the success of the IMT construct, we established four (4) additional IMTs since February, they are: Korea, Counterterrorism, Proliferation/Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and Latin America. To date, it is clear that through the great dedication and skill of these IMTs, we are gaining critical insights into ways to further optimize the SIGINT system. The men and women who serve as IMT members have been essential in this pursuit -- they are truly making a difference.
(U//FOUO) Recently we met with the DIRNSA and agreed to roll out the IMT construct on a global scale. For all IMTs the goals are the same - - to facilitate gap analysis and the integration of SIGINT activities across the SIGINT Enterprise and with customers, partners and stakeholders for their issue; simply put -- to optimize our performance in each of these target areas. All targets and issues do not require the same level of intensity and/or urgency at the same time. Acknowledging this and being committed to using our resources responsibly, SID will be implementing a tiered approach to IMTs.
(S//SI) The tiered approach takes into account that not all issues require three (3) full-time issue managers like the IRAQ and CT teams. Some IMTs, after an initial 3-month stand-up period, will have their members revert to part-time status and only go into full-time mode in response to some preset schedule or in the event of a crisis. The part-time members keep their regular positions in SID, working full-time on IMT duties only as needed. The three tiers are defined as follows:

Tier 1 - "High Alert" Team - three full-time positions

- Iraq
- Counterterrorism

Tier 2 - "Significant Alert" Teams - one full-time and two part-time positions

- Proliferation
- Asia/Pacific
- Information Operations

Tier 3 "Moderate Alert" Teams - three part-time positions

- Europe/Russia
- Africa
- MENA/Stans/India/Pakistan
- Latin America \& Caribbean
- Weapons \& Space
- Counternarcotics/Interanational Crime
- Counterintelligence
- Global Geopolitical Issues (Ecconomic/Social/Environmental)
(U//FOUO) While the SIGINT Leadership Team is currently working to define the IMT members,
in the future we plan to post IMT vacancies for competitive selection. As an IMT member you will work closely with me and the rest of the SIGINT Leadership team to strengthen our response to SIGINT challenges and inform our investment decision-making process. I encourage all GS-15s, DISES and DISLs with operational SIGINT experience to consider becoming an IMT member in the future. I am excited about our future and the steps we are taking with the IMTs. Our work should also substantially contribute to implementing DIRNSA's Transformation 2.0 objectives. I ask that you join me in working to implement this tiered approach and continue to improve our response to customers' information needs.
