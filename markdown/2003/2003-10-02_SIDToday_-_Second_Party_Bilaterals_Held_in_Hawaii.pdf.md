(S//SI) Earlier this month, SID Director MG Quirk participated in NSA- DSD and NSA-GCSB bilateral meetings in Hawaii. (The Defence Signals Directorate is Australia's SIGINT organization, and the Government Communications Security Bureau is New Zealand's.) Both sessions focused on the way ahead, with SID seniors briefing on topics such as the 5-Eyes SIGINT partnership business vision, information sharing, SIGINT Development, ELINT modernization, and the SID Layered Zone model. There was also discussion on Information Needs and how we can better share these requirements and our capabilities to report on these topics.
(S//SI) NSA and its partners discussed specific targets of interest, such as the Global War on Terrorism, proliferation, North Korea, and ways to maximize our collection strategies. NSA also briefed lessons learned in our support to military operations and joint tactical cryptologic support to coalition operations. We also held a trilateral meeting where the focus was overcoming challenges and looking for opportunities for collaboration, especially on regional counterterrorism.
