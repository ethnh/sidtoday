(U//FOUO) The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center
FROM:
Deputy Director for Data Acquisition
Run Date: 07/15/2003
(TS//SI) The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) serves as the "front door" for Data Acquisition and works closely with Customer Relationships, Analysis and Production, and the Extended Enterprise to ensure that a comprehensive crossprogram collection perspective is taken as NSA works to meet its customers' needs. The CSRC was originally formed as part of the creation of SID in February 2001, but really came to fruition post 9-11-2001. At that time the Deputy Director for Data Acquisition surged dozens of people to the CSRC with the goal of having the organization be the focal point for the orchestration of Data Acquisition activities in response to the crisis. With the military action in Iraq the CSRC has performed this "crisis" function again as the Functional Lead for Collection Issues and operator of the Data Acquisition Iraq Watch.
(TS//SI) The CSRC has three primary functions - daily orchestration of the access, collection and exploitation system; development of overarching data acquisition strategies in accordance with the SID Operating Principles; and management, monitoring, and troubleshooting of SID data flows.
(TS//SI) The Current Operations Division within the CSRC evaluates daily collection requirements and, based on the target communications being used and their vulnerabilities, assigns them to appropriate collectors for action. They also work closely with the Second Parties to ensure that we are effectively partnering on a broad range of issues, to include the TICKETWINDOW sensitive source sharing agreement. Additionally, this division provides direct 24/7 connectivity between NSA and a critical Third Party partner, targeting and compliance support to ensure effective selector management, and supports the Senior Collection Officer (SCO) desk in NSOC.
(TS//SI) The CSRC is a strong proponent of the SID Operating Principles, using them as the methodology for the development of strategies in the Strategy Development Division. In partnership with subject matter experts from Analysis \& Production and Customer Relationships, the CSRC shapes and assembles SID-level comprehensive strategies on high-priority targets or issues. In this construct, Customer Relationships analyzes the customers' information needs and provides both Analysis \& Production and Data Acquisition a thorough assessment of these needs. Analysis \& Production develops the analytic attack and the social networks of a target of interest. The SIGINT Development organization provides an assessment of the physical and logical networks associated with the targets social networks. From this the CSRC can determine where communications might be vulnerable, the appropriate sensors for collection, any gaps and shortfalls, and collection and exploitation capabilities that need to be developed and deployed.

(TS//SI) In December 2001 ITIS and SID jointly conducted a study to determine the most effective manner, organizationally, to manage and monitor SIGINT data flow. At that time the Data Flow organization was moved from ITIS to SID to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the SIGINT data flow management process and to couple it more closely with related functions. This "tweaking," following the February 2001 reorganization, has been very successful, enabling the CSRC to have the end-to-end mission management picture from collection requirement to delivery of data to an analyst/linguist for use. Management of data flow has allowed the CSRC to develop effectiveness and efficiency measures that will influence how mission management is done in the future.
(TS//SI) The CSRC served as the focal point for Data Acquisition for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The CSRC ran a 24/7 shop manned by personnel throughout Data Acquisition. The CSRC also had individuals deployed to GRSOC, CENTCOM, and in-theater at Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) in Kuwait. Additionally, the CSRC has been the operational lead for the development of CMM's Focused Demonstration for Iraq. The Focused Demonstration is a key step in the development of CMM, providing the CSRC, and ultimately other organizations, with the ability to understand NSA's collection posture against a particular target in a matter of minutes rather than the hours or even days it can take now. The CSRC will continue to partner with CMM to develop follow on projects that will present data in such a way that will improve the timeliness of mission management decision making.
