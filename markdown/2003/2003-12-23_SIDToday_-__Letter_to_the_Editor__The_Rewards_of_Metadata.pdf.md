(U//FOUO) We received the following comments on the recent article " The Rewards of Metadata ":
(U//FOUO) The article on metadata was good. Metadata is one of the keys to both Mission and Corporate Success. Many individuals do yet not recognize that metadata has been identified and defined within the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture Technical Infrastructure (one of seven domains). Just as metadata is a critical success factor to SID, it is also an important component of our business transformation. Like most things in life, powerful but complicated topics take some time to be institutionalized across the corporation and across the community.
