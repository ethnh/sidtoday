(U//FOUO) In recent months, SID has experienced a significant turnover in leadership. This was not limited to the appointment of MG Quirk and Charlie Meals as SID Director and Deputy Director-new leadership also has taken the helm of the SID Deputy Directorates ( see related article HERE ). In the coming days, SID Today will introduce you to the leaders-- both managers and technical directors-- of the Deputy Directorates for Customer Relationships, Analysis and Production, and Data Acquisition.
(U//FOUO) The leaders will share their thoughts on how they view their roles in SID, how they like to operate, and what results they would like to help SID and NSA achieve. We think this series of articles will give you a better sense of where SID is headed and how we intend to get there-- stay tuned!
