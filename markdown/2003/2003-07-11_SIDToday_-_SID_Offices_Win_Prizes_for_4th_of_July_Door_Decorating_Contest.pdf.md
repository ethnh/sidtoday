(U) Recently, two SID offices were awarded first prize for the 4th of July Door Decoration Contest (click HERE for a listing of the winners). The photos (view "Full Article" to see) show two of these doors: "Proof That Our Flag Was Still There" and "Star Spangled Agency". Here is the background on one of these:

# Proof That Our Flag Was Still There... And Always Will Be! Rm: 1C166

(U) The theme "Proof That Our Flag Was Still There" came easily to us. Everywhere you look, the proof is there. You see it on clothes, outside houses, on cars, in gardens, in businesses, in magazines, on TV, in movies, and for the last week, you can see the proof on the door to our office: the SID Senior Enlisted Advisor's office. Our office takes care of the 4000-billeted military members who work in SID. Our office is one of the first offices new military members come to when they arrive at the NSA. From there, we track our military when they are deployed, moving offices, and when they retire or leave here to go to a new duty station. It may be 30 years in the military or four, but seeing them fulfill a career like that is proof enough that our flag is still there.
(U) Developing the theme was easy. We had been collecting pictures and articles since the September 11th tragedy. We became an office the week of the tragedy. We were four offices that had never worked together merging into one that week. Like many Americans, the tragedy brought us all closer together. When we heard about the Independence Day door contest, we knew we had to do a door. We gathered all of the old photographs we had been collecting and began finding new pictures of other events that affected our great country. We also had to remember our fallen who had died serving and defending it. For weeks, we searched for anything that we thought was a good representation of why our flag is still there. We also know that our country isn't here just because of the military; even though we defend our country with our lives, we know that civilians play a major part as well. At the Agency we see this daily, even if America doesn't. We wanted people old and young and of every race represented on our door; just like our office and just like America.
(U) Patriotism should come easy. It's pride in what you believe in as well as love. We love our country and what it represents. Our office is proud we see what our military does to defend it-when we get a bright 19-year-old, ready to serve, checking into our office to start work, or a 47-year-old ready to retire. We are confident our flag will always be there.
