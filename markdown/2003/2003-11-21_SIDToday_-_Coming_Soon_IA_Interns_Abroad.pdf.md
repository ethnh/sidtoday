(U//FOUO) Coming Soon: IA Interns Abroad
FROM: SIGINT Communications
Unknown
Run Date: 11/21/2003
(U//FOUO) In the coming days, we will bring you a series of articles written by Intelligence Analysis (IA) interns who have done tours abroad (mainly in the Middle East) as part of their training program. They will discuss how they supported the military during wartime conditions, and also make some observations about the exotic places they have seen.
(U//FOUO) By way of background, here is some information (courtesy of the IA Skill Community) describing what the IA Intern Program is all about:

- (U//FOUO) The IA Intern/Cross-Training/MINSAP** Program, which has grown to over 200 participants, is designed to give analysts the IA skills and knowledge they need to fill our most critical SIGINT and Information Assurance mission gaps. It is expected that this program will develop well-trained junior analysts who possess both depth and breadth in a certain area of mission expertise and who, upon completion of the program, can "hit the ground running."
- (U//FOUO) The developmental program lasts three years, and includes both rotational assignments and formal training. The participants usually have six rotational assigments which generally last 6 months, but can range from 3 to 9 months depending on the complexity of the subject area or goals of the particular tour. The rotational assigments include on-the-job training in the areas of research, reporting, and SIGINT Development at NSA HQ. Other possibilities include an external assigment with a downtown customer, a NIST assigment or a tour at F6. At the completion of the program, the participant will be placed in a final assignment selected to match their experience/educational background with mission needs.
