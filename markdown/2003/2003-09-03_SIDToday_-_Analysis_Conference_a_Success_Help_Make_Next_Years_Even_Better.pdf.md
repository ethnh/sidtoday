(U//FOUO) Analysis Conference a Success; Help Make Next Year's Even Better!

FROM: Dan Aldridge
Chief, Applied Analytic Solutions Division
Run Date: 09/03/2003
(U//FOUO) Thank you for attending the first annual Analysis Conference, held last week, 25-28 August. Intelligence analysis is not done by rote. Our tradecraft is, necessarily, dynamic and comprehensive. It is incumbent upon an analyst to keep up with new techniques, to be aware of best practices, and to develop best practices by sharing their own valuable experiences with others in the community. The Analysis Conference is meant to provide these opportunities.
(U//FOUO) This year's conference featured more than 80 presentations. Keynote speakers included (in order of appearance):

- Dr. Mark Lowenthal, A/DCI for Analysis \& Production;
- Dr. John Poindexter, Director Information Awareness Office;
- Lt Gen Michael Hayden, Director NSA;
- Lt Gen (Ret.) James Clapper, Director NIMA;
- MG Richard Quirk, SID Director;
- Ms. Maureen Baginski, FBI Exec Director for Intelligence;
- A/DDAP;
- Dr. William Noite, Deputy A/DCI for Analysis \& Production; and,
- Mr. Jim Allen, DDAP.

Major points that emerged from the talks included: active analysis, building a strong analytic community, and raising the quality vice the quantity of our reporting.
(U//FOUO) More than 700 people participated in the conference, including a number of representatives from CSE, GCHQ, DSD, GCSB, CIA, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and our field sites. We ask that those who attended this year's conference help us to make NEXT year's conference even better by filling out a feedback form, which is also available via "go analysis conference".
(U//FOUO) Speaking of next year's conference, we are already making plans, with a target date of late spring or early summer. Please plan to attend, perhaps present a topic, or recommend a guest speaker. The web page for next year's conference will probably be posted sometime next March.
(U//FOUO) Thank you for making this year's conference such a success. We look forward to your participation in next year's conference, too.
