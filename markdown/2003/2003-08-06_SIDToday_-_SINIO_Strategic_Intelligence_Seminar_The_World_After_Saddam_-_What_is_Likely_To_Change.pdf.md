(U//FOUO) SINIO Strategic Intelligence Seminar: The World After Saddam - What is Likely To Change

FROM:
Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues
Run Date: 08/06/2003
(C) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present the eighth in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for Summer 2003. "The World After Saddam What is Likely To Change" will be presented on 12 August from 1200-1400 in Room 9A135 (HQS Bldg) . Advance registration is required; instructions are provided at the end of this article.

# Course Overview: 

(S//SI) In the first few days of the new SID Leadership Team, the SIGINT Director charged the SINIO Council with producing an assessment on how the most critical intelligence issues facing the nation are likely to change in a post-Saddam world, looking out through 2004. Taking the basic assumption that the United States, its partners, and their adversaries are operating in a modern global environment, and that activities or organizations in one region may have roots that reach far beyond that region, the SINIOs have reexamined the most critical intelligence issues facing the community and grouped them into three categories:

- Global Threats including Terrorism and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD);
- World Order issues includes five issues-"Axis of Evil", Regional Stability in the Middle East, "Coalition of the Unwilling," Role and Significance of Multilateral Organizations, and Global Economy;
- the Changing Battlefield including Military Thinking, Information Operations (IO), and Denial \& Deception (D\&D;).

For each issue the Council has provided an assessment of the consequences for SIGINT in terms of our need to surge, revise, or maintain our efforts against the major targets that comprise that issue. A team of SINIOs will present the Council's analysis of these changes, for the use of the NSA workforce.
