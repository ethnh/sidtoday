(S) The Partnership Dissemination Cell - Information Sharing With Third Party SIGINT Partners (repost)

FROM:
Partnership Dissemination Cell
Run Date: 12/01/2003
(S//SI) The global war on terrorism, U.S. involvement in Iraq, the advent of a new proliferation security initiative-- all these high priority topics include a concentrated effort to share tailored SIGINT information, derived from SIGINT product, with many of our valued Third Party SIGINT partners.
(S//SI) Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) called for the Intelligence Community (IC) to be more forthright in sharing product and technical data, which led to DIRNSA's desire to expand SIGINT information sharing with foreign SIGINT partners. The strategic goal behind the DCI and DIRNSA intent to share more information with valued partners is not only to foster SIGINT relationships but to also assist other U.S. intelligence programs and realize broader U.S. national policy objectives. The Customer Relationships Directorate's Office of Customer Response established the Partnership Dissemination Cell (PDC) to turn this intent into a reality.
(TS//SI) The PDC is part of the SIGINT Products Services Branch, within Customer Response's Products \& Services Division. The PDC processes information-sharing requests generated by NSA representatives such as Senior Liaison Officers (SLOs), Country Desk Officers (CDOs), and National Cryptologic Representatives (NCRs). Most requests are for permission to share information from E-GRAM end-product reports-- up to the TOP SECRET COMINT 5-EYES classification level-- with specific Third Party Partners. Current requests pertain to the global war on terrorism, Iraq, and proliferation/arms control. The bulk of the sharing is done with our European partners, along with Turkey (terrorism), Japan (terrorism), South Korea (Iraq), and Jordan (Iraq).
(S//SI) PDC analysts also work within prescribed guidelines authorized by the Directorate for Analysis \& Production product lines to select, review, modify, and/or sanitize specified SIGINT reporting to determine applicability and suitability for release to selected foreign SIGINT partners. These authorized guidelines are in place as a means to streamline the sharing process and often allow the PDC to review and release information without the need for product line coordination.
