(U//FOUO) What happens if a SID employee must relocate away from the capital region for nonprofessional reasons, but wants to continue to work? Many of the skills resident among the workforce do not exactly grow on trees, and it is of critical importance that SID find a way to retain those skills. Where there's a will, there may be a way: last week, MG Quirk signed a new SID policy on secure telecommuting.
(U//FOUO) A few key points:

- The policy applies to SID civilian full-time and part-time employees.
- The telecommuting must be conducted from a suitable remote secure government facility where local management is amenable to hosting the telecommuter. (It is a violation of DoD policy to allow telecommuting from a residence.)
- Approval for telecommuting is given on a case-by-case basis, and at the discretion of SID management - it is not an employee entitlement.
- Supervisors are responsible for determining which positions are appropriate for secure telecommuting and what skill sets are required for these positions.
(U//FOUO) This innovative policy gives SID new flexibility to keep employees with critical skills our must important asset - working to produce SIGINT. For further information, see the secure telecommuting policy document posted on the SIGINT Policy homepage.
