(U//FOUO) The Collection Association (CA) honors two recipients every year with its prestigious Ardisana and Mooney Awards. CA members have had their hands full with high-priority operational commitments the last couple of years, and as a result, some of the CA awards are behind schedule. and their committee members are doing great work in trying to get at least the Ardisana and Mooney back on schedule. Recently the winners of the 2001 Mooney and 2001 Ardisana awards were announced, and a call for nominations for the 2002 awards was recently released. (Click HERE for the Mooney and HERE for the Ardisana.) The selection for the 2002 Ardisana and Mooney awards will occur in the fall-- entries are due to the Chairs by 8 August 2003.
(U//FOUO) Mr. Tom Mooney was a Senior Executive at NSA who was admired by his peers and those who worked for him throughout his 35-year career in the field of collection. His dedication and leadership were responsible for significant contributions and improvements in collection productivity through advances in automation. The Mooney Award recognizes the "Collection Manager of the Year".
(U//FOUO) BGEN Ardisana was a 25-year cryptologic professional who pioneered many collection practices that are used today. Additionally, he was a charter member of the Collection Association Council and played a vital role in the establishment of the Collection Association. At the time of his death in 1978, BGEN Ardisana was serving as the Assistant Deputy Director of Operations (ADDO) for the National Security Agency. The Ardisana Award is given to the individual intercept operator who is judged to be the "Collector of the Year."

The Mooney Award and Ardisana Award plaques are displayed in NSA's Operations Building 2B, and each year the winners' names are permanently placed on the plaques to signify their accomplishments.
