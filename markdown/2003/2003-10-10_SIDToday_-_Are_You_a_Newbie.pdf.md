(U//FOUO) As a follow-up to our recent "Are You a Grizzled Veteran" and "Grizzled Veteran Part II" articles, here is another in our Friday "human interest story" series. Today's topic is: You are definitely a newbie if you cannot remember:

- when the elevation of the parking lot snowpile reached mountain status.
- the cat claws were first installed.
- you could get a card punched for coffee purchases that would get you a free coffee every 6th cup.
- "testing" the red/green/blue evacuation routes.
- training en masse to use your QuickMask 2000.
- there was no SID today .
