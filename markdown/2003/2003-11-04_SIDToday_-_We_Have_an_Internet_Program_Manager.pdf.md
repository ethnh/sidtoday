(U//FOUO) We Have an Internet Program Manager!
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA Signals Intelligence Director Run Date: 11/04/2003
(U//FOUO) Many of you are aware of the tremendous, positive impact access to the Internet has had on our ability to do our jobs. The success stories keep rolling in! Because of these successes, we have accelerated the introduction of Internet connectivity in the last year, increasing the number of connected terminals by almost 500 percent! ...and we are still at it.
(U//FOUO) Optimizing this valuable resource requires that we establish policies for its use and provide guidance and assistance in using the Internet as a research resource. To marshal these efforts, I have approved the creation of the position of Internet Program Manager (IPM) and have named Mr. Charlie Speight as the first SID IPM.
(U//FOUO) The IPM operates within the Office of Integrated Planning (S01) under the Chief Technology Officer, and is the focal point for issues related to the Internet and SID.
(U//FOUO) This includes:

- serving as POC for SID Internet-related policies; workforce advocate;
- consultant to SID management/leadership;
- strategic planning; liaison with ITIS;
- monitoring SID Internet-designated funds;
- recommending Internet-related training;
- maintaining metrics on SID Internet use;
- collaborating with SID Skill Communities, the Intelligence Community and 2nd/3rd Parties and;
- assisting the Extended Enterprise in accessing the Internet.
(U//FOUO) Charlie will continue working with Information Technology Infrastructure Services (ITIS) and Eagle Alliance to create a new Agency-wide unclassified network for Internet access that consolidates the old BRAZEN and OSIS (COSMOS) systems into a single system called OUTPARKS.
(U//FOUO) You can find more about OUTPARKS as well as information on Internet use, accesses, and policies on the IPM website.
