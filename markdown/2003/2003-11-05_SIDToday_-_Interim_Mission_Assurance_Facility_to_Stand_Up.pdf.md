(S//REL) Interim Mission Assurance Facility to Stand Up
FROM: CES Systems Engineering Office (S3106)
Run Date: 11/05/2003
(TS//REL) The tragic events of September 11, 2001 brought into focus a terrible vulnerability faced by the National Security Agency. That is, NSA's ability to protect the nation through SIGINT is at severe risk due to the single point of failure represented by the Fort Meade campus. Should NSA lose this campus, the nation would go deaf. Making the problem more difficult is that NSA's assets at Fort Meade represent multi-billons of dollars invested over multidecades. In response to this challenge, the Mission Assurance (MA) project was initiated. The SID MA team is made up of elements from CES, other SID organizations, ITIS, Eagle, LF/Corps of Engineers, Security, CIO, Acquisition and Finance, and others.
(S//REL) The SID MA vision has been to protect the nation by protecting the mission, and to do it sooner than anyone could think possible. The strategy involved creating an Intellectual Capital Recovery (ICR) mechanism to store the "blueprints" to the SIGINT factory, as well as creating a 24x7 "load-sharing" factory all off of the Fort Meade campus. has been designated as the interim MA facility. The goal is to distribute as much capability as possible in a robust fashion, although at a substantially reduced capacity.
(S//SI//REL) Due to financial limitations, has to be implemented in phases roughly equivalent to one year:

- Phase 1 in FY03 obtained, prepared, and secured $\square$ and created the ICR capability. Mission population concentrated on the CES mission.
- Phase 2 will focus on adding in Analysis \& Production and reporting databases and servers, and CARILLON .
- Phase 3 will add the National Time Sensitive System, Trailblazer, and emergency relocation watch centers for four $24 \times 7$ cells.
- Phase 4 will add in non-COMINT missions, a cryptanalytic expansion, and Special Access Programs.
- Phase A, running in parallel with Phase 2, will serve to protect the IAD mission.
(TS//SI//REL) $\square$ Phase 1 is now in "limited operational testing". Complete mission stand-up and IOC will occur over the next few months. Because $\square$ exists due to acts of terrorists on 9-11, terrorist-related communications were deliberately chosen to be the first bits sent to $\square$ On September 29 of this year, within one fiscal year of initiation, $\square$ successfully processed its first bits against a terrorist-related target.
(TS//REL) a subsequent permanent MA facility or facilities, and the entire MA program have a long way to go. Work to date is necessary but not sufficient. However, the tremendous progress made over the last year has already provided NSA a capability unique in its 50-year history. And, it has come in on time and within the MA budget. The $\square$ success is a great example of what cross-organizational teaming and a passion for the mission can accomplish.
(S//REL) You can help! The SID MA ICR back-up and restoration teams want to hear from you. If you have critical softcopy Intellectual Capital (e.g. source code trees, scripts, target knowledge databases, etc.) we want to ensure that your systems have been identified and, shortly, added to the list of items to be backed-up at $\square$. Please feel free to contact us for further information. We don't want anything to fall between the cracks.
(U//FOUO) POC: $\square$ can be reached at $\square$ (grey) or $\square$ nsa.
