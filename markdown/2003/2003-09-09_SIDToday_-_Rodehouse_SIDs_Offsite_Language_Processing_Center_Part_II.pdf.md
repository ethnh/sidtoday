(U//FOUO) Rodehouse: SID's Offsite Language Processing Center (Part II)

(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: This is the conclusion of a two-part article. Click HERE to see part one.
(U) Post 9/11 Surge
(S//SI) Following 9/11, the need for more linguists with native or near-native ability in lowdensity languages was critical and once again, we turned to the off-site facility concept. The first post 9/11 mission that was established was for Somali. In order to establish it quickly, and because one of the most talented linguists could be cleared only to SECRET, the mission was set up at the SECRET level. Since this involved taking SIGINT out of SCI channels, the Director had to approve the mission. An Urdu mission at the S//SI level quickly followed.
(S//SI) "Rodehouse" - as the project was now called - was short on space at Airport Square, just as more language missions were urgently needed to support Counterterrorism efforts. In response, NSA leased and outfitted the third floor of $\square$, and the project moved into the new facility in February 2003. With room to expand, four more missions were added: Arabic, Amheric, Pasto/Dari and Tagalog. All of these missions are at the S//SI level, and we plan to establish additional SECRET missions only by exception.

# (U) Clearance Issues 

(S//SI) Although the S//SI missions do not require the Director's approval, each is documented by an SPF (Staff Processing Form) signed by the SID Deputy for Communication and Support Operations, to ensure that it is in accordance with SID policy. The specific requirements and operations of each mission are also documented in a CONOP (Concept of Operations), which is reviewed by the target offices, the Directorate for Data Acquisition and the contractor. The linguists are supervised by fully-cleared contractors who also provide liaison with the target offices. Because the facility has personnel at three clearance levels (SECRET, S//SI and TS//SI), they are physically segregated and have different levels of computer access. Working with the ITIS organization and DK (the Chief Information Officer), a multi-level systems security architecture was developed for Rodehouse. In addition, the linguists were given the first operational deployment of the latest suite of transcription tools, named Nucleon.

## (U) Future Opportunities

(U) Rodehouse offers many opportunities for employing government and contractor personnel who are not fully cleared. A pilot Russian OJT (On-the Job Training) program for first term military linguists who do not yet have their full clearance is underway and, if successful, could be a model other language OJT programs. There is also the possibility of bringing government personnel who do not yet have their full clearance into the facility.
(U) The RSOC's and Second Party Partners have both expressed interested in establishing Rodehouse-type facilities, and we are working with them on the many complex security, systems and personnel issues that must be addressed for this approach to be successful.
(U) In an environment that requires a flexible, rapid response to changing world events, Rodehouse provides another language resource to target offices.
