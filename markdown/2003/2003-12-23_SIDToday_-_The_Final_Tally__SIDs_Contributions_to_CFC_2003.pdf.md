(U) We recently ended one of the most successful Combined Federal Campaigns in this Agency's history. NSA's 2003 campaign raised the single largest amount for the Central Maryland campaign, contributing a total of $\$ 1,593,610.20$. SID employees gave $\$ 690,950.56$-- that's $\$ 100,000$ more than in 2002!
(U) As the SID Senior Keyworker for the 2003 Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), I'd like to express my thanks again to everyone who supported this year's campaign -- those who participated in CFC events, those who made donations, and keyworkers, canvassers and coordinators throughout the entire SIGINT Directorate that made it all happen. Many, many causes will benefit from your generosity, and your gift will make a positive difference. Thank you.
