(U//FOUO) Data flow in, data flow out - somehow it reaches my desk. How does it get to my desk every day? Is there really a data fairy - the urban legend of the data flow career field? YES!!! What data flow managers do is ofttimes perceived as magic by creating order out of chaos and untangling the mysteries and complexities of delivering SIGINT to the customers. There are many data flow managers in SID. We reside in many areas, but CSRC (the Collection Strategies and Requirements Center) has the bulk of this critical career field. Our job entails so many aspects, its hard to mention them all, but these data flow managers perform miracles and feats of magic every day.
(C) The SID data flow manager (DFM) is someone who is well versed in many areas and is customer-oriented to ensure that the customer/analyst has collected, processed and selected data available for analysis and reporting, whatever kind of analysis is required, regardless of data type. When do you contact a DFM? What role does the DFM play in SIGINT delivery? The DFM is involved daily with:

- Ensuring that targeted/selected intercept is delivered to you, 24/7;
- Monitoring data flows to direct intercept appropriately;
- Establishing and testing new data paths, formats and processing capabilities;
- Discovering and resolving data corruption problems;
- Interfacing with Second and Third Party Partners to receive data for NSA analysts;
- Briefing end-to-end data flow capabilities/threads to various customers, internal and external;
- Troubleshooting reasons for data loss and/or data surge; and,
- Ensuring that legal requirements are satisfied regarding the processing and storage of traffic.
(U//FOUO) The daily jobs are diverse, as are the people in these positions, throughout the SID. Backgrounds of DFM's vary from computers, to cryptanalysis, collection, analysis, and telecommunications. Many skills are required to be successful after all, not only does a DFM understand data, they comprehend all the processing that is required to ensure that the collected signal is successfully converted to data and intelligence. The DFM is involved in all aspects of data flow - assisting in the development aspects, current flow management and even archive retrievals. And of course documenting all actions for posterity as well as Mission Assurance!
(C) However, the most important job a SID Data Flow Manager has is interacting with our customers. We are here to ensure current mission data coming into our processors, flows in a timely manner without corruption. We are here to establish new or enhanced data

flows within NSAW, Extended Enterprise, and Second or Third party assets. We are here to be part of the resolution to problems as well as prevent problems with new capabilities and deployments that may or may not have been coordinated with us and our downstream customers. We are everywhere.
(U//FOUO) Being a data flow manager is a hard, yet rewarding job. We are helping to ensure that processed SIGINT is available now and in the future. New technologies are daily challenges that are being tackled successfully by the SID data flow managers. We make a difference, not only for the current architecture, but also for near-term and future SIGINT architectures.
