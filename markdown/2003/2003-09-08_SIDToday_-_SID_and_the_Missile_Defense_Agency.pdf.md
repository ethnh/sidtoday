(S//SI) If we had only one word to sum up NSA's relationship with the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) today, it might be "synergy." Tasked by presidential directive in 1984 to develop a Ballistic Missile Defense System that can intercept enemy missiles in all phases of their flight, the MDA (formerly the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization) initially focused on system-related research, development, testing and evaluating activities. In recent months, however, MDA's mission has expanded significantly.
(S//SI) In addition to conducting RDT\&E; activities, MDA analysts are now studying threat-based issues - adversarial intentions and capabilities - with an eye to incorporating pertinent and useful intelligence into the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), and ultimately increasing the system's ability to defeat enemy missile attacks before they can be brought to bear against the U.S., its allies, or friends. Towards this end, MDA has expanded its operations to include an Intelligence Directorate that is eager to receive SIGINT that responds to MDA's new information needs. In response, various components of the Signals Intelligence Directorate have joined forces to improve and refine SIGINT delivery to this key customer.
(S//SI) With MDA's new focus on threat-based issues in mind, the NSA/CSS Representative for Defense (NCR DEF) and Customer Account Management quickly went to work to identify existing INs that would be of interest to MDA's analysts. Once these INs were identified, SIGINT Product Services added MDA to the relevant distributions, allowing MDA's analysts to receive SIGINT product directly from NSA for the first time. (Previously, product was routed through NCR DEF). Another key player, Senior Executive Account Manager , worked closely with A\&P;'s leadership to ensure that S2 production lines were sensitive to MDA's information needs and best prepared to service those needs. Now that MDA is fully engaged in the National SIGINT Requirements Process, the SIGINT National Intelligence Officers for Strategic Programs and Arms Control and DEFSMAC personnel are meeting regularly with MDA to establish a framework for further refining missile defense intelligence requirements.
(C) MDA has called the relationship they have with NSA the most progressive and responsive of all the intelligence organizations and are using this relationship as the model for working on requirements and interactions with the other intelligence agencies. Anything we can do to identify opportunities that will further support MDA's mission, enhance collaboration, and increase information sharing will only make this relationship stronger.
