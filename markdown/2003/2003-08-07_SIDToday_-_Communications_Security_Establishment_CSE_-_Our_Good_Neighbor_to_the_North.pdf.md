(U) Communications Security Establishment (CSE) - Our Good Neighbor to the North

FROM: $\square$ CDO Canada and Toni Moffa, CANSLO
Run Date: 08/07/2003
(U//FOUO) Did you know that about 450 Canadians visit NSA yearly to do business and advance our common objectives?
(U//FOUO) NSA and CSE share a rich history that dates back to World War II. Throughout much of its history, CSE has contributed to the safety and prosperity of the United States and Canada through its ability to master the strategic Cold War threat. Today, CSE is focused on mastering the global information infrastructure.
(U//FOUO) In December 2001, Canada passed Anti-Terrorism legislation that confirmed CSE's existing mandate and added new authorities. This legislation, together with increased resources, as well as some unique accesses arising from Canada's geographical and technical niches, put CSE in a great position to make a difference to the SIGINT community. (See CSE's SIGINT homepage HERE).
(S//SI) CSE's technical and financial contributions to the development of SIGINT solutions, as well as bilateral projects such as CATAPULT help advance key objectives and promote the overarching SIGINT agenda. CSE is especially focused on working with NSA to tackle our common North American Security priorities, including terrorism, proliferation and cyber threat . In fact, CSE plans to dedicate 40 percent of its SIGINT resources to security initiatives. CSE wants to master SIGINT Development, and make it the foundation of all its access and analysis programs.
(S//SI) Providing support to military operations is also a priority for CSE. Canada provides troops to coalition forces deployed abroad, e.g., Afghanistan, and CSE together with Canadian Forces Information Operations Group are responsible for the cryptologic services that accompany the troops.
