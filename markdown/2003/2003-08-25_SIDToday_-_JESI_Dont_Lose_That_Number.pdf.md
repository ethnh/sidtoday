(U//FOUO) JESI: Don't Lose That Number!
FROM:
Chief, SID/Knowledge Enablement
Run Date: 08/25/2003
(U//FOUO) Last month, I had the opportunity to represent SID at the annual Joint Executive for SIGINT Interoperability (JESIpronounced "jessy") Conference, held in Canberra, Australia. What is JESI, and why should you care? First, the definition: JESI is a "multi-national executive body responsible for ensuring continued interaction and interoperability among the five SIGINT partners." Notice that it is an "executive body" - this means that it does not have a dedicated staff. There are leads for various efforts, but essentially JESI is you and I! Now to the second part: why should you care? ...Because JESI is trying to make it easier for all of the Second Parties to collaborate on producing SIGINT, and to exchange information in general.
(U//FOUO) Although NSA has had bilateral relationships with individual Second Party countries going back to the 1940's and 1950's, we did not have any group (5-EYES) partnership until 1993. JESI was formed in 1998 to bring structure to our interactions and to provide a SIGINT operational focus to our dealings. Since then, it has developed a structure enabling us to systematically address different problems. $\qquad$ of ITIS and I (for SID) serve as the senior NSA representatives to JESI; several additional NSA representatives lead specific JESI functions.
(S//SI) So what has JESI accomplished? Our efforts have really been picking up steam, especially in the last year:

- InfoWorkSpace (IWS) was deployed as a collaboration tool that was used to exchange information among NSA, the U.S. military, and partner countries during Operation Enduring Freedom.
- MAINWAY, a system that uses phone call contact chaining to identify targets of interest, was provided to each of our partners. The partners now supply additional contact information to the database to enhance our joint ability to identify targets.
- JESI has pushed the agencies to deploy an interoperable public key security infrastructure (PKI), to enable the exchange of certificates among all partners. (Yes, you have JESI to thank for the switch from ICARUS to PKI...)
- NSA has been cooperating with CSE on a prototype of a system to deliver SIGINT on Demand to customers. NSA is forwarding SIGINT data to the CSE SLINGSHOT system, which delivers end product to their customers. CSE has established CATAPULT., into which they deliver 5-EYES end product.
- Several protected web sites have been established to allow Second Party partners to share data securely within their community of interest.
..not bad!
(C) The meeting in Canberra in July focused on our mission objectives and how they relate to the recently published 5-EYES SIGINT Partnership Business Vision . We addressed: 1) mission collaboration and knowledge sharing; 2) enabling SIGINT operations through information assurance; 3) exchange of finished intelligence; and 4) maintaining business continuity.
(U//FOUO) I hope this gives you a sense of what JESI is all about. With your participation, JESI will continue to make it easier for us to collaborate with our Second Party partners to produce the best possible SIGINT. For further information, see the JESI homepage .
