(U//FOUO) Airborne SIGINT Engineering Integrated Product Team Part I

FROM: National Tactical Integration Office (S14)

(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: This is the first of a 2-part article.
(U//FOUO) Interoperability....Re-usability...Horizontal Fusion....TPPU (Task, Post, Process, and Use) .... Today's buzzwords are voiced within NSA, but even more so, out in the tactical SIGINT community. It is rare that these "in" words are NOT heard during any conference, briefing, meeting, etc in the tactical SIGINT community today. Are these words thrown around just to impress our stakeholders downtown and seek funding for a particular project, or are there really efforts within the tactical community trying to achieve the concepts behind these words and move toward a more collaborative, cohesive, tactical SIGINT enterprise?
(U//FOUO) The Airborne SIGINT Engineering Integrated Product Team (ASEIPT) is one effort within the tactical SIGINT community that demonstrates true movement towards a more collaborative, cohesive, tactical airborne SIGINT enterprise. In FY-02, the Defense and Intelligence Authorization Conference Report stated that "ASD(C3I) should develop an architectural plan to provide standards-based policy direction to the services, whose platform program offices can develop systems and, to the maximum extent possible, share developments." With two major tactical airborne SIGINT systems (Army's Arial Common Sensor - ACS and Air Force's Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload - ASIP) on the doorstep of development, Mr. John Stenbit, then ASD/C3I, responded to this report by establishing the ASEIPT.
(U//FOUO) The ASEIPT consists of platform system engineers representing all the major airborne tactical SIGINT platforms (ACS, Guardrail, EP-3, Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS), Multi-Mission Aircraft (MMA), GLOBAL HAWK/ASIP, Rivet Joint, and U-2) as well as NSA's Tactical Platform Division. NSA's National Tactical Integration Office (NTIO) is the facilitator of this IPT (Integrated Process Team). The ASEIPT provides the forum for the services to identify opportunities to collaboratively meet operational requirements while emphasizing cross-platform re-usability and interoperability. Mr. Stenbit wants to foster true collaboration between the services by using open systems architecture concepts in developing SIGINT solutions once and extending them out amongst other tactical systems to the maximum extent possible. Although it is not reasonable to expect a "one solution fits all" solution, sub-sets of hardware, software, implementation standards, etc. may be leveraged across multiple service SIGINT platforms.
(U//FOUO) The ASEIPT provided the avenue for the Army and Air Force to develop a joint open system architecture baseline and the establishment of their relationship was formalized between the two program offices. This collaboration has grown in importance with the Navy's decision to adopt the ACS as its next generation tactical SIGINT platform (EP-3 replacement). We will now have three Services working collaboratively to design next generation tactical airborne SIGINT systems.
