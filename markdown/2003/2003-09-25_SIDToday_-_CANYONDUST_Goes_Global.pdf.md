# (U//FOUO) CANYONDUST Goes Global

(S//SI) Sometimes a solution to a specific problem turns out to have wider applications than originally intended. Take, for example, CANYONDUST, a ground-based INMARSAT geolocation capability. It was originally intended to satisfy a significant analytic capabilities gap for the Western Hemisphere narcotics target. It has proved so useful, however, that three additional systems will be deployed this calendar year to cover the majority of landmass around the world.
(TS//SI) This effort will provide analysts with a 24/7 geolocation capability, will enhance/compliment current overhead capabilities, and will provide considerable data for target discovery efforts. Although it is not as accurate as Overhead (satellite-based) geolocation, CANYONDUST is far less expensive and, used wisely, can greatly reduce the burden on the limited Overhead resources. For example, CANYONDUST can carry out the preliminary legwork in finding high-interest targets, at which time Overhead resources can then be steered to give a more precise geolocation.
(TS//SI) The currently operational system at TIMBERLINE (the FORNSAT collection facility in Sugar Grove, West Virginia) has provided results that have helped SID and GCHQ analysts working the Counterterrorism, China and Korea, and narcotics targets. It performs about 250,000 terminal geolocations per day. While the system is being funded with primarily DCIP (The Defense Counterdrug Intelligence Program) money, it is being transferred to S3's FORNSAT Division for full integration into the SIGINT System's architecture and life cycle support issues.
