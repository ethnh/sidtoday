(U//FOUO) SIGINT in Nebraska
FROM:
NSA/CSS STRATCOM
Run Date: 08/14/2003
(U//FOUO) Regards from the Heartland of America...Offutt AFB, Nebraska! Here near Omaha, SIGINT has played an important role in supporting three generations of the Strategic Command: the Strategic Air Command from the early 1960s through 1992; the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) from 1992 to 2002; and the new USSTRATCOM-- created by merging with the former United States Space Command-- from 2002 to present. (See related story HERE ).
(S//SI) When the two commands merged in October 2002, SID and NSA/CSS STRATCOM quickly adapted to the expanded mission set of the new USSTRATCOM. SID now provides the command with intelligence on space control and surveillance operations, information operations, computer network operations, and space campaign planning, (See story HERE for further information.)
(S//SI) In tackling these new missions, STRATCOM plays a role in areas that once would have been considered unfamiliar terrain, such as the Global War on Terrorism. NSA/CSS representatives at STRATCOM worked with the 55th Wing and 755th Communications Squadron at Offutt AFB to turn one of their HF out-stations at Scribner, Nebraska into a radio frequency test range, which most recently was used during Operation ENDURING FREEDOM (the campaign in Afghanistan). Prior to OEF, the range was used to test non-conventional, airborne, and ground-based collection against cordless, cell, and satellite phones used by known terrorist groups. As a direct result of this test, airborne collectors sent to the Middle East were able to identify previously unidentified push-to-talk systems used by terrorists.
(TS//SI) Meanwhile, SID continues to play an important role in STRATCOM's more traditional missions, such as efforts to account for Strategic Relocatable Targets (SRT) in Russia, China, and other nations with developing assets. For example, SID supported USSTRATCOM during the latest "show of force" demonstrations by Russian Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF) units. SID/Strategic Rocket Forces provided timely SIGINT to USSTRATCOM imagery analysts, helping them confirm many SS-25 (Sickle) Road Mobile ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) deployments during the SRF's winter training cycle that ended in May 2003.
