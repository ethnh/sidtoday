(U//FOUO) For the past four days we're presented new analytic methodologies and techniques that are available to today's SIGINT analyst, and you're probably wondering, what can I do to stay abreast of these exciting new developments? What opportunities are available to maintain my analytic proficiency? What you should be aware of is the multitude of opportunities to grow and develop as a SIGINT analyst.
(U//FOUO) SIGINT analysis isn't getting any easier, our targets are becoming more sophisticated, they're taking advantage of advanced communications technologies and finding new ways to try to thwart us as SIGINT analysts. We must use these changes to our benefit and not allow the volume, variety and velocity of data flowing into NSA to be a liability. It is our job to maintain proficiencies in advanced telecommunications technologies and cultural awareness. We must continue to hone our basic analytic skills, such as generating and evaluating competing hypotheses, developing an awareness of analytic traps such as groupthink and bias, performing metadata analysis, and engaging in collaborative knowledge discovery. Target development skills such as Social Network Analysis and Target Templating are vital to finding new targets and maintaining continuity with the targets we already know about.
(U//FOUO) All analysts have opportunities to advance their skill and knowledge levels, whether in informal, on the job settings or in formal training programs. Within the operational setting, analysts can acquire knowledge and skills from debating, discussing and collaborating with experts on operational problems, taking advantage of mentoring programs, evaluating new techniques and associated tools, and engaging in the discussion at A\&P:
Showcases, Advanced Analytic Seminars and Annual Conferences . A\&P; also provides for more focused learning environments in which analysts are protected from the press of daily operations Joint SCAMPs (Summer Cryptanalysis Math Program), specified POD Research Programs sponsored by S3T, the AIRP (Analysis Innovation Research Program), and a new Advanced Analysis Lab program beginning in FY04 - SEAS (Summers for Excellence in Analysis Seminars). Informal learning is also supported 24/7 by accessing the SIGDEVToday Learning Portal and the Analytic Best Practices on WebWorld.
(U//FOUO) Since many of today's learning needs cut across organizational boundaries and traditional skill field communities, identifying gaps in skills and knowledge and matching them with the most appropriate sources of learning is the joint responsibility of each analyst, manager, technical director, and skill field community expert. Formal training, provided by both the expert analyst and by external training services, continues to evolve to address the more structured skill and knowledge learning needs of SID analysts and provides yet another venue for analysts to
