# (U) Chef's Choice: Third Parties

(C) Hello everyone! This is the first in a series of monthly articles in which I'll be speaking to you about what's happening in SID, from my perspective. I think this is a great opportunity for me to let you know what we're up to and where I see things headed. To kick things off, today I'd like to talk to you about an issue that has a major effect on our business: our Third Party connections. How can we make full use of the capabilities and resources they can offer us as SIGINT partners?
(S//SI) Our Third Party relationships are different from our Second Party ties in that we do not share information across the board with the nations involved - rather, we draw up tailored agreements to collaborate on particular missions and share only specified types of information and capabilities. This does not mean, however, that we can't have very productive dealings with them! In fact, I think we can go substantially further than we have so far in working with other countries to get the best SIGINT we can to our customers. As someone once said, "If you always do what you always did, you'll always get what you always got!" We need to look at things with new eyes and be more aggressive in taking advantage of these partnerships where it makes sense.
(S//SI) In some cases, Third Party associates can provide us with SIGINT collection or reporting that we simply could not, or should not, duplicate. If a Third Party believes they are in a good position to provide collection or a service that we are using our resources to cover, we shouldn't dismiss it. We should take the opportunity to check it out. If it is true, then take them up on it! Perhaps we could use our resources on something of a higher priority. Frankly, since 9/11, and with the war in Iraq, we just haven't had the time to give this question the attention it deserves. When Third Party officials meet with me, they know very well what's on their agenda. Believe me, it wouldn't be a good thing if I had absolutely no clue what we wanted to accomplish! So now, SID, IAD and FAD (Foreign Affairs Directorate) are working together (see SID today ) to establish the Strategic Direction of these relationships in a coordinated way, and to try to be creative with solutions.
(S//SI) For example? Well, if we can't deal with the civilian authorities in a certain country, can we establish a military-to-military agreement? Can we deal with countries that aren't necessarily our close allies when it's mutually advantageous to do so? Will prudent, but aggressive, sharing of SIGINT-derived information with a foreign SIGINT partner advance U.S. policy goals? Let's look into it!
(S//SI) As you go about your work, I ask you to give this matter some thought. If you have an idea on how we can better use our Third Party ties in your area of expertise, run it up the flagpole with your management. Talk to the right people in FAD, starting with the Foreign Affairs Officers FAD has deployed in your organization. Maybe it's a good idea, maybe it's not - but don't give up until you've determined which it is. Don't assume it's impossible - let's seize those opportunities!
