(U) The Shadow Knows

FROM:
Deputy SIGINT National Intelligence Officer for Warning Run Date: 11/05/2003
(U//FOUO) The old adage goes that you can't judge another until you've walked a mile in his shoes. I recently had the chance to walk a mile (at least!) and spend 12 hours with SID Director MG Richard Quirk under the "Shadow the SIGINT Director" program . This program represents a rejuvenation of Ms. Baginski's original "Shadow-a-Senior" program, and provides the opportunity for SID's "average Joe's" to spend the day trying to keep up with one very dynamic General.
(U//FOUO) As a seasoned SIGINT-er and occasional cynic, my original interest in the shadowing program was based in a desire to get a view of Transformation initiatives from the top to balance the "trickle down" effect we so often get at the other end of the management chain. During the course of one very long day, I had the chance to gain an understanding of the types of issues routinely handled by SID's senior management, garner the salient points of initiatives underway to move us ahead in the Transformation process, and recognize the themes woven across many topics and meetings. These all represented issues important to General Quirk in regards to NSA's role as the Signals Intelligence authority.
(U//FOUO) Over the course of marathon meetings, one-on-ones, and phone calls, I experienced several revelations. One was the frequency with which the SID Director must act as a bridge between divergent views on SIGINT policy issues; MG Quirk was often a facilitator between our own SIGINT leaders and other elements both within and outside NSA. Another very pleasant revelation for me was the importance to which MG Quirk assigns the responsibility of the SID Director to address critical operational issues - specifically shortfalls - and to incorporate ultimate operational responsibility as part of the SID Director's leadership protocol.
(C) The breadth of topics to which I gained exposure ranged from new databasing systems and continual fostering of our foreign partner relationships to future visions of vital areas such as NSOC and the leadership of SID itself. One of the many common threads recognizable across the spectrum of meetings that constitute the SID Director's day is General Quirk's emphasis on unifying the efforts of tactical SIGINT units, NSA HQ, and the Extended Enterprise to form a cohesive and unified cryptologic architecture. You can't gain insight like this by relying on staff meeting notes. While I must confess to a certain trepidation before I participated in the Shadow the SID Director program, it is without any reservation that I recommend it to those interested in gaining an understanding of NSA's strategic SIGINT vision and, perhaps, to those who want affirmation of the need to "assume (the) noble intent" of those leading our SIGINT efforts.
