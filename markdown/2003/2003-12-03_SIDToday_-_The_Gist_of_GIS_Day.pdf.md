(U) The Gist of GIS Day

Geospatial Exploitation Office, Operations Division (S2L1)

(U//FOUO) NSA joined over 600 worldwide local \& federal agencies, schools and businesses in celebrating GIS Day on 19 November. The Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO), in coordination with the Geographic Resource Center, Advanced Analysis Laboratory, and Intelligence Analysis Skill Community, presented our GIS Day Event in the Friedman Auditorium. The theme of this event was "GIS (Geographic Information Systems): Enabling Analysis \& Empowering Customers". The purpose of NSA's GIS Day was to update the workforce on migration efforts from legacy mapping tools to commercial-off-the-shelf spatial analysis tools.
(U//FOUO) Mr. William B. Black, Jr, Deputy Director, NSA presented the keynote speech to over 250 NSA \& other IC communities attendees. Our guest speaker, Mr. John Young, Director, Enterprise Solutions of Environmental Systems Research Institute, spoke about "GIS as an Enterprise Application: Benefits and Challenges".
(S//SI) The day began with a video focusing on NSA's use of GIS tools. The video showed how NSA has taken tremendous amounts of near-real-time SIGINT, analyzed it geospatially, and provided that information directly to the warfighter. The video, produced by the NSA Television Center, showed how the use of GIS helps us provide our customers with actionable intelligence.
(S//SI) With presentations including an overview of commercial tools, NSA Extensions, applied analysis demos and geospatial data, NSA's GIS Day showed how GIS technology has become an integral part of the SIGINT Analyst's toolbox. Of particular significance is the fact that GIS has enabled the first multi-agency reporting in NSA history, as SIGINT and imagery are fused to create joint NSA / NGA (formerly NIMA) reports.
(U) Presentations are available at the GIS Day topics website (or "go gis day").
