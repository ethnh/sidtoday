(U) Operations Security (OPSEC) in SID
FROM: SID OPSEC Manager
Run Date: 12/18/2003
(U) "OPSEC is concerned with identifying, controlling and protecting generally unclassified information that is associated with sensitive operations and activities."
(U) What better way for those of us at home to support the war on terrorism than by learning more about OPSEC and how to protect our critical information?
(U//FOUO) By now, everyone should have heard about DIRNSA's requirement for mandatory OPSEC training (course OPSE1301/1300). Some have even mastered the system troubles and have actually completed this training...but what does OPSEC really mean to SID employees?

- How can you apply it in your day-to-day activities?
- Where can you go if they have OPSEC questions or concerns?
- Who can you talk to to get more information, more training, or become more involved?
- Is there more specific SID applicable training on OPSEC?
(U//FOUO) We'll answer these questions and more in upcoming OPSEC program updates in SID today. There are resources within your own organization and within SID to help you recognize how OPSEC applies to your position, and to let you know what everyone can do to better protect their daily activities and missions. Stay tuned for further information.
(U//FOUO) In the meantime, if you have any questions related to OPSEC issues, please contact your SID OPSEC Program Managers, and $\square$ on $\square$
