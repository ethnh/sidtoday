(U//FOUO) Now that we are closing the 2003 P3 cycle, we are entering the next milestone in the performance management process - the promotion cycle. This note is to remind you to begin updating your Internal Staffing Resume (ISR) and assembling your Performance Review Package (PRP). Your PRP should contain your resume, your P3, and your employee profile once it is available. For guidance and examples of how to complete your ISR and PRP see the guidance, examples, and templates webpage .
(U//FOUO) Additional articles will be forthcoming detailing the promotion process and timeline, to include when and where to hand in your PRP, as well as how and when to pull your employee profile. Also bookmark the following web site for performance management topics and tips: the Workforce Performance Management Executive webpage .
