(U//FOUO) SIGINT Requirements' Analysis Center of Excellence (ACE)

FROM: Kevan Barton

(U//FOUO) SID spends millions of dollars each year to procure, develop, test, and deploy capabilities. However, we often end up asking ourselves, "Did we actually get the capability we expected?" Our stakeholders are also asking the same question.
(U//FOUO) To ensure that we do, in fact, get what we pay for, NSA is following the acquisition and capabilities development processes outlined in DoD5000 and CJCSI 3170 (Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System). The ACE is charged with facilitating and/or performing the independent and objective analyses mandated by these processes, helping SID make sure it:

- Fully understands its capability gaps
- Sufficiently explores the solution space to identify suitable solutions that can bridge those gaps
- Can select the most suitable solution from among many possibilities; and
- Has the analytic documentation to defend expenditures to stakeholders.
(U//FOUO) The ACE had its genesis in the CMM Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The CMM AoA provided data to help decide which CMM solution the agency would pay for. This AoA was the first fully documented and reported AoA the agency had done under the 3170 rules. SID leadership didn't want the expertise to escape after the AoA was completed. So, the team moved from CMM to SIGINT Requirements and their portfolio of responsibilities expanded to assisting other SID programs, offices and efforts with this type of analysis. As an example, ACE representatives have been heavily involved in the Site Prioritization Integrated Product Team (IPT), helping SID leadership make strategic decisions about where to deploy future capabilities for the SIGINT system.
(U//FOUO) Other SID jobs with which the ACE is currently involved include: conducting a conceptual level analysis of CMM's Government Reference Architecture (GRA); reviewing the investment strategy of the FIS community; and providing expertise to the Space Borne Planning Division, which is participating in the ongoing NRO-led AoA of potential overhead solutions. Additionally, the ACE brings to SID the best decision analysis methods for conceptual level architectural evaluations through its close fraternal relationships with the military services, other community members, and academia.
(U) The ACE briefed its methodologies at the community Military Operations Research Symposium (MORS) in June, and continues to mature the community understanding of conceptual architecture evaluations. Next on the horizon for the ACE is to host a communitywide conference in February 2004. The purpose of the conference is to capture the current state of conceptual architecture evaluations in the community and academia.
(U) This may all sound unconnected to the mission, but in reality, our job in the ACE is to support the analysis required to get the capabilities SID needs to do the mission.
