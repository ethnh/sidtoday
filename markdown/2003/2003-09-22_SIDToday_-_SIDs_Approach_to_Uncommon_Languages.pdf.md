(C) Are you in need of a Fuzhou-English Dictionary? How about a Haitian Creole-English Dictionary? Have you always wanted to investigate what it would take to learn the Kazakh language? This is just a small sampling of the myriad language working aids that Project Schoolbag makes available to NSA linguists. Project Schoolbag has its origins all the way back to 1964. Managed by the Senior Language Authority (SLA) Office, it is the SIGINT Directorate's primary source for applied linguistic research. To date, over 100 books (dictionaries, glossaries, grammars and textbooks) on over 60 languages have been published as a result of this research.
(C) The SLA also sponsors the Strategic Strongholds in Less Commonly Taught Languages (LCTLs) Program. This program replaces the Current Operational Language Reserve (COLR) and the Contingent Language Acquisition and Maintenance Subprogram (CLAMS). LCTL emphasizes proficiency at Level 3 and higher; previous programs targeted Level 2.
(C) Another difference between Strategic Strongholds and previous programs is that Strategic Stronghold member language analysts are offered up to four weeks of training and/or work experiences per year, instead of two weeks in the old program. The program aims for training 35 language analysts per Stronghold - an improvement over the 1-2 analysts we had in many languages in the past.
