(U//FOUO) SIGINT Directors to Collaborate Virtually

FROM:
Collaboration Project Manager
Run Date: 09/10/2003
(U//FOUO) The Five-Eyes SIGINT Directors will soon be using a new tool to enhance their collaboration on subjects ranging from current intelligence objectives to future collection planning. The tool, InfoWorkSpace (IWS), is a virtual collaborative network accepted by DOD and the Intelligence Community as the standard collaboration tool suite of choice. IWS will enable the directors to communicate from their desktops using VTC, text chat, audio conferencing, whiteboards, and shared view.

## (U//FOUO) IWS Already in Use Among Five-Party Workforces

(S//SI) NSA'ers and their Second Party counterparts at the working levels are collaborating hourly via IWS on a number of key topics including: Operation Enduring Freedom, international terrorism, real-time collection coordination, SIGINT Development, and multi-intelligence tasking. Five Party community managers and analysts are taking advantage of this capability to save time, establish stronger ties, and provide maximum support to customers worldwide. Because of the successful use of IWS by these members of the SIGINT community, the Joint Executive for SIGINT Interoperability (JESI) has agreed that IWS should be deployed to the Five-Eyes SIGINT leadership.

## (U) SIGINT Directors To Gain Access

(U//FOUO) The SIGINT directors will be given access to one of the IWS servers managed by NSA, the VOTEDOOR server. They will have all of the IWS collaborative tools available to them on their desktops to conduct business at the strategic level, just as over four thousand members of their respective workforces have used it for operational purposes. Ultimately, the personal interaction among the directors that is so vital to our national interests and those of our partners will be increased; strategic oversight of operational issues will be facilitated; matters that require consensus may be resolved expeditiously; and challenges can be discussed in a collegial setting.

## (U//FOUO) How To Get an IWS Account for Yourself

(U//FOUO) You may not be a senior decision maker and your reason for choosing virtual collaboration may not directly respond to a crisis, but your collaboration efforts are vital to strengthening the SIGINT partnership. If you want to save time and resources no matter what your objectives are, IWS can be the answer. The cost of participating in IWS collaboration is minimal (a little time and effort), while the potential benefits are limitless. Interested personnel can access the Collaboration Station web page for information on training and accounts.
