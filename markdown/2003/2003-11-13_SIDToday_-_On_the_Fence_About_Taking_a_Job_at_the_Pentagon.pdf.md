(U//FOUO) There will be a Brown Bag Lunch on 14 November in Room 2B4118-3 at 11001200 hours for anyone interested in learning more about Pentagon operations and NSA's critical intelligence support to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs. Come meet Mr. Chief of CSG Joint Staff, and see how the NSA personnel at the Pentagon are the key component of the intelligence support to Admiral Jacoby.
(U//FOUO) The CSG is part of the National Military Joint Intelligence Center (NMJIC) Alert Center and directly supports the Director of Intelligence (J-2), Joint Staff, and is the focal point for providing all-source, strategic intelligence to senior Pentagon officials, the Joint Staff, Military Departments and the Unified Commands. The hub of this activity is the NMJIC Alert Center, a 24-hour/7-day watch operation which includes representation from CIA, DIA, NSA and the uniformed services. The Cryptologic Services Group Joint Staff (CSG Joint Staff) maintains a SIGINT watch which provides round-the-clock time-sensitive SIGINT support.
(U//FOUO) will describe "the day in the life of the CSG Joint Staff," great examples of intelligence support and potential opportunities to work in the CSG. This session will be of interest to analysts, collectors, interns and customer relations personnel. Come join us in this informative session.
