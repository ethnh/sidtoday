(U) Getting an Expert Opinion

FROM:
Deputy Branch Chief, PRC Defense Industries

(S//SI) When NSA analysts work with highly technical subject matter, the insights and specialized knowledge of a subject matter expert are invaluable in helping explain what's really going on. What's more, the best time to apply that expertise from across the Intelligence Community (IC) is before the SIGINT report is published. What's the best way to make this happen?
(S//SI) The Chinese Defense Industries Branch (S2B33), in its role as the Target Operational Pilot (TOP), has been working on just such a project: the E-document Sharing Program. This pilot will allow S2B33 analysts to share Evaluated Minimized Traffic (EMT) - i.e. SIGINT that has potential intelligence value, stripped of any references to its origin or other sensitive information - with a limited set of IC subject matter experts.
(S//SI) This collaboration mechanism will not replace established NSA reporting formats: information in the documents cannot be further disseminated or referenced until officially published by NSA. The EMT documents will be shared via a virtual meeting and document storage locale using the Information Workspace (IWS) collaboration tool. There will be an IWS virtual room established on the Intelligence Community Collaborative Presence (ICCP) server, accessible through PKI certification, where S2B33 analysts will post EMT for review and discussion.
(C//SI) This E-document Sharing Program differs from an existing TOP effort called the PartTime Integree Program., in which IC analysts work in NSA's physical spaces for short periods on a scheduled basis. While this existing program (it began over a year ago) has amply demonstrated the benefits of increased formal collaboration, its approach is not always the best option, especially when the subject matter experts have to travel long distances.
(U//FOUO) Both of these programs - the Part-Time Integree Program and the E-document Sharing Program - represent exciting advances in information sharing and movement toward Transformation 2.0. They reflect the ingenuity of the work force and a tangible advance in providing better SIGINT for our customers.
