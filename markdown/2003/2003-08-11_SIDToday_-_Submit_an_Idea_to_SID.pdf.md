# (U//FOUO) Submit an Idea to SID 

FROM:
SIGINT Communications
Run Date: 08/11/2003
(U//FOUO) Heads Up! Get your thinking caps on! After a brief delay, the SID Ideas Program is back in full force! And we want to hear your ideas!
(U//FOUO) Here's how the new SID Ideas Program will work. There have been changes, so reading the following information will help you get your idea approved and implemented .
(U//FOUO) Anyone throughout the SID workforce can submit an idea, and you can submit as many ideas as you want. Not all ideas will be accepted however, so make sure that you thoughtfully construct your idea, making sure that it is a reasonable and feasible idea for implementation. The Ideas Program Manager will gather all of the incoming ideas for a onemonth period. At the end of that period, all ideas will be read, reviewed, and considered for implementation. Each month a selection of ideas will be presented to top-level SID Leadership and one idea will be selected from the bunch for implementation.
(U//FOUO) There is a little bit of competition now in order for the idea to go from light bulb to light fixture, so to speak. We are very excited about the new SID Ideas Program, so start brainstorming--the first ten ideas submitted will receive a special prize!
