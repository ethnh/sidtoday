(S//SI) In August, MG Quirk announced that SID was "reopening the front" on Iraq. With the continuing threat of attacks against coalition forces a major area of concern for the campaign, SID has formed a dedicated group to concentrate on developing leads on this problem: September 15th marked the stand-up of the Iraq Terrorism Development Center, or ITDC. The ITDC is located in the Meade Operations Center (MOC) and has the mission to perform target discovery and development against known or potential terrorist and former regime targets in Iraq.
(S//SI) Using all available sources of information, the center works to generate SIGINT leads and follows them continuously until they prove unviable or until the targets are eliminated. It also serves as the gatekeeper for field elements seeking analytic development work from NSA on possible force protection-related targets, and responds to requests from customers for analysis against specific targets or areas.
(S//SI) The ITDC is under the direction of NSA's SIGINT Development Strategy \& Governance (SSG), in partnership with the Office of Counterterrorism (CT), Office of Middle East North Africa (MENA), Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO), the Meade Operations Center (MOC), and the Army Technical Control and Analysis Element (ATCAE). It is manned by over 40 analysts from these organizations, and draws on expertise throughout the NSA Extended Enterprise. Analytic exchanges are conducted via the DL IQTERRDEV alias.
(C//SI) The ITDC's target development effort maintains core hours of 1130-2100z (i.e. 07301700 local time) Monday - Friday. A watch component is also available 24/7 to accept requests for information. For further information on the ITDC, contact on www.iotcd.org
