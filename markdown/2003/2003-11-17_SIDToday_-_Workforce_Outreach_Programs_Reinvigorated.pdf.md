(U) After a short hiatus during which the new SID leadership team got used to navigating the sometimes choppy waters of SID, the Workforce Outreach Programs of Shadow the SID Leadership, Walkabouts and What's On Your Mind sessions are back in full swing.
(U) These are opportunities that just shouldn't be missed! MG Quirk, Mr. Meals and Mr. Berlin are putting aside time on their incredibly busy calendars to make sure they get to know you, understand what you are doing and learn what is important to you (and vice versa).
(U) Shadowing either MG Quirk, Mr. Meals or Mr. Berlin involves spending a day doing everything the leader does: going to meetings, greeting visitors or whatever any given day has to offer.
(U) What's On Your Mind involves your workgroup or team and your management. One of the SID leaders will meet with your workgroup in a designated conference room or other appropriate place where the group will be free from interruptions and spend some time, generally 90 minutes, learning what your organization does and the things being done that everyone is proudest of.
(U) A Walkabout gives the SID leadership the opportunity to see you, your management and your coworkers in your natural environment, so to speak, no special setting, no equipment demonstrations. It is kind of like shootin' the breeze with your workmates except it's the leadership.
(U) Don't delay, sign up today!
