(U) The outstanding accomplishments of NSA's Center for Applied Machine Translation (CAMT) were recognized recently when its founder, Dr. David Savignac of Analysis and Production Technical Services (S212), received the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement, the Intelligence Community's second-highest award. The accompanying citation identified the CAMT as a "center of excellence" and noted that "no other concentration of machine translation expertise can match what is in the Center's office". It also pointed out that "the Center is receiving more and more attention as agencies, unified commands, and laboratories search for ways of dealing with large volumes of data".
(U//FOUO) Dr. Dave established the Center for Applied Machine Translation ("go camt") in the late 90's to provide machine translation to the National Security Agency and to share NSA translation technology with the Intelligence Community, the Department of Defense, the FBI, and with Second and Third Party allies. It now provides translation into English from more than 60 foreign languages, of a quality at least adequate for scanning and filtering (triage). Its premier product, CYBERTRANS, has provided over a third of a million translations since it was put on line.
(U//FOUO) Asked to identify the key factors in his successful careers (he's had more than one) here at NSA, Dr. Savignac responded, "Three things. First of all, for what I did I had to have depth, I had to have continuity. Flitting from job to job wouldn't have cut it. Secondly -- in both instances I inverted the usual NSA management structure. I took the technical lead, did technical work, and delegated management responsibilities to real smart people junior to me in grade. It worked out very, very well. Third -- accessability. My door is always open -- literally. If I create the right atmosphere, folks just might feel comfortable enough to walk in and tell me that they think I am going to make a mistake. That's one of the best things that can happen." As for his future plans, he says, "I could have retired a couple years ago, but I'm still having fun. I like the people I work with and I like having so many challenges at the Center. I like the support I get from up above. So I guess I'll be hanging around for while longer. Besides, there's some work I want to do with Kyrgyz ...".
