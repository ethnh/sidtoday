(U) At a first-ever two-day strategic planning session held earlier this year, the SIGINT Directors of NSA, GCHQ (United Kingdom), CSE (Canada), DSD (Australia), and GCSB (New Zealand) agreed to a 5-Eyes** SIGINT Partnership Business Vision, a statement of principles for the 5-Eyes SIGINT Enterprise, and strategic goals and performance measures designed to position the Partnership to better address the threats of today's world and to meet the challenges of tomorrow.
(U//FOUO) The principles and goals (see HERE ) span all the functional areas of the Enterprise and envision a working relationship beyond interoperability - a truly interactive, cooperative SIGINT system which better serves the need of all while still respecting individual national needs and sovereignty.
(S) The SIGINT Directors presented the results of their work to the Directors of the five Agencies in the margins of the recent PALLISER Heads of Service Conference in Canada. The Agency Directors accepted the Business Vision in principle, and the SIGINT Directors took away actions to pursue implementation of the business vision, working through the Joint Executive for SIGINT Interoperability (JESI). (Note: watch for a coming SIDtoday article about JESI.)
(U//FOUO) **The term "5-Eyes" is shorthand for the U.S. and its four Second Party partners. It derives from the "US/UK/CAN/AUS/NZ EYES ONLY" caveat that limits the distribution of SIGINT reports to the listed Second Party countries.
