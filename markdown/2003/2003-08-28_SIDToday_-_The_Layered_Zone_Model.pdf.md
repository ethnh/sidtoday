# (U//FOUO) The Layered Zone Model 

FROM: SIGINT Communications
Unknown
Run Date: 08/28/2003
(S//SI) Four months ago, the Program Managers for the TRAILBLAZER Objective Program asked the Technical Directors of Customer Relationships, Data Acquisition, and Analysis \& Production to provide their ideas on the direction the program should take. Over a period of four months, guided by outside experts from the Technology Review Panel, a larger group of technical directors from SID, RAD, and IAD put together a model of the critical functions they believed the TRAILBLAZER Objective Program must provide.
(S//SI) The model, known as the Layered Zone Model (LZM), however, goes beyond the scope of the Objective Program and is an end-to-end model SID will use to drive architecture, planning, and programming. MG Quirk has approved its implementation in SID, and the Director is sharing this message with IC (Intelligence Community) partners and the SCEs (Service Cryptologic Elements). Next month, the LZM will be briefed to Second Party Partners at the DSD and GCSB Bilateral Conferences in Hawaii.
(U/FOUO) A narrative on the LZM and Power Point pictures are now available on the SIGINT Directorate web site (CLICK HERE). Comments can be addressed to: Jack Israel, Dave Hurry, and Greg Wessel.
