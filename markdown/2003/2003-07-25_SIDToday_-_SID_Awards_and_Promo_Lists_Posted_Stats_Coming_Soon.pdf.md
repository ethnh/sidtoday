(U//FOUO) SID Awards and Promo Lists Posted; Stats Coming Soon
FROM:
Workforce Management Executive
Run Date: 07/25/2003
(U//FOUO) Now that the FY03 promotion cycle is over, we would like to catch you up on a few things. As you know, this year's process was broader than promotions-- it also included a range of rewards for excellence performance, including QSIs (Quality Step Increases), SSWPs (Sustained Superior Work Performance), SAAs (Individual Cash Awards) and SABs (Team Cash Awards). In reality, it would be better to now call the process a "pay adjustment" process that will lead us eventually to compensation reform.
(U//FOUO) This year, for the first time, we posted both the SID FY03 Promotion List** and SID Awards List : we thought it important for everyone to see the results of the entire new pay adjustment process. (**Just in case you did not read the fine print at the top, note that the Promotion List gives the names by grade before promotion.)
(U//FOUO) The Workforce Performance Management Executive webpage soon will provide some initial promotion statistics-- promotions by grade, by skill community, and by organization (high level). Later, we will break the organization chart down further and chart promotions by work roles. Our statistics will include a look at the entire "pay adjustment" process by presenting promotions, QSIs, SSWPs, SAAs, etc. in some manner, to show the big picture. We also hope to compile figures showing the P3 scores in comparison with the type of compensation individuals received. Finally, we will analyze all of the above statistics to isolate the results of those who turned in PRPs (rather than the entire population). If you have any good ideas on some useful statistics, please let us know and we will see what we can do.
