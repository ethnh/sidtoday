(U//FOUO) On 6 and 7 October, CSE hosted NSA SIGINT Seniors at the 2003 CSE/NSA SIGINT Bilateral, held at the Fairmont Chateau Laurier Hotel in downtown Ottawa. Since NSA and CSE share responsibility for helping defend North America, the theme of the discussions centered around ways to enhance cooperation, collaboration and understanding of the needs of our respective nations.

This initiative will test our ability to collaborate in several areas, including Information Needs, metadata, target templating (using the Analytic Knowledge Base), access, and the development of social networks.
- Southeast Asia Counterterrorism and IWS - Implement a 5-Eyes commitment to have SE Asia CT analysts up and running on shared information workspace.
- Support to Military Ops - Canada, which is preparing to have significant military presence in Afghanistan, will host an Afghan "rock drill" ; CSE/CFIOG to attend an upcoming Iraq "rock drill" to prepare.
