(U//FOUO) This 5-day series, "When Meeting Customer Needs Mearns Defending the Nation", has described the Customer Relationships Directorate's (CRD) new Information Needs process as well as its new customers and new dissemination vehicles. These new activities are the result of building on the success of 50 years of SIGINT products and services. Today, our vision is providing the right information to the right customer at the right time--within their information space--completely focused on our customers' successful outcomes.
(U//FOUO) Toward that end, we are embracing processes and technology that will make available the intended outcomes of customer Information Needs, customer feedback, observed customer behavior and preferences, outright customer complaints and their resolution across the SIGINT enterprise at the touch of a button. We have been developing the business processes for this technology for the past 18 months and are now ready to prototype the technology that will lead us to trending and analysis of customer feedback and behavior. We expect this to result in improved one-to-one customer relationships that benefit many customers across the board.
(U//FOUO) In order to manage complex customers who have multiple demands, CRD has built a structure to underpin the Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM) /Account Manager (AM) program. That structure is the Customer Service Steering Group (CSSG). Its charter is to ensure that customer issues are not dropped before resolution and that resolution for one customer translates into resolution for all customers with similar issues. The CSSG is co-chaired by the Deputy Director for Customer Relationships and the SEAM Program Manager.
(U//FOUO) The CSSG conducts mini-customer assessments every month based on issues that have "bubbled up" from Account Managers, NSA Representatives, SIGINT National Intelligence Officers (SINIOs) and others who meet to review accounts. The CSSG is composed of the Signals Intelligence Directorate's primary "movers and shakers" who can personally intervene to resolve policy and resource issues. The results of the CSSG are reported monthly to the SID Executive Leadership Board. The Director's staff has also expressed interest in the results of this effort, particularly since the CSSG sessions include National Cryptologic Representatives (NCRs).
(U//FOUO) The core of NSA's customer relationships is understanding and meeting our customers' Information Needs. Through hard work and partnering with elements of the Extended Enterprise, the Signals Intelligence Directorate has enjoyed some success with its customer interactions, but there remains much work to be done to further this advance. We will rise to the challenge to change with our customers, anticipate their needs, and
