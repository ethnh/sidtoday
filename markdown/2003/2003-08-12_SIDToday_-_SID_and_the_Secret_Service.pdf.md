(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: This article is related to today's NSA Daily feature on NSA-Secret Service interaction. Here, we highlight the SIGINT support angle:
(U) Protective Mission Support
(S//SI) NSA/SID is closely involved with the US Secret Service (USSS) -- especially with regard to their protective mission -- and has been for quite some time. SID, through the Special Collection Service/Special Operations Division (SCS/SOD), provides Executive Protection close support operations when the President, Vice President, or occasionally other selected governmental officials travel abroad. If the executive is traveling to an area where there is a permanent SCS site, that site is tasked to provide Executive Protection close support. If no permanent SCS site exists, SOD deploys a 3- or 4-person team to the location to be visited by the VIP, usually several days in advance, and conducts 24 -hour live coverage while the protectee is in-country.
(U) Additional SID Support
(S//SI) Other SIGINT support to the Secret Service:

- SID provides significant intelligence in support of USSS's counterfeit investigative mission, particularly in the area of the North Korean Supernote (i.e. counterfeit highquality $\$ 50$ and $\$ 100$ bills produced in NK).
- SID's Crime and Narcotics Product Line has recently reviewed areas of joint interest concerning collection of Colombian criminal-related activity with the U.S. Secret Service's Criminal Investigative Division (CID).
- SID's Office of Target Reconnaissance and Survey recently briefed CID on a development effort to geo-locate communications from cellular, pager, and computer targets. Discussions focused on potential testing and evaluation of the system and its potential uses.
(S//SI) Secret Service Provides Database Access to SID
(S//SI) For its part, the U.S. Secret Service provided NSA/SID access to the Financial Crimes Division (FCD) on-line database. Procedures and log-ins were provided to NSA managers in Follow the Money and Follow the People programs to access FCD databases with particular interest to Mastercard and Visa information. USSS also provided the software and data to load and search the credit card information on NSA's classified web. Once installed, this will give NSA analysts the ability to do real-time, on-line pulls and determine if a particular credit card was issued by a foreign bank.
