(U//FOUO) In 1971, a small group of energetic individuals founded the International Affairs Institute (IAI) with the intent of presenting to the NSA populace a variety of distinguished speakers from the fields of business, politics, the military, and academia. Their aim was to promote an interest in international events and affairs while providing unique insights into those issues. That mission continues today, as the IAI routinely hosts speakers from classified and unclassified arenas to lecture on hot topics in international affairs and encourages its members to write and publish papers on related subjects.
(U//FOUO) The IAI employs many methods of raising awareness of international affairs. These include annual events such as the International Challenge, which tests members and nonmembers on their international affairs trivia, a book sale featuring the latest and greatest in international affairs literature, and an essay contest covering a range of subjects. All of these endeavors are well received by employees and many also include cash prizes for the winners! This year's challenge is scheduled for September 17.

(U//FOUO) The organization is also extremely well connected to the IA (Intelligence Analysis) Intern program. An intern sits on the IAI Board, and the organization has recently instituted a new policy granting membership to all IA Intern new-hires, free of charge for their first year. This recruitment tool has been very successful, and has prompted IAI to reach out to the other skill-field communities with a similar membership agreement offer.
(U//FOUO) The International Affairs Institute has been reaching out to the workforce for over 30 years, hosting hundreds of speakers and lectures and publishing numerous papers on international issues. We welcome new members as we look forward to the next 30 years! For more information on this organization, visit the International Affairs Institute webpage ("go IAI").
