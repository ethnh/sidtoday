(U//FOUO) Message from MG Quirk on Foreign Affairs Strategic Directions

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director
Run Date: 07/31/2003
(U//FOUO) Dan Wolf, , and I have agreed to pursue a new process to ensure we are leveraging our foreign partners to maximum advantage to help accomplish the NSA/CSS SIGINT and IA missions. This new process, which we have designated "Strategic Directions," responds to the Director's charge to develop a corporate Foreign Affairs program that is agile and responsive in supporting the NSA/CSS cryptologic missions.
(U//FOUO) The Strategic Directions initiative uses a "Global Team" (SID, IAD, and FAD) approach to examining SID and IAD needs against a constantly updated set of data on the capabilities of individual partners or groups of partners. The Global Team will bring to the table enough insight and perspective to identify appropriate opportunities, coordinate and deconflict activities across foreign relationships, and then assign to each partner the right role. The same team will consider the needs of our partners, their and our national political objectives, and integrate them into the process.
(U//FOUO) When the process is completed, we should find ourselves in a "best fit"situation with each partner, and be able to identify future areas for expanded cooperation with our partners. This process will also lead to more effective planning and budgeting of resources. An added advantage is that it will position us effectively to address the growing demand for performance measures by OMB, Congress, and the White House.
(U//FOUO) We have identified an ambitious schedule for this process, leading to results within six months. FAD will take the lead in implementing the Strategic Directions initiative over the next several weeks, and we request your full cooperation on this very important initiative as it becomes integral to the way we in SID, FAD, and IAD conduct our foreign affairs business.
