Have you been tasked with responding to Questions for the Record or Requests for Information from Congress? SID LA will assist you in analyzing the request, providing background and context to the responsible action office, and reviewing the responses to ensure that they meet the five Cs (candid, complete, correct, consistent and corporate) for dealing with Congress.
