(C) As you are aware, Raw Traffic can be shared only with those who are within the SIGINT Production Chain. But, what do these terms mean, exactly?
(C) Recognizing the need for a consistent definition of these terms, the SIGINT Directorate this year released SID Directive Number 406 : SIGINT Production and Raw Traffic Access. This clarifies: "What is Raw Traffic?" and "Who are the SIGINT Production Elements... and who are not?"
