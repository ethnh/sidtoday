FROM:
Deputy SINIO for Global and Multilateral Issues
Run Dates: 11/20/2003 , 11/21/2003 , 11/22/2003
(S) The SINIO Council Presents:

- The Honorable Kim R. Holmes, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of International Organization Affairs, State Department
- Topic: US-UN Relations and UN Reform
- Friedman Auditorium on Tuesday, 25 November, 1200-1230
(S//SI) Afghanistan, Syria, Liberia, Kosovo, Ethiopia, Bosnia, East Timor, Burma, Colombia....what do all of these countries have in common? A UN presence! The United Nations touches every region of the world and UN representatives, missions, and organizations are involved in the resolution of most of the major intra- and interstate conflicts across the globe. It is in the United Nations that 191 member countries come together and work to resolve such critical global issues as HIV/AIDS, non-proliferation, hunger, and organized crime and narcotics.
(S//SI) The shift from a bi-polar, Euro-centric world to a single superpower amid a sea of national and regional entities vying for increased global prominence, in an era of increasing transnational threats, offers serious challenges for the post-World War II construct that is the United Nations. As the issue of UN reform becomes increasingly important to US policymakers, State Department's Bureau of International Organization Affairs is charged with taking the lead in US efforts on this issue. Please join The Honorable Kim R. Holmes, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of International Organization Affairs, State Department, in Friedman Auditorium on Tuesday, 25 November, 1200-1230, as he addresses the NSA workforce on the future of the UN, the state of US-UN relations, and how SIGINT supports him in his work with USUN and Ambassador Negroponte.
