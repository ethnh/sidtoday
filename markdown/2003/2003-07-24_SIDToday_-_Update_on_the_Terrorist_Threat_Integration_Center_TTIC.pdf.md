(U//FOUO) Update on the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC)
FROM:
NSA Representative, TTIC
Run Date: 07/24/2003
(C) It is almost 3 months since TTIC's inception and we don't know where the time has gone. On 1 May, TTIC stood up and was staffed with approximately 50 TTIC officers. Today, another 50 workstations are available for additional TTIC personnel in the adjoining space. TTIC is staffed with officers from CIA, FBI, DHS (Dept. of Homeland Security), DIA, State, NSA, DOE (Dept. of Energy), Capitol Police, NIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency), and the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission).
(U) A couple of developments of interest to SID:
(C) The TTIC Director, as the successor to the ADCI (Assistant Director of Central Intelligence) for Homeland Security, became the DCI's responsible official for Information Sharing. The other officials responsible for information sharing are Maureen Baginski, the FBI's Executive Assistant Director of Intelligence, and General Frank Libutti, the Department of Homeland Security's Under Secretary for Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate. These three officials have agreed to establish a Program Office within TTIC to ensure implementation of an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) on Information Sharing. The TTIC's Information Sharing Program Office will be responsible for determining the universe of terrorist-related information that is available within all of the TTIC's component organizations and ensure compliance with the letter and spirit of the Information Sharing MOU.
(C) The DCI has asked the former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, Dick Kerr, to head an independent and objective group called the Kerr Commission that will assess the current allocation of responsibilities and make recommendations to the DCI about TTIC's appropriate mission. This is related to the analysis and production of finished intelligence on international terrorism. This review is necessary to shape appropriately the ultimate mission of TTIC and to determine what analytic resources, personnel, and mission responsibilities currently dispersed throughout the Intelligence Community should be migrated to TTIC.
(U) TTIC held a kick-off event on 9 July at the construction site of the new Hazel-Peterson (HP) building in McLean. Initial TTIC occupancy is still on schedule for May 2004. TTIC is still in the development stage, but much progress has already been made-- watch for future updates!
