# (U) A Daily Adventure!

(S) Welcome to the CSG Joint Staff, the Pentagon! This is truly the place for people who want to be involved in providing support to the warfighters and the decision makers. The CSG Joint Staff is located in the National Military Joint Intelligence Center (NMJIC), in the heart of the Pentagon. On 11 September 2001, when the rest of the Pentagon was evacuated, the NMJIC personnel remained in place and continued working while another group from the CSG Joint Staff deployed to a "secret, undisclosed location."
(U//FOUO) There is no shortage of surprises to be found in the Pentagon. Simply walking through the hallways can be an adventure, seeing Chinese military officers, tourist groups, and television news reporters. I once came upon Gen. Myers and Mr. Tenet talking in the hallway with no minions or entourages in sight.
(S//SI) There are some unusual benefits for working in the Pentagon. Whenever we have to brief someone, the "someone" is usually a general or admiral with decisionmaking authority and responsibility. SIGINT is a most highly valued commodity here, and it quite often provides the bulk of the information presented daily to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The CSG watchstanders have an outstanding relationship with the other desks in the NMJIC and are relied upon for a variety of intelligence expertise. The CSG plays a key role in the Pentagon's "continuity of operations" plan.
(U//FOUO) An assignment to CSG Joint Staff, Pentagon, is truly a most satisfying job experience. When our people go home from each shift, they know that they have contributed to our national security.
(U//FOUO) If you are interested in pursuing job opportunities at the Pentagon, see the recent announcement .
