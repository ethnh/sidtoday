(U) Note: Here's another in our Friday "human interest article" series...
(U) As you may have noticed, each SID today article comes with a feedback button, so readers can tell us what they think of the article. Typically, we receive a few comments about each, but a select few have sent people reaching en masse to click on that "feedback" button. This feedback might be good or bad or any point in between.
(U//FOUO) So, what are our top-5 SID today articles in the feedback department, to date? Here's the rundown:

1. (U//FOUO) Tales From the EN-Crypt! (How to Get Your PKI Certificate) (This subject had near-universal relevance and generated some questions. There was also a follow-up article .)
2. (U) Leadership: Your View of People (Charles Berlin's views on leadership struck a chord with many readers.)
3. (U) Congratulations to SID Promotees and Award Recipients! (An area of intense interest to many!)
4. (U) Media Leaks - Part I
5. (U) What Does a Leader Do? (Another of Mr. Berlin's articles on leadership.)
(U) See you next week!
