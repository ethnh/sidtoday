(U//FOUO) Register for the Worldwide HPCP Conference, 27-31 October

FROM: CW4
HPCP Analysis Cell
Run Date: 09/15/2003
(U//FOUO) The Meade Operations Center's HPCP Analysis Cell (HAC), sponsored by SIGDEV Strategy and Governance (SSG), is hosting a Worldwide HPCP Conference from 27 to 31 October 2003. The conference will be held at the Symposium Center in the R\&E; building on the main NSA campus.
(U//FOUO) The classification level is TOP SECRET//COMINT/TK. This will be the first HPCP conference; it was decided that due to the disparate HPCP collection efforts necessitated by OIF (Operation IRAQI FREEDOM) the Intelligence Community needed to orchestrate a cohesive plan of attack, as well as inform the Intelligence Community of all HPCP efforts across the board.

# (U) INTENT 

(S//SI) HPCP communications are increasing exponentially worldwide. This technology is becoming a dominant form of communications in many areas of interest for both tactical and strategic customers, providing a unique way of finding and exploiting targets that cannot be replicated through other SIGINT accesses. The need to understand this technology has been compounded by the need to provide force protection in Iraq. Emphasis on metadata analysis and target development is paramount in prosecuting the targets using this technology.
(S//SI) The HAC, founded by SSG in May 2003 to provide the community a focal point for HPCP issues, is hosting this conference to coordinate the HPCP effort, eliminate duplication of effort, and facilitate the sharing of information and technology throughout the Intelligence Community. Although attendance is filling up fast, conference registration is still available at the Conference Website (or type "go hpcp").
