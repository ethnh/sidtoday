(U) Chef's Choice: What's SID Doing About Transformation 2.0?

(S//SI) Lt Gen Hayden recently unveiled the Agency's Transformation 2.0 plan designed to more fully optimize SIGINT for the nation. You may be wondering... "How well is SID moving forward on this initiative?" The good news is that while the challenges in Transformation 2.0 are very formidable indeed, we are actually already engaged. One of the most significant changes since the stand-up of SID is the establishment of our new Issue Manager Team (IMT) effort. The IMTs (see their IMT/WISE webpage ) are already engaged, and helping to lead the way ahead. The IMT construct responds directly to General Hayden's assertion that SIGINT is a team sport; however, as with most new start-ups we are at various stages of the crawl, walk, run progression. So how, specifically, do the IMTs support the goals of Transformation 2.0?
(S//SI) Transformation 2.0 calls for extensive information sharing and teaming with a wide variety of partner and client organizations. These can be grouped into four categories:

1. Within NSA (across SID, and between SID and IAD and of course the enabler organizations);
2. Across the Cryptologic Enterprise, to include RSOCs, Mission Ground Sites, Field Entities, Tactical Units, and Foreign Partners;
3. Within the Intelligence Community (our collaborating partners CIA, DIA, NIMA, NRO etc.);
4. With our Clients (military commands, policy makers, law enforcement agencies, Homeland Security, and perhaps industry).

IMTs are working hard to bring about seamless cooperation not just within SID but also across the entire SIGINT Enterprise (petals one and two). Experience has proven that this approach delivers high levels of performance and customer satisfaction - the great success of the Iraq IMT is an illustrative example of this "teaming" in action. Our vision is that as we move forward, the IMTs will play an equally important role with petals three and four, which address horizontal integration with our intelligence community partners and with our major clients worldwide.
(S//SI) Before we can truly optimize the SIGINT system, we must fully understand national priorities and what we are being asked to do in the context of our customers' intelligence requirements. This raises another, albeit less obvious, information sharing dimension. Transformation 2.0 and "information sharing" are about more than the flow of SIGINT: they are also about coming to a comprehensive understanding of what the customer really wants and then delivering it. The goal is not merely to respond to information needs; it is to be confident every day that we are working the highest national priorities, certain that we are absolutely focused on what the nation needs most. The IMTs, along with the Requirements Analysis Center, will help us focus on the information needs and determine whether SIGINT, or another "INT", is best suited for providing intelligence on a given topic.
(S//SI) We are confident that the IMTs will help leverage the SIGINT system to an even higher level of performance. We have identified 14 IMTs, and hand-picked 40 senior analysts to serve in this capacity. The IMTs are not identical in structure - some are fulltime, some are part-time but they all share common goals. SID leadership recognizes this is a significant investment of highly skilled resources, and the fact that we are willing to invest this level of expertise underscores the value and importance of these positions. In the past, we have hired consulting firms to make "system-wide" assessments. These assessments were always insightful and helpful, but unfortunately they were one-off efforts that could not be sustained on a day-to-day basis. To provide the dynamic focus we need today, we are engaging our own experts to help identify problems and take advantage of opportunities to work with all of our resources and partners. The IMTs are here to stay - this is not a one-time event; they will be a continuous
presence to assist in the process of optimizing the SIGINT system.
(S//SI) Needless to say, all of this is a tall order; however, as the IMTs progress in their work, I believe we will be positioned to reach new heights of success. I encourage you to support them in every way possible - the outcome will be what our nation deserves: sustainment of the very best SIGINT products and services.
