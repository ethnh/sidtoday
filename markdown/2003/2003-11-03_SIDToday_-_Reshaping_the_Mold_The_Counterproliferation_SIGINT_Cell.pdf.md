(S//SI) Reshaping the Mold: The Counterproliferation SIGINT Cell
FROM:
Counterproliferation SIGINT Cell
Run Date: 11/03/2003
(S//SI) As part of a larger initiative to improve the Intelligence Community's efforts to counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction and expand the sharing of information between agencies, NSA and CIA have created a joint Counterproliferation SIGINT Cell . The Cell is composed of CIA officers and NSA analysts cross-trained on the other Agency's policies, systems, and tools and with full access to the data of both agencies from CIA spaces.
(S//SI) Yes, that's right, we'll be doing SIGINT from the CIA. Toiling in the basement of CIA Headquarters, we'll be correlating what we see and task on the SIGINT side with what the CIA's Directorate of Operations is working on from the HUMINT side. This lead-sharing effort focuses on the exploitation of a high-priority non-state nuclear proliferation network led by A.Q. Khan, a network that cut its teeth by supplying the Pakistani nuclear program.
(S//SI) The Cell will also become the center for NSA analysis and reporting on the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and the OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons). This portion of the mission will consolidate and provide a cohesive focus to reporting on international organizations key to counterproliferation which are currently either under-reported, or reported in ad hoc fashion by more than a dozen separate A\&P; elements.
(S//SI) So who are the intrepid souls (or merely foolish mortals?) who dare to take this first step into the swamp of information sharing? Insert your favorite literary or allegorical story here, but this six-person team includes two former Russian linguists, analysts who've worked for DIA and NIMA, been assigned to the Defense HUMINT Service, NSOC and KRSOC, and have expertise on SIGDEV and SIGINT reporting, chemical weapons and the OPCW, the proliferation target in general and the A.Q. Khan network in particular.
(U//FOUO) Now, immunized with the protective shield of USSID 18 briefings, having upgraded their skill levels, armed with many new weapons and tools, and poised in front of multiple computer systems, our troupe is ready to begin their mission and reshape the way the SIGINT and HUMINT system interact to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The journey begins.....
