# (U) Coming Attractions 

FROM: SIGINT Communications

Run Date: 09/26/2003
(U//FOUO) We'd like to take this opportunity to tell you about some new features that you'll be seeing in SID today. First, starting soon, you can expect to see a series of regular articles from SID-level managers - SID Director MG Quirk, Deputy Director Charlie Meals, and SID Chief of Staff Charles Berlin - who will tell you, from their unique perspectives, of the important events happening in the directorate. We think that this will help keep you well informed of developments that may affect all of SID. We anticipate that articles from MG Quirk and Charlie Meals will run monthly, and items from Charles Berlin semi-monthly (or fortnightly?).
(U//FOUO) There are some other changes you will see. We will soon have available a "Submit an Article Idea" button on the page, as well as a "Letter to the Editor" feature to let readers comment on issues raised in SID today. In addition, we expect to post a form for submitting requests for the release of SID-all email messages.
(U//FOUO) Finally, since articles often appear for only a day before disappearing into the archives, we will start posting a list of "Recent Articles" at the bottom of the SID today homepage. This should make it easier to catch up on articles you may have missed if you haven't visited the page for a few days. (Thanks to our colleagues in Multimedia Solutions for making all this possible.)
(U//FOUO) We hope you like the new features - let us know if you have other suggestions.
