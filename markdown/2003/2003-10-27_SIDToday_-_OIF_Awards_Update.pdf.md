# (U) OIF Awards Update 

FROM:
SID Workforce Performance Management Executive
Run Date: 10/27/2003
(U//FOUO) We again would like to thank everyone for all the hard work for both supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and for playing position so that OIF could be such a SIGINT success. Although many have received awards recently for both efforts, we would like to highlight the OIF award results because of the special funding involved. As you know from previous correspondence, NSA received $\$ 2.5$ million from Congress as a sign of appreciation for our contributions to OIF. SID initially received $\$ 528,000$, but this was eventually supplemented with some of the funds from the other "pots" and SID ultimately received about $\$ 1$ million in funding.
(U//FOUO) SID gave out 124 team awards, which included cash awards of varying amounts to 825 people and hundreds of Time-Off Awards and Letters of Appreciation (LOA) from the SIGINT Director. In addition, SID awarded 71 individual awards - although teaming was a major theme throughout the write-ups. The military are also being rewarded for their OIF efforts: to date, 194 JSAMs, 33 JSCMs, and 4 DMSMs** have been written and more are coming in all the time. There have also been hundreds of Time-Off awards, LOAs, and STAR awards for the military.
(U//FOUO) SID tried to have a fair and balanced process to level the playing field so that like accomplishments were rewarded with like compensation. This was done through our normal award processes. Therefore, SID has decided not to publish the list of OIF award recipients.
