(U//FOUO) Do you have an opinion you'd like to share with your fellow SID'ers? Here's your opportunity: SID today is looking for guest editorialists. If you have thought-provoking ideas, wry observations, or something important to tell the workforce, reach for your pen!
(U//FOUO) We ask that you submit your editorial via the "Submit an Item/ SIDtoday Article" function on the right side of the SID today homepage. A few guidelines:

- The editorial should be at least somewhat work-related;
- It should be reasonably concise;
- It should be of general interest to the SID population.
(U//FOUO) Additional writing tips can be found in the "submission guidelines," which can be found at the bottom of the SID today homepage. We can't promise that every submission will be published, but we will give all articles the consideration they deserve. Looking forward to hearing from you!
