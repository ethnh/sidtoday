(U) The Bald Truth: The Sweet Conspiracy

FROM: Charles H. Berlin III
SID Chief of Staff
Run Date: 11/14/2003
(U) One of my leadership tenets is: Excellence is having a stake in someone else's success . I contend that you are never excellent if you merely perfect your area of responsibility. It is not until you reach out to make sure the next guy looks good that you break into the band of excellence. I even ask my subordinates to specifically target someone for success and take him or her on as a personal project. This takes the whole thing to a practical level. I have seen people competing with one another as to who can make who look better. It is a powerful positive cycle. It makes people work for something other than themselves and is generally healthier in the end.
(U) But I today want to talk about targeting your boss for success. Yes, that's right, your boss. Unfortunately, our cynical nature has branded working hard for the boss as automatically some kind of sycophantic, self-promoting evil. While every organization has its share of suck-ups, we really need to allow the boss some prerogatives to chart the future, and accept our responsibility to work hard to achieve that vision. Let's develop a sweet conspiracy to make the boss (and the organization) look good. This will be more important as you mature and you are able to see the boss's shortcomings. It is always a shock when you finally figure out the boss is human and trying hard to make up for his weaknesses sometimes by covering them up, sometimes with a bit of bluster and sometimes with denial. A good subordinate should conspire to fill the gaps. In my case it takes a village to get together and cover my personal weaknesses (ask my front office!), but there is nothing wrong with getting the gang together and figuring out how to support the boss. Give it a try.
(U) On a personal level, consider this: how about making your competition look good? Yeah, I know that next promotion will either go to you or that other guy. Can you rise above the peer-topeer competition to unselfishly help the other guy? This is probably a radical idea but let me tell you, people like me in leadership positions do this and look for it in junior people as a sign of 'getting it'. I am in the business of evaluating and judging people - trying to figure out their potential. When I see the signs of excellence displayed in a dedication to someone else's success I really take note. In the end you must strive for significance instead of just success. Your pay grade may indicate success, but the people you have helped along the way measure significance. Are you a significant person? Let me know.
