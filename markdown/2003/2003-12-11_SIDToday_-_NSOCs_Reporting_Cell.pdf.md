(U//FOUO) NSOC's Reporting Cell
FROM: Customer Response (S12) Staff Officer Run Date: $12 / 11 / 2003$
(C) NSOC is where the action is. During periods of intense diplomatic or military activity, there is no better place to be in the thick of it. Each and every NSOC desk represents a larger Agency element, and together the 36 desk officers working a given shift capture the extremely diverse yet coordinated functions of approximately 15,000 people. Witnessing and participating in this coordinated effort provides a top-down perspective no "Intro to NSA" class or Power Point briefing can even come close to portraying.
(U//FOUO) The Reporting Cell in NSOC is home to the Senior Reporting Officer (SRO) and the Reporting Officer (RO). These two individuals reside less than 20 feet from the Senior Operations Officer (SOO) who is DIRSNA after-hours; and, together, these three individuals are the only NSOC representatives authorized to act on behalf of the Chief of Customer Response (CR). The SOO relies on the Reporting Cell to keep him/her abreast of recent reporting and dissemination issues. Additionally, the SRO and RO work intimately with other desks to ensure that authorized customers receive needed intelligence legally, securely, reliably, accountably, and on time.
(U//FOUO) These individuals are involved in everything from reviewing electrical product for sensitive content and compliance with USSIDs, to composing and sending time-sensitive reports whose critical nature can require that the President of the United States be immediately alerted - even woken up! The Reporting Cell interacts with other SID desks representing every product line and collection capability, as well as field sites, RSOCs and Second Party Partners. While there are indeed moments when one can hardly catch one's breath, there are also those when one has time to collaborate with and learn from mission elements not usually accessible to a day-shop position. There is no better place to learn how this Agency accomplishes its mission.
(U//FOUO) But what about the shift-work? This seems to be the major reason most individuals are unwilling to pursue a tour in NSOC. Waking up earlier than the crack of dawn to take on a day shift or staying up all night for a mid may be as appealing as a trip to the dentist, but there ARE advantages to the shift schedule. The camaraderie that comes hand-in-hand with working day-in, day-out, night-in, night-out with IC (Intelligence Community) professionals on the same rotating schedule is unparalleled, and being part of a close-knit team is both personally and professionally rewarding. When on "straight days," Reporting Cell members have the option to work within any CR mission element or A\&P: target office he/she chooses, to enjoy coordinated trips or tours with his/her team (CIA, NIMA), to take classes or to use leave.
(U//FOUO) When not on duty, the SRO and RO are part of the many get-togethers NSOCers enjoy to underscore the reality that just because one may be maintaining a far-from-traditional schedule (and possibly having to put extra effort into keeping up with one's family and friends), one is not without a fulfilling social life - and family! Other benefits include premium pay for nights and weekends, and - one of the best - that you only work an 8 -hour shift, after which someone else relieves you to take on whatever loose thread may be hanging. What you leave behind is not waiting for your return to the office!
(U//FOUO) SROs and ROs are afforded a truly unique opportunity not only to learn what is policy vs. what is myth, but also to drive the very same system they work within on a daily basis. That SRO and RO alumni reside at every level of NSA/CSS leadership is testimony to the fact that taking on a Reporting Cell tour is among the most valuable career development opportunities out there. Don't miss out.
