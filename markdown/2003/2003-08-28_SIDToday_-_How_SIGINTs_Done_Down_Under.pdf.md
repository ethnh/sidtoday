(U//FOUO) How SIGINT's Done Down Under!
FROM:
Acting CDO for Australia
Run Date: 08/28/2003
(S//SI) "G'day mate" is the hearty greeting from NSA's Australian counterpart, the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD), where it's already tomorrow. NSA's partnership with DSD is rich in history, cooperation, coordination, and value. At over 1100 strong, DSD's mixed civilian-military workforce brings much SIGINT muscle to the partnership - with DSD handling all reporting responsibility for several specific targets, including Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. In the wake of September 11th, DSD, like NSA's other Second Party partners, stepped in to carry more of the SIGINT load, thus freeing additional NSA resources to focus on the global war against terrorism.
(S//SI) During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the joint DSD-NSA facility at Alice Springs contributed valuable intelligence in support of combined operations in Iraq, which included Australian forces. As the bombing in Bali in October 2002 and the recent bombing in Jakarta demonstrate, terrorism is an issue in DSD's own backyard as well and the cooperation between NSA and DSD counterterrorism offices is close, continuing, and interdependent.
(S//SI) DSD's varied collection capabilities, including overhead, satellite, and special collection sites, provide valuable accesses not otherwise available to satisfy U.S. intelligence requirements. In fact, over $15 \%$ of DSD's annual budget is spent directly in support of U.S. intelligence requirements. Recently, members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence visited Australia to see first-hand the value of the intelligence relationship and express our nation's thanks for Australia's support. Future prospects for expanding the NSA-DSD SIGINT relationship include computer network exploitation, close access, hard targets, special collection, and divisions of effort on regional targets. Planning is currently underway for the annual NSA-DSD bilateral conference, of which SIGINT issues are a large part.
(S//SI) This robust relationship is encouraged and supported by a Special U.S. Liaison Officer and staff in Canberra as well as an Australian Liaison Officer and staff here at NSA. Several Australian integrees populate NSA offices and NSA employees are integrated at DSD as well. Approximately 50\% of the personnel at the joint DSD-NSA facility at Alice Springs are NSA employees and Australians are integrated throughout the wider SIGINT enterprise, providing for a lively and beneficial exchange of SIGINT ideas, products, and services.
