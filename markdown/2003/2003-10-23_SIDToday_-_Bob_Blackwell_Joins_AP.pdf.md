Run Date: 10/23/2003
(C) After a long career in CIA, I am delighted to have an opportunity to serve in NSA. Despite the commute ( 90 miles every day), I am excited to be here and happy to be working with Jim Allen and the rest of A\&P:'s leadership. I am working hard, but realize that I still have a lot to learn. Fortunately, everyone is pitching in to help me. I intend to get around to the Product Lines on a reasonably frequent basis and see how SIGINT is created.
