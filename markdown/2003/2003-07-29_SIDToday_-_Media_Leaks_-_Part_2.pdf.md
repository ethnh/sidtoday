(U//FOUO) The following is the conclusion of our article on Cryptologic Insecurities. If you missed part 1, click HERE to see it.
(U) What Happens When a CI Is Discovered?
(U) Once there is a CI, what happens? If a first-time disclosure of classified NSA information appears in press, NSA's Public Affairs Office notifies DIRNSA and prepares notification letters to the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). NSA's Office of the General Counsel (OGC) advises DIRNSA whether the matter involves a possible criminal case; if so, it is referred to the DOD General Counsel, and then finally to the Department of Justice for investigation.
(U) Media leaks are rarely prosecuted. Why? Often because they are hard to prove, but in some cases officials are reluctant to prosecute for fear that the case will attract even more attention than the original disclosure. (Nevertheless, people who release classified information without authorization are subject to a range of punishments, from loss of clearance to dismissal to criminal prosecution.) Meanwhile, the OPI at NSA scrambles to minimize (if possible) the damage from the disclosure, and informs its customers that our capabilities may take a hit.

# (U) What Is My Role? 

(S//SI) Obviously, Cryptologic Insecurities constitute a real danger to our ability to produce SIGINT. What can you do about it?

- Stay alert for reflections of impairment or denial-or-deception practices by our adversaries in your target traffic.
- If you note an impairment of NSA's ability to collect against a target, please notify Intelligence Security Issues. They will try to determine if there was a CI.
- When watching/reading press reports, remain conscious of potential reflections of SIGINT information. If you suspect an unauthorized disclosure of classified NSA information, notify Intelligence Security Issues.
