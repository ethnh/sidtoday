(U//FOUO) The SID leadership is proud to announce the newly reinvigorated Pacific Technical Center (PTC), located at NSA/CSS Representative Japan (NCRJ) in Yokota Air Base, Japan. The new PTC will act as the sister organization to the highly successful European Technical Center (ETC), providing essential technical and logistical services to vital cryptologic missions in the Pacific Theater.
(S//SI) Since its establishment in 1959, NCRJ has supported the NSA SIGINT mission by providing operational and technical assistance primarily to its Japanese Third Party partner and US military components in Japan. It also assists other Pacific Theater partners at the request of the respective NSA/CSS Representatives and US military components outside of Japan. This latter technical support has been ad hoc in nature and--excluding internal support to NCRJ itself--has grown to the point that it is on the same level or even surpasses the level of technical support provided internal to Japan. The PTC, an office of NCRJ, provides the technical support mentioned above. Besides supporting new initiatives, the PTC supports critical capabilities for: Global War on Terrorism, Homeland Defense, PRC/NKOR military comms, crime \& narcotics, etc.
(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Director recently tasked Chief, NCRJ to identify what would be required for the PTC to operate in the Pacific Theater the way the ETC operates in the European Theater. While the NCRJ technical support division has provided these services for many years, SID leadership has decided that world events and new strategic thrusts warrant a new infusion of money and manpower to support this all-important mission. With new uncertainties on the Korean peninsula, continued high interest in the PRC, new endeavors in SIGINT Development and a terrorist trail leading more and more into east Asia, it is crucial that the US Cryptologic System (USCS) remain healthy and poised to prosecute these Pacific Theater missions. Billets now being advertised represent the additional manpower to augment NCRJ in its early evolution of the PTC. This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a new Pacific support concept; a chance to make a real contribution to the mission of the USCS in the Pacific.
(U//FOUO) The PTC currently has several vacancies for talented technical professionals in SIGINT Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering, and Computer Science. These vacancies are advertised in the Field Vacancy book published on 11 July. Additionally, NCRJ has vacancies for Intelligence/Network Analysts, Signals Analysts and SIGINT Liaison Officers at Misawa, Tokyo, Yokota and Okinawa. This is an ideal opportunity for individuals who are good at solving technical and analytical problems and who are interested in keeping the mission afloat to step forward and be counted.
(U//FOUO) For individuals interested in traveling, Japan offers a great jumping off point to Asia and the South Pacific. Take the plunge, help shape the new PTC, provide hands-on support to critical missions and see the Far East and Pacific!
