(U//FOUO) Second Party SIGINT Directors Hold Virtual Meeting
FROM:
SIGINT Planning and Forecasting (S01X2)
Run Date: 12/19/2003
(U//FOUO) SID and Second Party SIGINT seniors (MG Quirk and his counterparts from CSE, DSD and GCSB) recently held their first "virtual" meeting using the InfoWorkSpace (IWS) tool. (GCHQ was unable to attend due to a computer failure.) As noted in a previous SIDtoday article , the tool allows voice conversation, messaging, collaboration on documents, etc. The decision to hold this and subsequent meetings was made by the leadership group as a way to work together to advance the 5-Eyes Business Vision, which they prepared earlier this year.
(U//FOUO) Most of the IWS discussion, which lasted over an hour, was centered on efforts against terrorism, especially ways to extend cooperation across the SIGINT community, and to include the HUMINT community. The leaders agreed to schedule another session around the middle of January.
