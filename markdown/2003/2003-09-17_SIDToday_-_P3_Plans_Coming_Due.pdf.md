# (U//FOUO) P3 Plans Coming Due 

FROM: Charles H. Berlin III
SID Chief of Staff
Run Date: 09/17/2003
(U//FOUO) First, I would like to thank those of you who have sent your P3 plans to SID's Workforce Performance Management Executive, $\square$ . She has about $65 \%$ of them. The rest of you must have a P3 plan in place by 1 October 2003 ( 90 days before the end of the P3 cycle, 31 December).
(U//FOUO) P3 objectives are key to all personnel understanding their job and performance expectations. The reason I would like your P3 plan on file is that SID intends to do quality assessments at some point, and this cannot be done without the P3 itself. SID needs the actual P3 on file. There are no employee-manager privacy issues that should prevent compliance with this request.
(U//FOUO) If you have a P3 plan but have not sent it in, please do so before the deadline. If you do not have a plan, please meet with your supervisor, develop your plan, and send it to $\square$
(U//FOUO) Managers with employees who have not forwarded their P3 plans by 1 October will receive a low rating of "2" for the mandatory management objectives on their P3s. $\square$ is checking off names as the P3 plans come in and will go to managers for accountability.
(U//FOUO) Please send your P3 plan to $\square$ either via email (please put "P3" on the subject line) or the NSA mail system (suite 6378), or hand carry your plan to HQ, Room 5A172.
(U) Thanks to all of you for this effort. We are making important progress.
