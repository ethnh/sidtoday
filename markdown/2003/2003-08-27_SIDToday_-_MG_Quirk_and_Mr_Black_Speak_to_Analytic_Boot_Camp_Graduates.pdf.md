(U//FOUO) Last Thursday, MG Quirk and NSA Deputy Director Black spoke to recent graduates of the Analytic Boot Camp. The SIGINT Director kicked off the event by providing some of his perspective on the future of SIGINT and its role in national defense, answering a few questions from the audience about organizational restructure and fiscal oversight, and introducing the Deputy Director, Mr. Bill Black.
(U//FOUO) Mr. Black shared his views about the Agency's past, present, and future. "Going into space was a challenge of the last generation; NASA and NRO met that challenge. This generation's challenge is mastering the cyberspace; NSA will be instrumental in keeping America in the lead there too," Mr. Black told the audience. He shared his perspective that NSA is changing from a collector of information to a provider of intelligence throughout the community, and cited several examples of how policymakers and warfighters rely on SIGINT for their decision-making. Mr. Black closed his remarks by reminding the audience that "now is a great time to be working with NSA as the Agency regains its dominance in software and technology."
