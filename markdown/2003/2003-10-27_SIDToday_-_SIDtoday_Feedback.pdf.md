# (U) SIDtoday Feedback 

FROM: SIGINT Communications
Unknown
Run Date: 10/27/2003
(U//FOUO) It's been quiet... TOO quiet! Late last week we discovered that the feedback function for SIDtoday articles had been down for several days. The problem is now fixed, but if you sent feedback from Oct. 21 - this morning (Oct. 27), regretfully we did not receive it. We would still like to hear your thoughts - if you have comments about a recent article (links to recent articles can be found at the bottom of the SIDtoday Homepage), please drop us a note!

## "(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet without the consent of S0121 (DL sid_comms)."
