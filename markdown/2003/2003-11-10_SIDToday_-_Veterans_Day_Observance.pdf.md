(U) Veteran's Day Observance

FROM: SGM
SID Senior Enlisted Advisor
Run Date: 11/10/2003
(U) As the new SID SEA, I am humbled to be with you today as a part of such a great organization. I appreciate the efforts of both the military and civilian personnel that have made the Signals Intelligence Directorate an integral part of the National Security Agency and the United States SIGINT system. I am also honored to share my thoughts on Veteran's Day with each of you. Veteran's Day sparks childhood memories of learning the Pledge of Allegiance and standing for the National Anthem. Even at a young age, I appreciated patriotism, but it wasn't until much later that I learned the meaning of Veteran's Day. Yes, we studied the typical dates and places in school, however; the true meaning came over the last 27 years of military service to our nation.
(U) I have stood at the parades, listened to the speeches, and even cried at the ceremonies of soldiers that have given their lives. Words cannot convey the emotions I am filled with each time I hear the National Anthem played. From the striking of the first note, the hairs on my arms stand tall. While the music plays, it seems to bring a sense of pride and responsibility. My thoughts turn to the people who have given their lives and those that still serve today. Though the purpose of Veteran's Day is typically to honor America's living veterans and active forces, and Memorial Day is a time to remember our fallen veterans, I'd ask that you join me in a moment of silence, "Taps", and prayer during our national observance (as described below).

# (U) National Ceremonies Held at Arlington 

(U) The focal point for official, national ceremonies for Veteran's Day continues to be the memorial amphitheater built around the Tomb of the Unknowns. At 11 a.m. on November 11th, a combined color guard representing all military services executes "Present Arms" at the tomb. The nation's tribute to its war dead is symbolized by the laying of a presidential wreath. The bugler plays "Taps." The rest of the ceremony takes place in the amphitheater.
(U) Every year the President of the United States urges all Americans to honor the commitment of our veterans through appropriate public ceremonies. It is appropriate to include a moment of respect for those who gave their lives for their country.
