(U) Strengthening Our Analytic Capability

FROM:
Acting Deputy Director for Analysis and Production Run Date: 08/18/2003
(S//SI) Having spent the last 16 months in Analysis and Production, I have had the opportunity to witness firsthand the phenomenal job done by SIGINT analysts of all disciplines. From my previous positions at CIA and on the National Security Council, I know how important SIGINT was and is to our country's national security. My time here and interaction with our customers has deepened that appreciation. Our analysts have continually risen to the challenges of our changing world and demanding customers through their expertise, innovation, and sheer determination. We owe them our gratitude, and we are working to provide them the tradecraft training, analytic techniques, and tools they need to keep us ahead of our targets. I am convinced that SIGINT analysis and the analysts who perform it must be strongly supported and that we must work continuously to make our product even better.
(U//FOUO) We have commissioned a number of teams to work primarily in two areas: raising the tradecraft skills and expertise of all our people and increasing the analytic value added of our SIGINT product, whether it be end product to customers or SIGINT development work. While these efforts should be understood as continuous, with no obvious nirvana end-state, we are moving ahead on some specific short term goals:

- Under the auspices of our Advanced Analysis Lab, a group of our senior analysts are writing a paper on just what constitutes excellent analysis - and what are some of the elements that make our products truly useful, relevant, insightful and actionable. Through this paper we will set the standards - the bar - for excellent analytic product.
- Another team is developing a process for our experts to identify "exemplars" of our best products - whether Social Network analysis, a fused COMINT-Tech SIGINT report, an in-depth special assessment, or another vehicle. We will put examples of analysis that meet or exceed our standards for excellence on our Advanced Analysis Labs 'best practices" website.
- While there is nothing as useful as having excellent models to emulate, we are also working with the National Cryptologic School to revamp our analysis training curriculum in general and to develop a specific "high-end" course for experienced analysts.
- We are asking our Production Line managers to produce a production plan, that is, to identify those critical issues where we need analysts to research and write social network analyses and a continuing stream of assessment reports over the next year. Customer feedback from the Iraq campaign has again highlighted how valuable policymakers and warfighters find our analysis-rich

assessment reports. We will measure how well we do.

- And finally, we want to reward analytic achievement, and a team has completed a proposal for some new Deputy Director for Analysis and Production awards, including an annual award for Analytic/Technical Excellence.
(U//FOUO) I hope you see that there is a method and deliberate effort to emphasize the importance of our analytic value-added in our products and services. As a prelude to our first annual Analysis Conference, here at NSA from 25 to 28 August, we will present over the next several days a series of articles highlighting analytic techniques and learning opportunities. These articles only begin to scratch the surface of the important, creative approaches our analysts and second party colleagues are developing and employing. The Conference will allow us to dig a little deeper and to share the "best practices" that are being utilized in many corners of our extended analytic enterprise. I encourage all of you to attend the panel discussions, workshops, and briefings with an eye toward how you can apply the knowledge and techniques presented to your own target.
