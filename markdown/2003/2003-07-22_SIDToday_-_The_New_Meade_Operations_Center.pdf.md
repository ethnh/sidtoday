(U//FOUO) The New Meade Operations Center
FROM:
Deputy Director for Data Acquisition
Run Date: 07/22/2003
(S//SI) "The times, they are a changin'..." Over the past 5 months, a major effort on the part of SID, Extended Enterprise Management, and the Service Cryptologic Elements (SCEs) has laid the groundwork and started the transition of the National SIGINT Collection Center (NSCC) into the Meade Operations Center (MOC). The driving forces behind this transformation were the fragmentation over time of the tasks performed in the NSCC, to the extent that it had lost its identity; the lack of a clearly identified strategy on the NSCC's role and position in the SIGINT Enterprise, and plans by the SCEs to reallocate personnel resources from the NSCC into Transformation areas.
(S//SI) The Director's vision of the MOC is a capabilities-based, collection-focused element with specific responsibility for exploiting midpoint access, both RF and cable. The MOC has ceased collection of many legacy targets determined at a corporate level to be either of little value, or duplicated elsewhere. This has allowed the MOC to devote its remaining personnel and resources to new SIGINT Development tasks with a trans-national emphasis.
