(U//FOUO) Jim Allen, the Deputy Director for Analysis and Production, held his first Town Meeting for the S2 work force on 27 October 2003. He billed the event as a progress report on what he had been up to since his arrival in late August. He reported that he has:

- Contacted customers and partners
- Met with the work force
- Learned about the organization and its processes
- Hosted an S2 Senior Leadership Offsite
- Represented NSA on the Horizontal Integration Management Group
(U//FOUO) What had he discovered? He found the mission to be in good hands, running well, and moving on the right vector. He did, however, see a need to work on clarity of roles, responsibilities, and processes in S2, and a need to improve our connections with the extended analytic enterprise. Mr. Allen also acknowledged that space for the work force is a big problem.
(U//FOUO) Jim Allen addressed again his five priorities:
- Personnel development
- Acquisition and development
- Resource levels
- Executing the Network Attack Mission
- Transformation 2.0
(U//FOUO) Regarding future plans, Mr. Allen said that he would work at an accelerated pace on his priorities and work to ensure that S2's processes were responsive to the needs of leadership and the work force. He wanted to make himself more available to the work force and would be dropping in on them as often as he could. He also noted that he intended to optimize the role of Technical Directors in S2, thus enabling the best use of this important talent. He stated that the town meeting was but one avenue he would use in communicating with the work force: he intends to use multiple media paths in his communication campaign.
(U//FOUO) The town meeting slides have been posted for review.
