(U//FOUO) SID Needs Your Help: Take 5 Minutes
FROM: Charles H. Berlin
SIGINT Directorate Chief of Staff
Run Date: 12/09/2003
(U//FOUO) The NSA inventory of accountable property (mandated by DoD Regulations) will end 31 Dec 2003. We must account for all IT equipment - computers, laptops, and palmtops - as well as plant property such as recorders, generators, and demodulators with a value of $\$ 5,000.00$ or more.
(U//FOUO) I am personally asking every SID person (civilian, military, integree and contractor to take 5 minutes today to assist in completing this important task. The only acceptable goal is to account for $\mathbf{1 0 0 \%}$ of SID property.
(U//FOUO) Here is what I need you to do:

1. Copy down the NSA ID barcodes (5 numbers and a letter) on the tag with red corners at bottom of tag (see picture on SIDtoday) on all equipment in your immediate area. This includes your workstation, any laptop/palmtop, and any equipment with a NSA ID. (DO NOT look at barcodes starting with "EA", "I" or "N" - only NSA IDs).
2. Check the "Missing Equipment" list which is provided by both barcode number and room number on the Property Accounting website;
3. If you find any matching barcodes, send an email to $\square$ in the SID Property Office.

Include:

- the NSA ID, Serial Number,
- the organization,
- building,
- room number,
- column number and
- a POC in the room where the equipment is located.

If you find the area has several "missing" items, simply state that in your email, along with a request for a SID Property Officer to assist with the inventory.
(U//FOUO) Failure to complete this inventory is not an option. We need a concentrated effort in this last push to locate missing equipment. Everyone's cooperation and assistance is greatly appreciated.
