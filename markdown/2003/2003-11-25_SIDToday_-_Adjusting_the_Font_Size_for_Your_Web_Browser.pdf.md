(U) Some readers have commented that they would prefer a different font size for the articles that appear in SIDtoday. Did you know that you can set the font size to whatever level is best for you? Here's how:
(U) In Netscape:

- 1) Go to the "Edit" menu and select "Preferences"
- 2) In the "Category" box, select "Appearance--> Fonts"
- 3) The coding for the SIDtoday page is "Variable Width Font"; select the size that you prefer
- 4) Then click on the option that says "Use my default fonts, overriding documentspecified fonts"
- 5) Click on "OK"... and you are done!
(U) If you wish to revert to the document-specified fonts, at step 4, click on "Use documentspecified fonts, including dynamic fonts" option, and click "OK".
(U) In Explorer:
- 1) Go to the "View" menu
- 2) Select the "Text Size" option and choose the size (the options are larger, largest, smaller, smallest) that you prefer
(U) Done!
