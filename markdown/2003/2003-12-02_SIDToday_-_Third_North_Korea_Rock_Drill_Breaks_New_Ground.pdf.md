(S//SI) Third North Korea Rock Drill Breaks New Ground
FROM: the North Korea Issue Management Team (IMT)

Run Date: 12/02/2003
(S//SI) An article in today's NSA Daily discusses North Korea Rock Drill 3, held from 12 to 14 November. Further detail is provided below:
(S//SI) What made Rock Drill 3 especially unique was the fact that the primary "operator" being supported was a non-military entity - the U.S. State Department. Developing a Cryptologic Support Plan (CSP) for a non-military operator was a first for NSA/CSS and thus created a rich learning opportunity for everyone involved. One of the first lessons learned was that unlike military commands, the State Department does not develop Operations Plans (OPLAN) with clearly outlined goals and objectives. The dynamic nature of their negotiations and planning precludes such detailed documentation. Through close collaboration with State Department's East Asia/Pacific and INR (Intelligence and Research) bureaus, the NK IMT gained an understanding of State Department's objectives vis- $\AA$-vis North Korea and used that understanding as the basis for building a CSP. The lack of an existing OPLAN, however, soon led to the coining of a new term, "Cryptologic Support Strategy," to distinguish it from a traditional CSP.
(S//SI) The first day of Rock Drill 3 focused on a review of the draft Cryptologic Support Strategy (CSS). The participants provided significant input, propelling the CSS to an eighty percent completion point, while providing valuable suggestions on how to bring the CSS to completion. On the second and third days of the Rock Drill, participants were led through a series of six scenarios, crafted to elicit State Department views on likely responses to a wide range of North Korean behaviors and to test the Cryptologic system's ability to respond. The energy and enthusiasm sparked by the review of scenarios was palpable and afforded much greater insight into the State Department's plans as well as into NSA/CSS capabilities to support them.
(S//SI) By all accounts Rock Drill 3 was a great success with many tangible results:

- The first Cryptologic Support Strategy (80\% complete) for a non-military entity;
- Greater visibility into the State Department's decision space vis-a-vis North Korea;
- A deeper appreciation of the interdependencies of each of the operators in North Korea (State Department, USFK and PACOM) and an increased understanding of their objectives;
- A better understanding of NSA/CSS capabilities to respond to State Department needs and identification of steps to improve the overall posture;
- State Department commitment to continual collaboration with NSA/CSS on plans and intentions in order to optimize the SIGINT system;
- And, finally, the stated desire of DIA participants to run multi-int ROCK DRILLs focused on North Korea after participating in ours.
(U//FOUO) Maintaining the momentum, the Korea IMT is currently developing plans for ROCK DRILL 4 in mid to late January 2004. More details on this event will be published soon on the Korea IMT Web page, accessible by typing "go nk."
