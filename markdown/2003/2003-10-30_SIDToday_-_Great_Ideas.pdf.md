(U) Great Ideas

FROM:
SIGINT Communications
Run Date: 10/30/2003
(U//FOUO) A couple of weeks ago, Charles Berlin, the SID Chief of Staff, and the Deputy Directorate Chiefs of Staff selected two ideas for implementation for the new SID Ideas program. The selection was difficult, but the decision criteria was based on ability to successfully implement and likelihood to positively affect the largest group of SID employees. The two ideas that were selected were:

1. A networking web page for new direct hires
2. Plain language supplements to complex legal documents such as E.O. 12333, NSD 42, and the Computer Security Act of 1987
(U//FOUO) Both of these ideas have the ability to provide long-term positive results to a large group of people. Every Agency employee was once a new employee, and all of us should be able to remember how overwhelming this place can be at first. The idea to provide an immediate networking base for new hires mirrors an already successful tool implemented by the Intern Program administrators. This idea allows direct hires to reap the same benefits. The plain language supplements to legal documents will affect every SID employee because we all have to sign them, and the complex legalese often prevents employees from fully comprehending the agreements they are signing. With plain language supplements, employees will be able to feel more comfortable about the commitments they are making.
(U//FOUO) Both of these projects are in the beginning stages of implementation. We look forward to continuing with this process, and to evaluating its success in the aftermath of the implementation.
(U//FOUO) A new set of ideas will soon be presented to the Chiefs of Staff, so send in your ideas! Let us know what you think! The more ideas, the merrier!
