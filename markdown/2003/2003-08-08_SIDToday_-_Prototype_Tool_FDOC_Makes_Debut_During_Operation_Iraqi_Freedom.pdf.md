(U//FOUO) Prototype Tool FDOC Makes Debut During Operation Iraqi Freedom

(S//SI) As part of our support to Operation Iraqi Freedom, SID has successfully used a prototype tool to better monitor our SIGINT operations and help managers make effective SIGINT planning decisions regarding Iraq. This prototype is called FOCUSED DEMONSTRATION Operational Capability, or FDOC. How does it work? First, by displaying live, aggregated data, FDOC allows us to compare our SIGINT posture (i.e. how we are using our collection and analytic resources) with the state of the signal environment. With this information, SID can respond quickly to changes in target behavior and adjust our collection and analysis as necessary.
(S//SI) Second, FDOC provides limited metrics that managers can use to gauge the overall effectiveness of our SIGINT operations. It makes it possible for the manager to compare what we are putting into an effort (collection and analysis resources expended) with the payoff (the level of customer satisfaction). This can be used to make both real-time changes to tasking and longer term, strategic decisions.
(S//SI) The current version (Increment 3) of FDOC was deployed to the National Security Operations Center (NSOC) and Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) the week of 16 June, and proved to be a valuable, timesaving tool. The Cryptologic Mission Management (CMM) office is putting FDOC through the "risk reduction" process, e.g. verifying the information security of the aggregated data, ensuring the tool complies with our technical and policy objectives, making sure the information addresses the needs of the users, etc. User feedback will help them refine FDOC's capabilities further. The tool will be provided in a series of deliveries, and may also be integrated with other key programs, such as the Knowledge System Prototype, Analyst Cockpit, and others.
(S//SI) Additional capability (Increment Four and Five) is scheduled for operational acceptance testing on 18 August 2003. Watch for further developments! For more information about FDOC, contact $\square$ or $\square$ or $\square$
