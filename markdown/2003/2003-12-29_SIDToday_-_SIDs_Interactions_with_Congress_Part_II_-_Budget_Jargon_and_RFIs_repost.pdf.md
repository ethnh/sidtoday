(U) SID's Interactions with Congress: Part II - Budget Jargon and RFIs (repost)

(U) Budget Jargon
(U//FOUO) As with everything else, the budget process has its own vocabulary. Here are a few terms you may hear:

- Fence : When NSA funding is fenced, it means we cannot spend those dollars until we satisfy certain requirements levied on us by Congress. Fences are associated with Congressional Directed Actions (CDAs).
- With/Without Prejudice : When a cut is taken "with prejudice", it means that NSA must take the cut from a specified project/program. If a cut is taken "without prejudice", we have the option of funding that program/project at the level we requested and taking that cut from elsewhere in the budget.
- A not A : Appropriated not Authorized. This occurs when the Appropriators provide funding for programs, but the Authorizers do not give NSA the authority to spend it.
- Hollow Authority : This occurs when the Authorizers give NSA the authority to spend funds, however, the Appropriators do not provide us the with the dollars.
- Congressional Member/Staffer : The "member" is the senator or congressman. The "staffer" is just that--one of his staff. The staffers are led by a "staff director". Sensitive classified information is sometimes shared only with the staff director and members of Congress--not with the staffers-- to limit distribution as much as possible.
(U) Which Congressional Staffers Do We Usually Deal With?
(U//FOUO) SID often works with specific congressional staffers, as follows:
- HPSCI: Riley Perdue (majority staffer) and Beth Larson (minority staffer)
- SSCI: Jim Barnett
- HAC-Defense: Steve Nixon
- SAC-Defense: Jennifer Chartrand
