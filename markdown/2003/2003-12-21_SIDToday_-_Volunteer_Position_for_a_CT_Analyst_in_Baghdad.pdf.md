(S) Volunteer Position for a CT Analyst in Baghdad

FROM: SIGINT Communications
Run Date: $12 / 21 / 2003$
(S) Are you interested in supporting the war on terrorism? If, so, a unique opportunity awaits you as a Counterterrorism (CT) subject matter expert supporting the Iraqi Survey Group (ISG) in Baghdad! The ISG, led by CIA and DIA, is responsible for the immediate exploitation of terrorist-related information and disruption of terrorist activities. Secondly, it handles the Document Exploitation (DOCEX) mission within Iraq. Literally tons of material has been collected throughout Iraq, both physical media and through interrogations. NSA supports this effort fully and has committed to staff two analytic ISG positions in Baghdad. While the ISG does not have a SIGINT mission, SIGINT analysts will look for SIGINT leads, provide reach-back into NSA databases, and provide the SIGINT perspective to ISG operations. The CT analyst will deploy in January 2004 for approximately 120 days.
(S) The selectee will, in all likelihood, be involved in the interrogation/questioning of potential leads (there is no language requirement for this position), the evaluation and analysis of interrogation reports and other HUMINT-based reports, and the review and evaluation of captured documents and computer files in an attempt to identify and construct networks of who the insurgents are, who they communicate with and, ultimately, their planning.
(S) After appropriate training, you will deploy to the Baghdad Survey Analysis Center, at the Baghdad International Airport, home to several of Saddam's former Palaces. The living conditions have improved significantly to include hot meals and adequate sleeping accommodations.
(U//FOUO) Successful applicants, for the initial and follow-on deployments, will follow both NSA TDY and DIA pre-deployment processing routines. DIA processing includes various briefings at the DIAC and a required weeklong pre-deployment TDY for training at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma or Ft. Bliss, Texas. During the week you will receive Iraqi AOR-required uniforms and equipment, weapons qualification training, and medical screening, to include all required immunizations. You will be issued all necessary chemical/biological protective gear. Additional weapons qualification may be needed at NSA prior to deployment. Both military and civilian personnel will receive entitlements in accordance with all applicable regulations and policies.
(U//FOUO) Interested civilians should forward a copy of their Internal Staffing Resume. Interested military personnel should forward a biographical sketch containing your name, rank, telephone number, current office and supervisor, military unit, and pertinent mission background information. All volunteers must also inform their appropriate supervisory chain of their interest in volunteering for this position. Send all applications to Deployment Services Account Manager, . Please use: "DOCEX / CT Requirement Volunteer" as the subject of your e-mail. All volunteer applications must be received by 7 January 2004.
