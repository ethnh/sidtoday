(U//FOUO) Join Charles Berlin, the SID Chief of Staff, for a Brown Bag Lunch tomorrow (7 Oct) from 1130-1230 in Ops 1, room 2C087. The topic of discussion is leadership.
(U//FOUO) As Mr. Berlin stated in his recent series of articles on leadership: "I will be having a brown bag lunch to discuss leadership in a group setting. What to do when your leadership is bad? Where do I get a mentor? Who am I to judge anyone? Why is being a leader so hard at NSA? Can I lead from an Enlighten newsgroup? Are leadership and collaboration mutually exclusive? These and the meaning of life can all be discussed - see you then."
