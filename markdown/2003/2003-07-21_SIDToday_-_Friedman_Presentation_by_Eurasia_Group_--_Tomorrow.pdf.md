(U//FOUO) Friedman Presentation by Eurasia Group -- Tomorrow FROM:
SINIO for Russia/Eurasia
Run Date: 07/21/2003
(U//FOUO) There will be a SINIO Council presentation on 22 July, 0900-1500 in Friedman Auditorium :
(U//FOUO) Ian Bremmer, head of Eurasia Group, and several colleagues will be coming to speak at NSA. Eurasia Group is a research and consulting firm that focuses on global political-risk analysis, as well as country-specific and industry research for emerging markets. The name is a bit deceiving, as their country research coverage includes more than 65 countries in Africa, East and Southeast Europe, Former Soviet Union, Latin America, Middle East, and Southeast and East Asia.
(U//FOUO) The National Intelligence Council has had Ian speak at various seminars, and Eurasia Group is currently doing research for the NIC which includes forward-looking "risk watches", several area studies with broad comparative focus, and a transnational political instability/financial crisis series.
(U//FOUO) Ian will speak about the country stability indices that they produce and give the background, strategy and methodology of that project as well as speak on three recent projects done by the Group:

- Energy Issues (to include many areas of the world such as Nigeria/L.A./Middle East/Caspian);
- Radicalism and Terrorism; and
- Iraqi reconstruction/stability/impact on the region
...all topics of great interest to the Community and NSA. Eurasia Group works with businesses, corporations, etc., so they will present a very broad and all-encompassing view.
(U//FOUO) Seating will be on a first come, first served basis.
