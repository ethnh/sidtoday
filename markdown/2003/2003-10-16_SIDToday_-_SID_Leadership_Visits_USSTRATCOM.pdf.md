(U) SID Leadership Visits USSTRATCOM

FROM:
Deputy Director for Customer Relationships
Run Date: 10/16/2003
(U//FOUO) Recently SID Director MG Quirk led a delegation from S1, S2, and S3 to visit one of our newest customers, U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). The purpose of our visit was to gain a better understanding of the USSTRATCOM mission and to begin building a relationship with this customer by exchanging information on their mission, their expectations for SIGINT support, and NSA's capabilities to respond to their requirements for products and services. We discussed these issues over the course of two days with Lt Gen Thomas Goslin, D/Commander USSTRATCOM; RADM James McArthur, Director Global Operations; Brig Gen Kim McKenzie, Director JFHQ-IO, RADL (s) Frank Drennan, Director Strike Plans, and several members of their staffs.
(U//FOUO) It is not entirely true to say that USSTRATCOM - located on the former Strategic Air Command (SAC) base in Omaha, Nebraska - is a new customer, since it assumed the missions of some former commands. Changes to the Unified Command Plan, approved by SECDEF and the President, disestablished USSPACECOM and created USNORTHCOM and USSTRATCOM on 1 October 2002. (See a related article for further background information.) In fact, one of the most fascinating aspects of the visit was learning about the complex and multifaceted mission that has been assigned to USSTRATCOM, a mission that demonstrates the virtual global nature of today's targets enabled by a highly networked world.
(U//FOUO) USSTRATCOM's primary responsibility to provide national preemptive options to the President and SECDEF will require an unprecedented level of global situational awareness. To carry out its planning and coordination roles, USSTRATCOM will in effect be a virtual component on the planning team of all other commands. During our visit, MG Quirk noted that USSTRATCOM "has a unique assortment of missions with unique alertment requirements." USSTRATCOM will continue to evolve its overarching, integrated operational concept and, on 4 January, report to the President and SECDEF on its status and readiness to fully assume these missions.
(U//FOUO) Over the next few months, SID organizations will be working with USSTRATCOM through the NCR to improve lines of communication, examine the skill and manning needs of the Cryptologic Service Group (CSG) serving USSTRATCOM, perform an intelligence needs assessment with the Command, and develop mutually beneficial information sharing and collaborative analytic activities. A USSTRATCOM survey team will visit NSA in the upcoming weeks to look at analytic tools and also determine where it would be mutually beneficial to integrate USSTRATCOM analysts into SID.
(U//FOUO) This highly successful visit resulted in both a better understanding of requirements and capabilities on the part of both USSTRATCOM and SID and set in motion a range of actions that will strengthen our partnership in achieving the desired SIGINT outcomes for this command and our nation.
