(U//FOUO) Welcome to the Data Acquisition Directorate. I am $\square$ $\square$ $\square$, the Director. My Deputy Director is Jim Cusick. We are both honored and excited to be leading this organization in our crucial mission. You, the work force, should be proud of what you are doing for the nation. During the middle of June we held two Town Meetings for the DA work force. Now we would like to give the rest of the NSA work force a Data Acquisition update. In the coming days you will read a series of four articles from the Data Acquisition Directorate. The series will begin with "The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC)." The CSRC is DA's "front door" when it comes to collection requirements. This article will also show our close working ties with Customer Relationships, Analysis and Production, and the Extended Enterprise.
(U//FOUO) The next two articles will discuss technologies. The challenges presented by new digital network technologies will be presented in "Digital Network Exploitation (DNE), Digital Network Intelligence (DNI), and Computer Network Exploitation (CNE)." "The Evolution of HF" clearly demonstrates the importance of one of the oldest means of communications. The final article addresses the transition of the National SIGINT Collection Center (NSCC) to the Meade Operations Center (MOC). This is just a small sample of what's going on in Data Acquisition. Watch our website for future articles.
(U//FOUO) If you have any questions or comments on any of these articles, or any suggestions for DA, please use the Submit Ideas button located on the Data Acquisition home page located HERE .
