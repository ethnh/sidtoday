(U//FOUO) The New Meade Operations Center - Organization and Functions

FROM: Al Gray
Deputy Chief, Meade Operations Center
Run Date: 07/13/2003

# (U) The Analysis and Reporting Cell 

(S//SI) The Analysis and Reporting Cell (ARC), a recent partnership between the MOC and Military Integration, provides back-end analytic support to deployed National Intelligence Support Teams (NIST). In this environment, the ARC provides the on-the-job training needed to certify the NIST teams in advance of their deployment. The MOC is teaming with the 704th Army Technical Control and Analysis Element (ATCAE) and the 70th Intelligence Wing, Air Force National Tactical Integration, to bolster the effectiveness of the ARC. In addition, the ARC will support Task Force 20, and the NISTs in Afghanistan and Baghdad with first level metadata analysis in order to focus collection, filter, and nominate voice content for exploitation.

## (S) The HPCP Analysis Cell

(S//SI) Under the direction of SIGINT Strategy and Governance, the MOC on 27 May 2003 stood up the HPCP (High-Powered Cordless Phone) Analysis Cell (HAC) to provide the community a focal point for HPCP issues concerning collection, processing, dataflow, analysis and reporting. The three main thrusts of the HAC are 1) documenting the Tactics Techniques and Procedures for how to prosecute HPCP, using Syria as the test bed; 2) accepting and answering Requests for Information (RFI) from the field; and 3) working dataflow issues with the ATCAE and MENA SIGDEV to get ground sensor collection into the national databases. Also, under the sponsorship of SIGINT Strategy and Governance (SSG) the MOC will host an HPCP Worldwide Conference in the Fall.

## (S) Special Access Cell

(TS//SI) Teaming with Special Source Operations (SSO), the Special Access Cell performs environmental analysis of the global information infrastructure with a focus on international communications to enable future access options. In addition, the MOC will validate and characterize TELEX information from various sources and is responsible for minimizing USSID 18 violations, analyzing the TELEX bearers on a canal-by-canal basis, and ensuring that the dictionary is effectively identifying the TELEX traffic. This activity has opened up new avenues of collection previously unavailable to target offices at NSA.

## (C) The SIGINT Development Division

(TS//SI) The SIGINT Development Division (SDD) is working with Corporate HF Services (CHS), in direct response to a requirement to survey the HF environment in the Konar Valley, Afghanistan where Special Forces units have been compromised. CHS is installing an HF wideband collection system (SUPERCODING) at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan. The MOC will be tasked to conduct search and survey of the HF environment to determine what communications modes are in use.
(TS//SI) The SDD has teamed with the Kunia Regional SIGINT Operations Center (KRSOC) in project Long Stare to identify unidentified signals emanating from North Korea. SDD was also tasked by Cryptologic Exploitation Service (CES) to validate unidentified signals from North Korea from overhead assets.
(S//SI) Additionally, the SDD is
and is conducting HF search and survey looking for United Nations (UN) and NonGovernmental Organizations (NGO) in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and Liberia with a focus toward force protection.
# (U) Collection Development Cell 

(S//SI) A new project for the SDD is to create an increased focus on training with regard to signals development, search, and analysis. In the Collection Development Cell (CDC), the MOC is teaming some of the most experienced collectors with, in some cases, new collection personnel to provide intense on-the-job training on the wide variety of collection equipment and signals processors available in the SDD. This effort complements the ever-increasing role in HF Signals Development, and helps overcome a shortage of highly qualified personnel.

## (C) Tactical Radio Exploitation Cell

(S//SI) The Tactical Radio Exploitation Cell (TREC) is the newest growth area for the MOC. The TREC will incorporate all the accesses available to document the tactical radio environment into a centralized and focused database. This longstanding requirement from SID will finally be realized in the MOC.

## (U) Additional Activities

(S//SI) Expanding on its current role as a test bed for new capabilities, the Director envisions the MOC as a developmental platform for tactics, techniques, procedures, tools, systems, and ideas that can then be exported to the Regional Security Operations Centers or the Mission Ground Stations. This transformation of the MOC's mission will allow it to more effectively support the SCEs' need to transform the skills of their workforce to deal with current and future technologies, by providing a training and operational environment that is suitable for skills development.
(S//SI) Internally, the MOC has reorganized its structure to mirror that of field stations, with an Operations and a Support element. It has moved to a common shift scheduled to promote unit cohesiveness, and has established analysis and training organizations to support its new missions. The MOC is well on its way to establishing itself as a valuable component of the Agency's SIGDEV arsenal.
