(U//FOUO) A SID today Scavenger Hunt is about to begin! For the weeks of September 22-26 and September 29-Oct 3, all SID employees have the opportunity to participate in the first SID today Scavenger Hunt!
(U//FOUO) Here's how it will work:

- Every day (Monday - Friday) there will be a question posted on SID today (type "go sidtoday"). The answers to all of the questions can be found in the archives of past SID today articles. Search through the archives, read the articles, find the answer!
- Keep a log of your answers! Your goal is to find the correct answers to all ten questions. The final question will be posted on Friday, October 3. You will then have until Monday, October 6 at 1200 to compile your answers, double-check them if necessary, and send them off!
- "I've found the answers! Where do I send them?!?!?" Send an email to @nsa. In the email you must include the following information:

Your name
Your sid
Your organization
Your building/room
Your suite number

# And, of course, your answers! 

- Your entry will not be considered if you do not include all of the above information. You do not need to have all ten answers to submit an entry. Only one entry per person will be accepted.
- And the winner is... All entries with highest number of correct answers will receive recognition of participation. All of those winners will be put into a random drawing from which the grand-prize winner will be drawn!
(U//FOUO) If there are any questions, please send an email to @nsa.
(U) Good luck! Happy hunting!
