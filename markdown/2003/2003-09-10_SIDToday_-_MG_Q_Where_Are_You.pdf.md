(U) MG Q, Where Are You?

FROM:

(U//FOUO) If you are wandering through the halls this week, you might notice that something is missing. From September 8-12, you won't be seeing SIGINT Director MG Quirk roaming the halls; instead, he's combing the islands of Hawaii!
(U//FOUO) MG Quirk is attending the annual bilateral conferences with Australia's Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) and New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), which we are hosting at NCPAC in Hawaii this year. These bilateral conferences, part of an annual series of meetings with the Second Parties (UK, CAN, AUS, NZ), provide a venue for senior managers to align collaborative efforts and outline strategic areas of focus within our bilateral relationships.
(U//FOUO) Dan Wolf and senior IAD leadership are with senior SID leadership, representing DIRNSA, at these conferences with our Australian and New Zealand partners. SID and IAD hold separate SIGINT and IA "bilats" with the UK's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and Canada's Communications Security Establishment (CSE), and DIRNSA holds an annual corporate-level conference with these two partners.
