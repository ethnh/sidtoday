(U//FOUO) In just over a year the torch will be lit, and thus will kick off the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, home to the first Olympic Games. Although the first race, dive, and somersault are still a year away, the Intelligence Community is already in full "training mode" for the event. In truth, NSA has been gearing up for the 2004 Olympics for quite some time, in anticipation of playing a larger role than ever before at the international games.

# (U) Prior Games 

(S) The first phase of preparation actually began years ago through the involvement of NSA with the Olympic Games in other cities. NSA has had an active role in the Olympics since the 1984 Los Angeles games, and has seen its involvement increase with the recent games in Atlanta, Sydney, and Salt Lake City. During the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the focus was on counterterrorism, and NSA acted largely in support of the FBI in a fusion cell known as the Olympics Intelligence Center (OIC). The mission of the OIC was to fuse foreign intelligence and law enforcement information to provide threat warning and situation awareness before and during the games. NSA's support to the 2004 Olympics in Athens will be much more complicated.

## (U) The Athens Outlook

(S//SI) Several factors will make the Athens Olympics vastly different, not the least of which is the fact these Olympics will not be held at a domestic location. Also different is that the security organization that NSA will support is the EYP, or Greek National Intelligence Service. NSA will gather information and tip off the EYP of possible terrorist or criminal actions. Without a doubt, the communication between NSA and EYP will take some coordination, and for that reason preparations are already underway.
(S//SI) NSA, and SID in particular, will be sending the largest contingent of personnel in support of the games in our history. A team of 10 NSA analysts will arrive in Greece anywhere from 3045 days before the Olympics and stay until the flame is extinguished to provide the best support possible to the safety and security of the games. It is also important to note that preparations are being made for our in-house support to the games. NSOC again will serve as the single point of contact for the Olympics for our customers. Work is being done across SID to work with customers to receive and understand their specific Information Needs. Data Acquisition, working with SIGINT Development, the Target Offices of Primary Interest, and the extended SIGINT Enterprise, is preparing a comprehensive Olympics Collection Strategy. Moreover, SID is partnering with the Foreign Affairs Directorate to develop a strategy to share threat information with our SIGINT Partners.
(U//FOUO) The Olympic Games are perhaps the greatest platform for global unity, even if it is for just a short time; but they are also an enormous target for would-be evildoers. Thousands will participate and billions will be watching as the games unfold. The scope of the Olympics is tremendous, and so will be the support of SID and NSA. The world will be watching, and so will NSA!
