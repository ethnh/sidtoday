(U//FOUO) SID/FAD Presentation: Enabling Coalition Partners in Afghanistan

FROM: the AF-PAK Mission Management Team
Run Date: 10/19/2009
(TS//SI//REL) As the Obama administration deliberates on a revised strategy and potential troop buildup in Afghanistan, the NSA Enterprise has proactively positioned itself to respond to the expected new information needs -- to include greater reliance on our Second and Third Party SIGINT partners. Mark your calendar for a special presentation on Tuesday, October 20th, 0900-1030, in the Friedman Auditorium.
(TS//SI//REL) The SIGINT and Foreign Affairs Directors will provide an update on the NSA/CSS SIGINT strategy for Afghanistan, with a focus on enabling our coalition partnerships in Afghanistan. The SIGINT Director, Mr. Crumm, and the Director of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Cusick, will address SIGINT enabling of our coalition partners in Afghanistan and the changes in those relationships over the last several years. With more than 40 nations providing troops to the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF) coalition, the SIGINT strategy for Afghanistan has fundamentally transformed our coalition SIGINT partnerships in Afghanistan. Our forwardleaning efforts have taken us from the information-sharing constructs of the past, to an integrated and interdependent SIGINT coalition network supporting national and ISAF operations in Afghanistan. Our way ahead will help our ISAF partners to invest, share, and fully operationalize their SIGINT potential.
(U) Following the presentations, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.
(U//FOUO) All TS//SI-cleared individuals, including our Second Party colleagues, are invited to attend. We expect a full house, so come early for a good seat, as this session will not be broadcast, nor will it be recorded.
