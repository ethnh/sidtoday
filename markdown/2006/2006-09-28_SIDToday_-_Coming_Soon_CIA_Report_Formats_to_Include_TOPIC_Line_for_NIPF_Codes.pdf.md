(U//FOUO) Coming Soon: CIA Report Formats to Include 'TOPIC' Line for NIPF Codes

FROM: Consumer Services (S12C)
Unknown
Run Date: 09/28/2006
(U//FOUO) If you retrieve, or plan to retrieve, CIA reports by National Intelligence Priority Framework (NIPF) code from ANCHORY , please read on!
(U//FOUO) The CIA will be adding a new field to their reports to accommodate the NIPF codes. This new field -- called TOPIC -- will appear between the COUNTRY and SUBJECT lines. Once this field gets established, the NIPF's will be removed from the SUBJECT line -- where they are currently being placed -- and users who want to pull by NIPF will have to modify their ANCHORY profiles to pull them from the TOPIC line. The TOPIC line will be indexed as NIPF rather than TOPI for an ANCHORY search.
(U//FOUO) For those who have been following recent CIA format changes, this supersedes the change described in the SID today article:

- (U//FOUO) Analysts: CIA Reports Are Changing Format; Check Your ANCHORY Retrieval Strategies.
(U//FOUO) This change is not yet in effect. Thus, expect to see another SID today article as soon as we receive word from CIA when the new TOPIC format will be activated.
(U//FOUO) If you have any questions about these changes or need assistance in modifying noninteractive retrievals for ANCHORY, please contact the ANCHORY Help Desk at www.anchory.com or via e-mail at DL_ANCHORY.
