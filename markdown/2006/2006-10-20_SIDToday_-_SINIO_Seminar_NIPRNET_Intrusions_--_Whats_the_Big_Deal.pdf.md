(U//FOUO) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present the 19th in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for 2006. "NIPRNET Intrusions - What's the Big deal? Survey of Intrusion Techniques, Detection, and Attribution " will be presented by Mr. John Coale, SINIO and $\square$ Deputy SINIO for Information Operations.

# Course Overview: 

(S//REL) Intrusion detection and response technologies are relatively immature, but they have grown in importance in the network security marketplace in the past few years. The widespread use of distributed networking -- exemplified by the Internet -- and the consequent growth of worldwide electronic commerce has substantially increased the importance of network security in the minds of the information technology professionals, system and network managers, and their customers.
(S//REL) These facts, coupled with the increase in publicity of electronic attacks on networks and the realization that a serious threat is posed to the computer-based critical infrastructure components by exploitative intrusions, have caused a flurry of activity by intrusion-detection vendors as well as a substantial increase in research. This seminar will introduce the attendee to the methodology of the hacker, examine the paradigm of attribution-versus-detection and provide an overview of NSA monitoring of NIPRNet intrusions.
(U//FOUO) To register, and for further info on this series of seminars, please consult the SINIO Brown Bag Seminars Website. Any questions or concerns regarding registration should be directed to the NCS.
