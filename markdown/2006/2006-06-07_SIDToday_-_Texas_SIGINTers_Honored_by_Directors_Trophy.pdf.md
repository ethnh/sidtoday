(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS Texas is pleased to acknowledge the efforts of its Navy Information Operations Command Texas (NIOC Texas), which was recently awarded the 2005 Director's Trophy (see the announcement). NIOC Texas provides data to commanders worldwide in support of the Global War on Terrorism* and drug interdiction operations.
(U//FOUO) NIOC Texas provided consistently superior Information Warfare Support aboard airborne, surface, subsurface platforms and ground units while operating daily in support of USSOUTHCOM, USEUCOM, USNORTHCOM and JIATF-South joint and maritime tasking. NIOC Texas established the Texas Fleet Information Operations Center and initiated six new mission areas supporting commanders in three maritime regions.
(U//FOUO) Flight personnel flew over 70 missions and amassed 620 flight hours onboard reconnaissance aircraft, while others deployed 8,646 man-days on 26 surface and subsurface units. Total days deployed for sailors throughout the world totaled 11,582 - a 220\% increase from 2004. Ashore and afloat operations resulted in the seizure of 213+ metric tons of contraband valued over $\$ 5$ billion and 721 arrests, the largest annual seizure in history.
(U//FOUO) The NIOC Texas Commanding Officer, CDR James Stevenson, related the following sentiment concerning the award, "Being awarded the Director's Trophy is a true testament to numerous sailors who have contributed to the establishment of NSA/CSS Texas and the Fleet Information Operations Center. I could not be more proud of their superlative efforts." NSA/CSS Texas echoes CDR Stevenson's remarks in acknowledging a job well done!

(S//SI) NIOC Texas targets the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a tier 1 terrorist group.
