SIGINT professionals,
(U) This week, all NSA employees, civilian and military, have the distinct honor of being a part of the 57th Armed Forces Week festivities. Professional, social and formal events highlight this week's schedule of events that culminate in Friday evening's Armed Forces Week Ball. Just as in years past, I expect a great turnout for this time-honored once-a-year celebration.
(U) Don't let the title of "Armed Forces Week" mislead anyone. The entire NSA workforce is most welcome at each and every activity! Most of us have one -- if not many -- soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard men and women in our workspace. I can say from my own experience that they would find it professionally fulfilling to see your support by your participation in these activities. Therefore, I request maximum feasible involvement this week.
(U) I have expressed to Directorate leaders that participation is an opportunity that allows the entire SID workforce a chance to say "Thanks," not only to Armed Forces in distant lands, but also to the military personnel who sit right next to them on a daily basis!
(U) I wholeheartedly anticipate that everyone will greatly benefit by attending Armed Forces Week events that the Director has scheduled, as we reflect on past sacrifices and celebrate memorable accomplishments and the treasured values that we all enjoy as United States citizens.
(U) Thank you for your service, dedication and professionalism. Please take advantage of this week's events as we celebrate our Armed Forces!

Richard J. Quirk, III
Major General, U.S. Army
Signals Intelligence Director
