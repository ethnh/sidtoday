(U//FOUO) It's been a little over a year since the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) stood up (see SID today article ), to serve as the US Government's focal point for "orchestrating and shaping the national and international effort to eliminate the terrorist threat to US interests at home and abroad." What is the NCTC's status today?
(U//FOUO) The NCTC - located in the excellent Liberty Crossing facility in McLean, Virginia --has established itself as the primary provider of CT information to the national leadership. The Center contributes information to the President's Daily Brief and a number of other high-level reports, bulletins, alerts and advisories. NCTC representatives also brief the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence (PDDNI) on terrorism issues.
(U//FOUO) NCTC's Directorate of Intelligence is fast becoming the Intelligence Community's new center for terrorism analysis, with lots of resources flowing to the Center. It has become a collaborative hub, with a highly motivated and diverse work force drawn from over 17 federal agencies. Employees of the NCTC gain invaluable knowledge from these peer-to-peer interactions.
(U//FOUO) NSAers at the NCTC have access to all of the US Government's information on terrorism, including other agencies' operational traffic usually not seen by NSA analysts. Excellent training opportunities have also been put in place for the NCTC work force, in recognition that counterterrorism may be a national priority for a long time to come.
(U//FOUO) Considering a job in counterterrorism? Several job vacancies at the NCTC are currently open in the Field Vacancy Announcements. Look for them under the location McLean, $V A$.
