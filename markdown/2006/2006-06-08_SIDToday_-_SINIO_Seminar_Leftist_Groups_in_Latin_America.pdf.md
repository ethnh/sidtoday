# Course Overview: 

(U//FOUO) The victory by populist leader Evo Morales in Bolivia has given other leftists groups throughout Latin America hope that they too can rise up and play an influential role in their country's politics. The victory by Morales has also given Hugo Chavez's Bolivarian Revolution a new ally to further spread the word. But who is listening? Are these small "Bolivarian Circles" of today producing the Evo Moraleses of tomorrow? Who else is out there ready to capitalize on the anti-U.S. sentiment and tip the ideological balance more to the left?
