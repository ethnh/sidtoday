(S//REL) Korean Terrestrial RF Collection Update

Radio Exploitation/ Project Management (S33112)
Run Date: $11 / 30 / 2006$
(S//REL) An interim antenna array is set up at Camp Humphreys; part of larger plan to improve RF (radio frequency) access at locations around South Korea.
(S//REL) Radio Exploitation (S3311) this year completed the first stage of the terrestrial RF collection modernization effort on the Korean peninsula. This first stage involved the installation of an interim antenna array at Field Station Korea (FSK), located at Camp Humphreys, 40 miles south of Seoul near P'yong'taek.

# (U) Background 

(S//REL) The relocation of US Forces Korea (USFK) headquarters and other facilities from Yongsan Garrison in Seoul to Camp Humphreys prompted S3311 to examine the way terrestrial RF is being performed on the Korean peninsula. The Commander, USFK, GEN LaPorte, selected the current Field Station Korea antenna field as the site for the new Combined Forces Command (CFC) Headquarters complex. This necessitated the construction of an interim antenna array to function until a more permanent replacement can be established.

## (S//REL) Interim Antenna Array Installed

(S//SI//REL) A team representing Antenna and Spectrum Engineering (ASE) and the Pacific Technical Center (PTC), supported by members of Special US Liaison Advisor, Korea (SUSLAK), installed a new eight-element turnstile array, as well as moving two 16-element Hermes Loop antennas to the field just north of the building S-1218 on the Field Station. These antennas provide collection and direction-finding capability against North Korea as well as providing coverage of the entire western Pacific area.
(S//REL) In addition, the team installed an AVW2 antenna to improve collection of very low frequency (VLF) transmissions. This antenna replaced the Beverage long wire antenna. After testing, certification and migration of existing collection systems to the new antennas, the team de-installed the old DRAGONWATCH and PUSHER antennas. The team completed the effort on the 14th of July 2006. This interim antenna array installation allows for construction to begin on the new CFC Headquarters building.

## (U) Next Steps

(S//REL) This step is part of S3311's overall framework for long-term improvement and upgrade of the RF access points around South Korea. This fall, the team returned to South Korea to refurbish the existing PUSHER array located at the South Korean Defense Security Agency (DSA) site K50 near Daegu (aka Taegu, located in south-central South Korea). This work sets the stage for the migration of collection systems from FSK and Osan Air Base, as well as lays the foundation for the installation of new GLAIVE* HF collection systems in country.
