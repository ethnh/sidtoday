(U) In recent years, SID today has marked Labor Day by asking the readership to tell us about the unusual jobs they held before coming to work at NSA (see below for links to those articles). This year we are trying something a little different: Who is the most famous person you ever met in the course of working for NSA?
(U) For example, were you once tapped on the shoulder and told to rush to Washington to talk to the Vice President? Or were you working at an overseas site when a foreign dignitary came to visit? Perhaps you once briefed a celebrity who visited NSA?
(U//FOUO) Please write a paragraph or so describing the circumstances surrounding your "brush with fame" and email it to If we get some good anecdotes, we'll post them on SID today. We look forward to your submission!
(U) In past years, we've posted the following articles to honor Labor Day:

- (U) "Odd Jobs" Before NSA (part 1)
- (U) "Odd Jobs" Before NSA (part 2)
- (U) Misspent Youth? -- Jobs NSAers Held in a "Former Life"
(U) French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy is pictured through viewfinder during news conference (Reuters)
