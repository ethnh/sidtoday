## (S//SI) GEO Build-Out

(S) Another installment of the series on the Analysis \& Production build-out. This week we'll look at the Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO) mission:
(S//SI) The GEO FY 2007-2011 build-out plan is focused on building up analytic and production capabilities at the Cryptologic Centers and on maturing the existing relationships with the European Command and Central Command. Here's what each of the GEO Production Centers is doing:

## NSA/CSS Washington (NSAW) :

(S//SI) The GEO Primary Production Center Manager (PPCM) is Rob Schrier. The NSAW Production Center provides analytic products and services primarily in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Unique to the NSAW GEO Production Center are several functions:

- a $24 \times 7$ near real-time geospatial metadata support to current military operations;
- VOICESAIL mission management;
- a SIGINT Development element focused on the development of capabilities specific to geolocation that includes a Geospatial Metadata Analytic Tools and Techniques Development area; and
- a staff that focuses on developing corporate (GEO) policy and working with ADET* on the development of Global Metadata Analysis (GMA) training.
(S//SI) It is important to note that the GEO NSAW Production Center includes embedded integrees from DIA JITF-CT*, USM-1* and CIA as well as NGA* Second party Imagery and Geospatial analysts and Second party SIGINT integrees from the UK and Canada. Also unique to GEO NSAW is the Geospatial Target Analysis Center, a multi-agency center responsible for producing foreign intelligence reports based on the target's exchange of infrastructure, architectural and engineering projects using Geographic Information System (GIS), Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing software packages.


## NSA/CSS Georgia :

(S//SI) The GEO Georgia Production Center Manager is This GEO Production Center is currently focused on providing Global Metadata Analysis support to enhance reporting on Iraqi targets (CT* and MENA*) currently exploited at NSA/CSS Georgia. By the end of FY06, GEO Georgia should have approximately 10 Global Metadata Analysts (GMA). The Build-out plan for GEO Georgia is to continue to expand GMA support through FY 2011 with the goal of reaching an

estimated end strength of 65 (combined military and civilian population.) Geo Georgia can be reached at DL GRSOC GEORGIA.

# NSA/CSS Hawaii : 

(S//SI) The GEO Production Manager in Hawaii, $\square$ is focusing the GEO workforce in Hawaii on supporting and geospatially enabling the CT targets in the Pacific region. Specifically, at this time they are focused on geospatially enabling the Philippine CT target where GMAs are embedded. By the end of FY06, we believe that the GEO Hawaii workforce will total 7 employees. The build-out plan for GEO Hawaii is to continue to expand GMA to other targets, with the current goal for the estimated end strength growth of the GEO element resulting set at approximately 30 total (a combination of civilian and military employees.)

## NSA/CSS Texas :

(S//SI) The plans for Texas are to hire a GEO Production Center Manager (PCM) and two GMAs to jumpstart the GEO mission in Texas during FY06, beginning with geospatially enabling CT targets. The longer-term build-out plan for GEO Texas will expand GMA to other target areas to include Crime and Narcotics and Combating Proliferation; current end strength estimates for GEO Texas range between 25-30.

Central Command (CENTCOM) :
(S//SI) GEO PCM Eric Fuller is focused on coordinating tactical GMA support to the elements deployed in the CENTCOM Theater of Operations under the auspices of NCR CENTCOM. In addition to performing GMA in Tampa at CENTCOM Main, the CENTCOM PCM oversees the GMA support provided on the ground by deployed tactical SIGINT elements. CSG CENTCOM currently has 15 analysts providing GMA support in Tampa with a projected 18 by the 4th quarter of 2006.

European Command (EUCOM) :
(S//SI) GEO PCM is focused on coordinating the GMA EUCOM target support and for keeping the GEO enterprise apprised of ongoing operations undertaken in that theater. Currently, the GEO EUCOM PCM working under the auspices of NCR EUCOM is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the analytic services and products produced by GMA elements located in Stuttgart, at the ESC (European Security Center) in Darmstadt and at the Joint Analysis Center in Molesworth.
(U//FOUO) These are only the highlights. GEO has a number of other collaborative GMA efforts underway -- too many to effectively describe here.
