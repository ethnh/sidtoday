(U) Talks center on Russian military issues.
(S//SI//REL) The Annual Planning Conference (APC) for Finland took place 2-4 October and was considered an overall success from both sides. A large part of the conference was used for analytic exchange between FIRE (the Finnish Intelligence Research Establishment) and NSA analysts. All action items from last year's APC were closed out to everyone's satisfaction.
(S//SI//REL) APC topics covered a wide range of Russian military issues, including new Russian radar, navigation and C3I* Air Defense systems. The Finns updated us on their collection of communications from sites using the new UNIVERSAL Air Defense system. In turn, NSA answered questions posed by FIRE regarding Russian military communications equipment, including modems and crypto devices in use today. This candid discussion was greatly appreciated and very useful to the FIRE representatives.
(S//SI//REL) The Finns were also briefed about ADET (NSA's Associate Directorate for Education and Training). They were very impressed by the facility and are particularly interested in taking Signals Analysis training.
(S//SI//REL) NSA's Russia Military (S2H4) analysts provided excellent briefings on several topics, including analysis of Short Duration Signals (SDS). The SDS used by Russian Strategic Bombers and Naval Vessels proved to be an eye-opener for FIRE analysts; it was apparent that FIRE analysts have much to learn on this topic and will benefit greatly from our experience in this field.
(S//SI//REL) FIRE briefed their crypto-analytic effort on the Russian NSA refers to as NSA's Technical Analysis Branch (S2H46) will be providing FIRE with and training to bring them up to speed on this important aspect of Russian communications.
(S//SI//REL) In the end, FIRE's Colonel Juha Wihersaari stated that they were "happy" with the conference, which made the NSA participants' day!
