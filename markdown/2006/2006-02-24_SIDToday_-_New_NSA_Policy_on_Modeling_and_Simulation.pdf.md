(U//FOUO) New NSA Policy on Modeling and Simulation
FROM: Dr. $\square$ Operations Research, Modeling and Simulation (S01M) and $\square$ SIGINT Policy (S02L1)
Run Date: $02 / 24 / 2006$
(U//FOUO) Is your office involved in Modeling and Simulation activities? Do you develop or use computer-based models? If so, a new policy applies to you. On 6 February 2006, DIRNSA signed NSA/CSS Policy 2-15, "NSA/CSS Modeling and Simulation Verification, Validation and Accreditation."
(U//FOUO) This policy applies to all NSA/CSS components involved in Modeling and Simulation (M\&S), and assigns responsibility for overseeing NSA's M\&S activities to the Chief of SID's Office of Operations Research, Modeling and Simulation (S01M). It also assigns specific responsibilities to the following officials:

- the NSA/CSS Chief Systems Engineer;
- NSA/CSS Mission Directors, Associate Directors, and Principal Directors;
- the NSA/CSS Chief of Staff;
- Service Cryptologic Element (SCE) Commanders; and,
- the NSA/CSS Program Working Group (PWG).

Policy 2-15
(U//FOUO) Modeling and Simulation plays an important role for SID and NSA/CSS. Below are a few examples of computer-based models S01M has developed for SID in FY05:
- (C) An End-to-End Model representing the future SIGINT mission flow and system design was developed for the SID System Engineering Office (SSEO). Our simulation answers questions about specific Key Performance Parameters (KPP) using the Layered Zone Model (LZM) as a template. We provided SID with the ability to simulate modifications to the SIGINT mission by identifying the architectural trade-offs and impacts to the major Program Executive Office (PEO) programs and ITD infrastructure;
- (S) A Language Capabilities and Readiness Model (LCRM) for the NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority (SLA) that examines the dynamics between linguist skill development and mission readiness and provides quantitative analysis for workforce planning in the areas of linguist requirements, training, and hiring;
- (TS//SI) A Network Reconstruction Model for the Geospatial Exploitation Office (S2L) that developed techniques to improve the speed and accuracy of Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) subscriber geolocation using cellular phone data collected with the PILOTHOUSE system; and,
- (C) ACRES is a model that replicates the functions of the SIGINT process. It is the primary training tool used by the Combatant Commander's staffs to learn about the techniques of leveraging SIGINT against viable targets.
