FROM: Operation SIGINT
Run Date: 03/16/2006

Date: 20 March 2006 (Monday)
Time: 1100 to 1200
Room: OPS2B 4118-6
Registration instructions follow. Here's a description of the session:
(S//SI) One of the highest priority concerns facing the United States and its allies today is the threat of terrorists acquiring and using chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) weapons, either at home or abroad.
(S//SI) SIGINT needs to provide the earliest possible actionable warning information to enable the US and allied governments to deny terrorists the capability to acquire, or opportunities to use, CBRN weapons. In order for SIGINT to be successful in this mission, everyone in the SIGINT production chain needs to be aware of how their target information could potentially contribute to this critical mission.
(S//SI) This seminar offering will provide participants with a basic understanding of what CBRN is, the threat and challenges we face, and what their potential role is in helping SIGINT respond to this threat.
