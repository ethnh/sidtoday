(S//SI) NSA/CSS Texas Supplies Key Reporting About Cuba for Congressional Mandated Memo

FROM:
NSA-Texas, Cuban Economics (TS2A1)
Run Date: 08/30/2006
(U//FOUO) Here's the latest quarterly update from NSA/CSS Texas...
(S//SI) NSA/CSS Texas recently established a Cuban Economics Mission from the ground up through Digital Network Exploitation. While developing this mission, it became clear that the Cubans and Russians were still collaborating on a wide variety of issues, including Cuban military preparations to purchase two additional Che-22 amphibious aircraft (pictured) from Russia.
(S//SI) The hydroplanes were specifically configured for photoreconnaissance duties and are scheduled for a September delivery. Upon delivery, the Cuban Interior Ministry will have four of these aircraft that will most likely be used to interdict drug shipments and/or people-smuggling operations while patrolling Cuba's territorial waters.
(S//SI) Laudatory feedback from CIA was swift:
" Each year the Intelligence Community is responsible for compiling the Helms-Burton Congressional mandated memo on Cuban arms purchases and sales. A quick survey of the sources for this annual requirement is revealing. NSA/CSS Texas reports traditionally constitute the overwhelming majority of the reports used to compile the memo; more recently NSA/CSS Texas reports were the only contributors in the latest memo from last year. It comes as no surprise NSA/CSS Texas continues to dominate in this subject. Reports like this one are integral to this requirement and are sure to be included in this year's iteration. "
(S//SI) Through the exploitation of Cuban air defense tracking by the Cuban military mission at NSA/CSS Texas, it appears that the first two Che-22 aircraft have already begun surveillance duties in the extreme northwest and southwest portions of the Pinar del Rio province in western Cuba.
