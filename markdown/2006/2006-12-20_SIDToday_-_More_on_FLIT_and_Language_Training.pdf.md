# (U//FOUO) More on FLIT and Language Training 

FROM: Cheryl Houser
NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority
Run Date: 12/20/2006
(U//FOUO) Many thanks to 000000000000 for highlighting some of the language training opportunities available through the Senior Language Authority's Office and the Center for Language. If you haven't seen his article on SID today, please check it out here.
(U//FOUO) We do want to augment the information about Foreign Language Immersion Training (FLIT). These mini-, iso-, and long-term immersion programs occur both CONUS and OCONUS* and can last anywhere from one week to a full year. The goal is always to provide the most relevant training at the most approprate location and in the most suitable time frame to assist each language analyst in achieving the highest possible levels of foreign language proficiency. For more information, visit the FLIT website .
(U//FOUO) Please feel free to contact any of us in the Office of the NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority, the Language Analysis Skill Community, or the Center for Language (E3) (see the contact list ) for any questions you may have about language training programs and initiatives.
*(U) Notes:
CONUS = Continental U.S.
OCONUS = Outside the Continental U.S.
