FROM: SIDtoday

Run Date: 11/30/2006
(U) Analysts and managers: Does one of your customers have a good story to tell about how they used SIGINT to great effect in their work? SID today would like to publish a few articles written from the perspective of a SIGINT customer, showing how they actually use the SIGINT they receive and citing a good "case study."
(U) If you know of a customer who would be willing to draft such an article, please tell us your idea. (For instructions, see the link to "submission guidelines" that can be found at the bottom of this webpage.) We're looking forward to hearing from you!
