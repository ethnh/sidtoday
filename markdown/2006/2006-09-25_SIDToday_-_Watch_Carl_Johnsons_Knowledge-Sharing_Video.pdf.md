# (U) The Video 

(U//FOUO) In a 10-minute video-capture, Carl Johnson, Deputy Director for Analysis and Production, gives a strong endorsement for knowledge capture and knowledge sharing to his workforce, empowering and encouraging them to share their knowledge. Tacit knowledge is that which builds intuition and decision-making and as Carl Johnson puts it, "that which is between your ears and how you know what you know."
(U//FOUO) Carl Johnson shares his own list of unforgettable mentors from his past here at NSA and the lessons that have stayed with him throughout his career. He gives clear direction, strong advocacy and incentives for the workforce to share knowledge in a format that is globally shareable, visible, and reusable. He urges the workforce to contribute, populate and use wikis as a venue. Check out his video at this link:

## (U) Wikis

(U//FOUO) Think about this the next time there are 30 emails or so exchanged within a small distribution, but that are chock full of information-sharing, collaboration, discussion, or even debate. Usually, they are rich in knowledge content; the stuff you just don't get from a database or an analyst's report or a manual or a standard-operating-procedure document.
(U//FOUO) Consider using wikis as the venue for collaboration and sharing and building it as a critical knowledge repository, vital to get good work done. Knowledge-sharing in wikis need not be impeded by policy constraints and the content is almost immediately vetted by the "self policing" acts of the community of interest. The ethics of the community will not tolerate misinformation and will work to immediately correct it. In addition, email alerts from wikis can tell the user personally, when his or her topic of interest has just had a new nugget of knowledge added to it.
(U//FOUO) Take to heart Carl Johnson's message and help build NSA's knowledge repository. For more information on wikis at NSA, contact www.sina.com (www.sina.com).
