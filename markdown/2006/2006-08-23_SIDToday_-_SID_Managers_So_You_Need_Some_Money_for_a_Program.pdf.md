(U) SID Managers: So You Need Some Money for a Program?

(U//FOUO) As the new fiscal year approaches, many programs face shortfalls either closing out the fiscal year or entering the new one. Other needs arise independent of the calendar. SIGINT Planning and the forward-deployed Finance staff want you to know that there is a mature process in place for vetting and approving unfunded requests and for identifying the sources of funding to pay for them.
(U//FOUO) First, you should know that we are not authorized to carry an ongoing "reserve," or special pot of money, to fund our shortfalls throughout the year. That means that either ongoing activities must be reduced if SID accepts a request for funding, or the request must be forwarded to the NSA corporation -- but SID has had limited success with this latter approach. Second, MG Quirk has delegated all fiduciary responsibility and resources to the deputy directorates. Therefore, on behalf of MG Quirk, SIGINT Planning and the Finance staff conduct the unfunded request (UFR) process for the benefit of the deputy directorates.
(U) Here is how it works:
(U//FOUO) Anyone can identify a shortfall, but only designated representatives from S0, S1, S2, S3, FAD, or NTOC are able to validate the shortfall and submit it for inclusion on the UFR list. The reps for S0, S1-plus-CT, S2, S3, FAD, and NTOC are, currently, respectively.
(U//FOUO) These individuals have a template they must fill out that captures essential information about the shortfall for decision makers, such as the usual identifying information as well as what the money is for and what difference it will make to performance of the program or of the USSS. The project name is needed, as well as cost center information, type of appropriation needed, amounts, and the status of the request.
(U//FOUO) The designated POC submits the UFR for the shortfall list once this information is complete. The SIGINT Planning and the Finance staffs jointly maintain the list. Frequently, the validating organization is able to "churn" for its request, and so that shortfall is marked as withdrawn. However, if the deputy directorate to which the shortfall is submitted determines that the shortfall is not valid (for any reason), then the item is not eligible for the UFR list.
(U//FOUO) At various times during the fiscal year, and more often at times of special need or interest, the above individuals get together under the auspices of SIGINT Planning and the forward-deployed Finance organization to "scrub" the list again -- getting additional and updated data as needed. Then, they prioritize the list based on urgency and merit.
(U//FOUO) Once the total bill is identified, they have a set of business rules to identify the potential sources of funds within SID for the set of items to be funded on the UFR list. If the sources are deemed to be more valuable than any UFR items, then those items ultimately are not funded. Because sources usually entail a direct and certain cut to level of effort in ongoing programs, there is an incentive to address UFRs no earlier than when the need is pressing.
(U//FOUO) Soon thereafter, the list of prioritized UFRs and the sources to pay for them are forwarded to the Program and Budget Advisory Committee (PBAC), which consists of the Deputy Directors (DDs), Assistant DDs, SID Chief of Staff, SID Technical Director, and other key policy makers; it is chaired by the Director of the US SIGINT System (USSS) -- aka the SIGINT Director -- once each month. The PBAC makes resource decisions on behalf of the full USSS. The PBAC can send UFRs back for further work, reject them, or direct that the shortfalls be paid.
(U//FOUO) If a particular shortfall needs to be addressed out of cycle, then the Director of the
USSS may use other sessions with his leadership team to make urgent decisions. Immediately after decisions are made the forward deployed Finance staff develops change sheets for entry into the SEACPS financial system.
(U//FOUO) So, if you wonder why someone you have never heard of is asking you details about your request for additional funds, or if you were wondering how to go about getting such funds, now you know!
(U//FOUO) If you have any questions on the UFR process, please contact David Zlowe (s), or (s), or (s).
