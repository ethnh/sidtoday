(C) In a Nutshell: Defense Watch Conditions (WATCHCONs)

FROM:
Deputy SINIO for Warning (S17)

# - (C) WATCHCONS: What Are They? 

(C) Watch Conditions (WATCHCON) are a key feature of the Defense Indications \& Warning System (DIWS), whose goal is to provide senior civilian and military decision-makers the earliest possible "strategic warning" of foreign geopolitical/military developments which might adversely impact U.S. or Allied interests, and which therefore may require policy decisions or actions. DIWS operates under the auspices of the Director, DIA, and Principal Members include DIA, the Unified Commands and USFK; NSA is a very active Associate Member.

## - (C) How Do WATCHCONS Work?

(S) A DIWS member first establishes and defines a specific geopolitical/military Warning Problem to highlight a developing Force-on-Force or Low Intensity Conflict issue. Participating members then monitor this pre-defined Problem and periodically issue warning reports to policymakers in the form of Defense WATCHCON Change Reports. These reports employ a series of five WATCHCON levels (see box) to express a participating organization's "degree of concern," as well as an assessment of the situation and perhaps a statement of the warning time available.

## (C) WATCHCON Levels and Definitions

## WATCHCON I (IMMINENT CRISIS/ CRISIS)

- There is an imminent crisis or an actual crisis.
- There is a clear and immediate threat.
- There may be no additional warning time.
- The maximum available intelligence resources should be allocated to manage this Warning Problem.


## WATCHCON II (PROBABLE CRISIS)

- There is a significant threat leading to a probable crisis.
- Warning time may be limited.
- Resource managers should consider allocating additional intelligence resources to this Warning Problem.


## WATCHCON III (POTENTIAL CRISIS)

- There is an increased threat and a potential crisis.
- Warning time may start to become a
constraining factor.

# WATCHCON IV (ENVIRONMENT FOR CRISIS) 

- There is an environment for the development of a crisis.
- There is an identifiable potential threat in its early development or latent phase.


## WATCHCON V (NO ACTIVE PROBLEM/NORMAL POSTURE)

- There is no active Warning Problem for the country or region.
- The country or region is being monitored on a normal peacetime basis.
(S) Note that the definitions and scope of these Warning Problems vary considerably and are not influenced by how important any given regional/ topical target may be in the broader spectrum of U.S. political/military interests. The Russia/Georgia Warning Problem, for example, addresses only "Russian military action in Georgia," while the Egypt Internal Warning Problem is focused on "political instability and civil unrest;" neither Warning Problem attempts to delve into broader issues regarding these targets which may also be of interest to our intelligence consumers. Note, too, that while there is no direct connection between a change in WATCHCON level and the allocation of collection or analytic resources, WATCHCON levels I and II should prompt resource managers to consider whether their organization's current level of effort is still appropriate.


## - (C) The Timing of WATCHCON Reports

(C) There are two main factors which influence the timing of WATCHCON Change Reports: geopolitical/military circumstances which raise or lower a DIWS member's "degree of concern," thereby warranting an adjustment of the WATCHCON level, or the need to replace outdated WATCHCON assessments.

## - (U) What's Your Role?

(C) NSA's active participation in DIWS is spearheaded by the SIGINT National Intelligence Officer (SINIO) for Warning, who researches, drafts, coordinates and releases all NSA/CSS WATCHCON Change Reports. SINIO/Warning routinely engages relevant SINIO and TOPI (Target Office of Primary Interest) elements in this process. They play a key role by providing the necessary depth of expertise, and ultimately are responsible for determining/approving the proposed WATCHCON level and assessment. Also, they may initiate the production of a WATCHCON Change Report, based on their understanding of new developments.
