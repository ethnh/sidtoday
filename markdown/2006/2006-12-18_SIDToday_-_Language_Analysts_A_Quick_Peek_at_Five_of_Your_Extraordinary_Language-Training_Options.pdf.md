(U//FOUO) Language Analysts: A Quick Peek at Five of Your Extraordinary Language-Training Options

(U//FOUO) Given the substantial increase in Foreign Language Incentive Pay (FLIP) for FY07, Language Analysts are more motivated than ever to test at Level 3 in both the Voice and Graphic modes. In addition, many of the Language Analysts who have already tested at Level 3 in either or both modes are anxious to further their linguistic and cultural knowledge. Luckily, some exciting training possibilities are on offer to help them meet those goals.
(U//FOUO) Language Analysts at NSA currently benefit from more language training options than ever before, and these options are available to all - they are not restricted on a seniority basis. Like their more experienced colleagues, new Language Development Program (LDP) members are currently receiving language training through many different venues, including:

1. The National Cryptologic School's Center for Language (E3),
2. NCS Adjunct Faculty-led Directed Studies courses,
3. In-language Intelligence Community Area Studies (ICAS) courses,
4. Local Vendor Training (ELTP), and
5. Foreign Language Immersion Training (FLIT).
(C) Let's skip down to the 3rd bullet: Did you know that you can suggest specific courses - and even specific instructors - for the ICAS program? For example, last summer an instructor from Brigham Young University was brought in to teach a highly effective phonetics course at L-3 Communications (located at the National Business Park). This idea became a reality because a Language Analyst decided to contact the L-3 Communications, who then organized the seminar (thereby protecting the confidentiality of the NSA Language Analysts attending the course).
(C) Now let's take a gander at bullets 4 and 5: If you are unable to get the training you need through NCS and ICAS, you may wish to consider the ELTP and FLIT programs. With the ELTP, you and up to 3 additional students can study with a native-level tutor at 1 of 6 locations near NSAW. With the FLIT program, you can travel overseas to undergo an intensive and exciting language immersion for 2-5 weeks. (Both of these programs require approval from your supervisor and the Language Training Investment Board.)
(U//FOUO) There are many other linguistic resources available to NSA's Language Analysts (LANGNET, LARC \& SCHOOLBAG, LAPHP books and conferences, CASL, LLC, GLC, etc.). Please take a moment to research them online at the NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority website ("Go Language") - you'll be glad you did!
