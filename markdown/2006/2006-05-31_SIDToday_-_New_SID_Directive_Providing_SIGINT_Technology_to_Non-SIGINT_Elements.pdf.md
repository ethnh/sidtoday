(S//REL) New SID Directive: Providing SIGINT Technology to NonSIGINT Elements

FROM:
SIGINT Policy (S02L1)
Run Date: 05/31/2006
(S//REL) United States SIGINT System elements and Electronic Warfare* elements both need to locate targets. Have you ever wondered what the process is for passing SIGINT technology to EW and other non-SIGINT elements to help them do so?
(S//REL) SID Management Directive 418 , " The Use of SIGINT Technology to Locate Targets Under Other Than Intelligence/SIGINT Authorities ," was signed by the SIGINT Director on 19 May 2006. Along with providing direction on the provision of SIGINT technology to non-SIGINT elements for locating targets, Directive 418 also defines the minimum essential coordination and deconfliction required between the USSS and non-SIGINT units when using such technology operationally and in exercises. It lists responsibilities for various Agency personnel, including NSA/CSS Representatives, the SID Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3), and SID's Deputy Director for Customer Relationships (S1).
(S//REL) The provision of appropriate SIGINT-developed locational technology to operational forces is in the best interests of not only NSA but also the Department of Defense, the Intelligence Community, and overall U.S. national security.

*(U) Notes:
(U) Electronic Warfare Operations are defined as any military action involving the use of electromagnetic energy and directed energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum or attack the adversary. (For further details, see Directive 418.)
