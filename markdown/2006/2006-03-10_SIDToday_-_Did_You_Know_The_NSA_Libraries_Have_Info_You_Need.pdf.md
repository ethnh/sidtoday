(U//FOUO) The NSA/CSS Libraries, a part of Advanced Intelligence Research Services (AIRS), are a great adjunct to the reporting and analysis needs of the NSA population. Our Electronic Library is your gateway to the holdings of the Libraries. You can request books, renew library materials, and make suggestions online for book and periodical purchases.
(U//FOUO) A library staff member can provide you with your initial Library PIN number, which is required for some applications. You can then view your account and change your PIN to better suit your needs. The online catalog is available both in the libraries and at your desktop. Just "go stilas" to do an online search of our holdings, or visit us at our webpage to see all the resources we have to offer.
(U//FOUO) With the current emphasis on online information, people often believe that all the information they need is available online; however, there is a wealth of knowledge that is not, and never will be, available in electronic format. The Main Library (OPS1), the Geographic Resource Center (OPS1), and the R\&E Library (R\&E) have many hardcopy resources including thousands of books and technical journals on subjects including cryptography, languages, engineering, geography, mathematics, physics, politics, telecommunications, and computers. Come check us out!
