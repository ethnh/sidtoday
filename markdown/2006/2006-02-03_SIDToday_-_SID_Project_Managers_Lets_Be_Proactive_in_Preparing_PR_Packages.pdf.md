(U//FOUO) SID Project Managers: Let's Be Proactive in Preparing PR Packages

FROM: Lonny Anderson
SID Associate Deputy Director for the Global War on Terrorism
Run Date: 02/03/2006
(U//FOUO) In recent meetings with Senior Staffers from both the DNI's office and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to discuss the NSA FY06 Supplemental Requests, it was repeatedly stressed that -- whether real or perceived -- NSA has poor outlay rates, both for its PFR (Program For the Record) and Supplemental dollars, compared to the rest of the Intelligence Community. There are many possible reasons for this, however none negates the fact that something must be done to rectify this problem.
(U//FOUO) As indicated by , NSA Comptroller, at her forum on Monday, proper planning will be an integral part of improving our outlay rates for FY06. As a result, I would like to ask all SID Project Managers to be especially proactive in working with their forward-deployed Directorate of Finance (DF) and Senior Acquisition Executive (DA) representatives to have Purchase Request (PR) packages prepared and in the queue for the first release of the FY06 Supplemental. I've met with both organizations and they stand prepared to do whatever it takes to work with us to successfully accomplish this challenging task.
(U//FOUO) I know the entire FY06 Supplemental Request has not yet been finalized, but the first release of both the Counterterrorism and IRAQ Supplementals has been appropriated and that information has been disseminated to your DFS forward-deployed representatives. DA and DF understand their role in this request and they are well aware that adjustments will have to be made to final documentations and PRs. Most importantly, however, they understand the significant contribution they will make in working with appropriate SID mission elements to have PRs ready to award as soon as the FY06 Supplemental request officially arrives in the building.
(U//FOUO) Fighting the Global War on Terror is a long-term issue, with challenging problems, hard questions and no easy resolutions. We must be flexible in our efforts to accomplish the tasks levied upon us and we must work as a cohesive group to successfully manage our requirements. The more we prepare in advance, the more prepared we will be in the future. I urge each of you to take the necessary steps to ensure we stand as prepared as we can be to continue supporting the Global War on Terror.
