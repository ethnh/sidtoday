(U//FOUO) Inviting Analysts at CIA and DIA to Collaborate With Their NSA Peers

FROM:
A\&P Information Sharing Policy \& Plans (S203B2)
Run Date: 08/03/2006
(U//FOUO) Have you ever wondered what all-source analysts do with our SIGINT? Have you often wished that you had access to non-SIGINT insights on a particular target? Well, now you don't have to wonder anymore. While NSA analysts across the extended enterprise have been sharing their expertise and knowledge for years, now we are encouraging our Intelligence Community analytic counterparts to do the same. In fact Analysis \& Production (S2) has made "Achieve a Collaborative Analytic Community" a strategic goal for 2007-2010.
(U//FOUO) One of the most important aspects of achieving this goal is to know with whom to collaborate on what. In order to do that, A\&P is regularly briefing CIA and DIA analysts on the A\&P missions and on our initiatives to perform collaborative analysis. Relatively new CIA and DIA analysts are introduced to A\&P missions and challenged to:

- build analytic relationships with A\&P analysts,
- identify good/bad business practices that help/hinder those relationships; and
- share their host agency's data and knowledge prior to the publication of all-source reports.
(C) On June 27th, a small group of CIA/ Directorate of Intelligence analysts visited SID as part of a new CIA course focusing on NSA. After being introduced to SID, they were briefed on A\&P and then met individually with analytic counterparts in specific mission areas. On June 28th, the CIA Customer Account Manager hosted another similar visit for Open Source Center (previously know as FBIS) analysts. And most recently, on July 13th, a class of approximately 25 DIA new hires, including analysts and linguists visited Ft. Meade for an orientation to NSA, including SID/A\&P. All three groups responded enthusiastically to the idea that they perform some level of collaborative analysis with NSA. Some analysts have already scheduled a return visit to A\&P for further analytic discussions.
(U) The exchanges described above were part of ongoing outreach and collaboration initiatives. They provide key opportunities to build and/or extend networks that lead to a stronger analytic community, not to mention more actionable SIGINT!
