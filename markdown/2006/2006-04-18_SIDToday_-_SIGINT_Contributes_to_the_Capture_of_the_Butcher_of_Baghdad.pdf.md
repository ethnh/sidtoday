(TS//SI) Terrorist Ahmad Abu 'Abdullah is captured due to SIGINT tipoffs from S2E2.
(TS//SI) On 9 April 2006, actionable intelligence provided by NSA's Iraq and Arabian Peninsula Division led to the capture of Ahmad Abu 'Abdullah, also known as the "Butcher of Baghdad." Close coordination between NSAW and Cryptologic Support Team (CST) elements was the key ingredient to this successful operation and the takedown of this Iraqi insurgent leader.
(TS//SI) The Iraq and Arabian Peninsula (S2E2) Sunni/Counterinsurgency team identifies and tracks selected mujahidin cells in the Abu Ghurayb region, including this assassination cell, led by Abu 'Abdullah, targeting Shi'a politicians. S2E2 produced tippers and intelligence on Abu 'Abdullah's plans to meet with associates in the Khan Dari region, which is west of Baghdad in the Abu Ghurayb area. Working very closely with CST personnel embedded with the U.S. Army 4th Infantry Division and 10th Mountain Division, S2E2 analysts provided the selectors that allowed Marines of 1 MEF (1st Marine Expeditionary Force) to track 'Abdullah and capture him when he stopped at one of his traditional bed-down spots.
(TS//SI) This capture impacted the leadership within this insurgent cell and led to the targeting of other key figures within the network. S2E2 analysts have recently linked cell members to the Islamic Army of Iraq, another Sunni-dominated resistance group with links to al-Qa'ida in Iraq (AQIZ). Tactical HUMINT teams forward and SIGINT tippers contributed to the intelligence on 'Abdullah's plans. 1 MEF used an active interrogation device to precisely locate Abu 'Abdullah based on the selectors that the S2E2 analysts were tracking.
(S//SI) The capture of the "Butcher of Baghdad" represents, once again, that national and tactical SIGINT collaboration is essential and intelligence supplied in near real-time is critical to the success of our war-fighters forward in Iraq.
