(TS//SI) A major insurgent figure in Iraq, , was captured by U.S. forces in June 2006, following the "ground-up" development of his group's communications. A number of elements -- NSA-Washington, NSA-Georgia, Cryptologic Support Team (CST) elements and U.S. Marines -- worked together closely to ensure that was captured. Here's how the story unfolded:

# (TS//SI) NSA-W Team Focuses on the 1920 Revolutionary Brigade 

(TS//SI) The Iraq and Arabian Peninsula (S2E2) Sunni/Counterinsurgency Team at NSA-W identifies selected mujahedin cells. Based on HUMINT, in 2005 the Team began tracking the 1920 Revolutionary Brigade*, which is suspected of having ties with al-Qa'eda in Iraq. This nationalist insurgent group is comprised mostly of members of the Saddam Husain regime, to include intelligence officers, military members, and Ba'ath Party members. Development work led by NSA-W's Counterinsurgency Team uncovered the organizational structure for the Revolutionary Brigade in the volatile, western al-Anbar Province and revealed the identities of two major figures, brothers.

## (TS//SI) NSA-Georgia SIGINT Points to

(TS//SI) NSA-W handed over the target to its counterparts in Georgia in early 2006. Interest in activities was piqued in January, when NSA-G reported that he was claiming involvement in improvised explosive device (IED) attacks in Fallujah and Baghdad. Although the context of claims suggested he was either bragging or joking, the fact that his brother, had already been identified as an insurgent leader was sufficient to warrant further monitoring. Subsequent SIGINT indicated probable involvement in both weapons trafficking and mortar attacks.

## (TS//SI) Marines Target $\square$ nd His Brother

(TS//SI) In Spring 2006, NSA-W resumed monitoring of the Brigades, when NSA-G was obliged to drop monitoring in favor of higher priority targets. After reacquiring the target, NSA-W reported lamenting the deaths of five colleagues who had apparently died in early April when several IEDs exploded prematurely. Close monitoring through April and May provided an almost daily synopsis of the group's activities. Utilizing both tippers and traditional reporting, NSA-W notified the Marine 1st Radio Battalion analysts in alAnbar Province, in addition to CIA Headquarters, of the brothers' activities. Acting on this information, the Marines drew up target packages on the brothers, tasking their communications for local coverage.

## (TS//SI) SIGINT Tipper Leads to Easy Arrest

(TS//SI) Monitoring by the Marines in June indicated intentions to travel to alBasrah. Subsequent monitoring by NSA-W verified that planned to visit an associate jailed at the U.S.-controlled Camp Bucca detention facility in al-Basrah. NSA-W tipped the Marines to this information, who, in turn, notified U.S. forces at the camp. signed into the camp on 15 June, using his real name (see photo.) After visiting his associate, who turned out to be another brother, was arrested by U.S. forces without conflict, in an operation described by a senior U.S. Marine as "the way it's supposed to work."

(TS//SI) The successful apprehension of this insurgent figure highlights the highly effective results that close collaboration between national and tactical SIGINT offers our war-fighters in Iraq.
