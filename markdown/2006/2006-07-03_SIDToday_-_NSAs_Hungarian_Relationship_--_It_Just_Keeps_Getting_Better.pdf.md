(S//SI) NSA's Hungarian Relationship -- It Just Keeps Getting Better!
FROM:
Country Desk Officer - Hungary (DP11)
Run Date: 07/03/2006
(S//SI) NSA and Hungary broaden cooperation on targets in Eastern Europe, continue work on terrorism and other targets.
(S//SI) Col Tibor P치szka, Director of Hungary's Military Intelligence Organization's SIGINT Directorate, hosted the 2006 US-Hungary Annual Planning Conference (APC) in Budapest on 4 and 5 April 2006. Management from MIO SIGINT's Analysis and Production, Data Collection, SRTD, Research and Development, and Foreign Relations divisions participated in the conference, which was attended on the US side by representatives from FAD (Foreign Affairs Directorate), the Office of Russia, International Security Issues' Ukraine office, and Regional Target's Balkans Division. The conference agenda covered the gamut from technical to analytic issues, providing two full days of briefings, discussion, and operations floor tours.
(S//SI) After opening remarks from both sides, briefings were presented that provided a quick review of the past year and proposed joint endeavors for the coming year. Highlights for the past year included:

- Two major surveys
- Microwave survey that resulted in a Hungarian accommodation buy for equipment to collect against Ukraine civil targets
- SATCOM survey that produced a continuing flow of new intelligence on various topics
- Increased MIO processing capability Installation of a PROFORMA collection system (from which the MIO is producing multi-media reports)
- Continued reporting (in English) on the Balkan and Ukraine military targets
(S//SI) Col. P치szka noted that MIO's mission has changed from a solely military one to a security-related mission with a broader charter. Although MIO is still interested in military activities near Hungary's borders, and maintains troop protection as one of its highest priorities (Hungary has troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo), it now also considers terrorism, smuggling, crime and corruption, and illegal trade as high priorities.
(S//SI) Col. P치szka reiterated his organization's commitment to the partnership with NSA. He requested further technical advice and methodology, noting that he would like to be able to share more intelligence with us, while better supporting domestic needs. In exchange for such assistance, Hungary offered skills and access, as well as honesty and friendship.
(S//SI) The honesty and friendship were evident throughout the conference. Open, frank discussions enabled the participants to reach consensus on many issues, and to agree on the direction for the partnership over the coming year. Activities proposed for this year include:
- Continued MIO reporting on the Balkans, Ukraine, Global War on Terrorism, and Africa
- MIO provision of SIGINT on Russia and CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)
- Expansion of the exchange on the Ukraine to include civil, as well as military targets
- Follow-on SATCOM survey SIGDEV training for MIO analysts
(S//SI) It was encouraging to see how well our interests continue to mesh, and to see first-hand how far our Hungarian partner has come in the past year. MIO has consistently supported our requirements. Col P치szka stated that MIO would do its best to fill our gaps - "consider MIO as your site." I'm not sure it gets any better than that!
(S//SI) APC attendees take a break to enjoy a Hungarian buffet lunch.
