# Course Overview: 

(U//FOUO) Once a key element of US foreign and security policy, Southeast Asia has spent the past several decades overshadowed by its economically and militarily stronger neighbors to the north, yet remains strategically significant to regional actors and the United States for issues ranging from counterrorism and piracy to regional security architecture. Although poor political practices have threatened internal stability, incubated insurgencies, and in many cases hampered badly needed economic growth, globalization, the proliferation of information technology, and political maturation are creating pressure for greater democratization. How will this play out in Southeast Asia? How do "Asian values" resist or reinforce trends in democratization? Will their "democracy" look like our "democracy"? What role does/should the US play, and what are the stakes for Washington? For the rest of the region?
