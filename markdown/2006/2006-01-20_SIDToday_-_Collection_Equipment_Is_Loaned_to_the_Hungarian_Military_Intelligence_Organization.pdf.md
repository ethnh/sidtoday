(S//SI) Collection Equipment Is Loaned to the Hungarian Military Intelligence Organization

ETC Mission Operations (F255)

(S//SI) Hungary is loaned DNR, DCME, and voice and fax processing equipment to assist in the War on Terrorism and the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan; training also provided.
(S//SI) Hungary is a partner in the global war on terrorism and continues to support coalition efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In support of the increasing requests NSA is making of this partner, the European Technical Center (ETC) provided long-term loan equipment and training to the Hungarian Military Intelligence Organization (MIO) in early November. During the five-day training period, MIO analysts were split into three groups and provided hands-on training for Third Party-releasable Dialed Number Recognition (DNR), Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment (DCME), and voice \& fax processing solutions.
(S//SI) The Hungarian MIO did not have a robust DNR or DCME capability prior to this equipment loan, forcing them to manually process more than 8,000 cuts per day. This suite of tools gives the ability to produce better survey and collection results and increases their effectiveness to respond to intelligence needs. During a live demonstration of how all three systems work together, a facsimile was intercepted that revealed a link of high intelligence value. This was a very timely and fitting example of how relevant and valuable this capability is for both the MIO and the USSS (US SIGINT System).
(S//SI) LIGHTSWITCH is a low-cost, rack mountable, PC-based DNR chassis, which can input and process up to 960 channels from CEPT E1 signals or BELL T1 signals. ETC personnel provided in-depth training that covered critical user functions as well as administrative procedures. Recognizing that it was impossible to teach everything found within the hundreds of pages of training documentation in just five days, the focus was to build upon the DNR training that the MIO received from NSA one year ago. Trainees were able to apply these concepts using the LIGHTSWITCH unit against live signals.
(S//SI) SWORDFISH is a LINUX-based exploitation capability that performs identification and full decompression capability for eight different types of DCME signals. MIO signal analysts received the training needed to utilize this tool during future signal surveys. Additional training on visual E1 characterization techniques using the Data Viewer Tool (DVT) was also provided to make more effective use of SWORDFISH.
(S//SI) ONEROOF is a software/hardware suite developed to provide a media-independent recording and processing solution to a variety of SIGINT operations. The MIO will use this primarily for voice and fax processing. This system accepts E1 input from existing collection and survey systems as well as LIGHTSWITCH and SWORDFISH. The voice, fax and signal-related output is formatted and presented in a format that is standard throughout the SIGINT community. This will enable the MIO field operations to appear as a seamless partner in the intelligence community. ETC also assisted the MIO with integrating ONEROOF clients into their language analysis laboratory and provided hands-on training for administrative and user-level functions.
(S//SI) ETC is scheduled to conduct a complete satellite survey with the MIO in January 2006, which will demonstrate the full potential of these tools. It is anticipated that the MIO will be capable of responding to NSA collection and survey requirements by this time.
