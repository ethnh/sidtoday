(U//FOUO) With the approach of the Veterans Day holiday next week, SID today invites its readers to tell us about the most remarkable Veterans Day commemoration or event they ever experienced. We ask that contributors capture their recollections in a couple of paragraphs and send them to $\square$ nsa. If we get some submissions, we will post them next week as a SID today article. Thank you!
