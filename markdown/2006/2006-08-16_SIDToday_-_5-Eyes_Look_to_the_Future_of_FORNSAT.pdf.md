(S//SI) 5-Eyes Look to the Future (of FORNSAT)
FROM:
FORNSAT Division (S3312)
Run Date: 08/16/2006
(S//SI) The FORNSAT Division hosted the semi-annual COMSAT Advisory Board (CAB) on 10-11 July at the FORNSAT site in Sugar Grove, W. Va. (TIMBERLINE). Representatives from the 5Eyes FORNSAT community and various FORNSAT sites participated and discussed current and future topics of mutual concern.
(S//SI) The attendees were briefed on TURBULENCE, which clarified the impact of Transformation 3.0 on FORNSAT modernization initiatives across the 5-Eyes Community. The 5Eyes Heads of Delegation reached consensus on several key issues, including:

- A Memorandum of Agreement signed by all Heads of Delegation that paved the way for sharing selected data fields of the FORNSAT Environmental Knowledge Base (ROADBED.net) with Third Party partners (see related article)
- A Memorandum of Agreement signed by all that addressed the cost-sharing of SHAREDVISION life-cycle support (see background)
- An understanding of issues related to SHAREDVISION system accreditation and licensing agreements
- A way forward for "life after SHAREDVISION"
- A virtual, interactive session within 90-days to follow-up on issues that should not wait until the next CAB (Feb 07, Australia's Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) as the sponsor).
(U//FOUO) A complete report from the CAB will be published in meeting minutes and salient points will be briefed to the Global Network Forum, which will be hosted by the New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) in October 06.
