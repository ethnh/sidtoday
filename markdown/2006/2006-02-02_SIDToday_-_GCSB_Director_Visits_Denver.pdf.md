# (U) GCSB Director Visits Denver 

FROM: $\square$
Foreign Affairs Officer, NSA/CSS Colorado
Run Date: 02/02/2006
(S//SI) Early in November, with the snow-capped Rocky Mountains in the background and Denver temperatures near 75 degrees, NSA/CSS Colorado welcomed the historic visit of Dr. Warren Tucker, Director, GCSB, and , New Zealand Liaison Officer Washington.
(S//SI) NSA/CSS Colorado, a tenant at the Aerospace Data Facility, successfully arranged site overviews and a floor tour of the operations area that focused on the Maritime Analysis Support Team (MAST), PROFORMA, and Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) areas. Many opportunities for an expansion of the already close Tech SIGINT partnership were discussed, and follow-on actions were taken on both sides to make better use of analytic resources and GCSB's collection capabilities.
(S//SI) While visiting NSA/CSS Colorado, Dr. Tucker and $\square$ were briefed on NSA/CSS Colorado's capabilities and future direction, and they received briefings from the MAST, the SEI team, and the National Technical ELINT Center. GCSB offered further collaboration in these areas by agreeing to provide NSA/CSS Colorado with an awareness of plans for military flights and deployments for possible Tech SIGINT collection. This information is already being provided to PACOM, but will now allow NSA/CSS Colorado to provide a list of signals of interest to GCSB. Dr. Tucker also agreed to explore the possibility of future real-time forwarding of data while flying P-3 missions.
(S//SI) During a Senior Leadership Roundtable, Dr. Tucker noted that one of his priorities is to place an integree in NSA/CSS Colorado, specifically the MAST. NSA/CSS Colorado is eager to host a GCSB integree and agreed to work policy issues in order to accommodate integrees in addition to those from Australia and the United Kingdom. In the meantime, NSA/CSS Colorado is exploring other options for hosting and training GCSB personnel in Denver. Dr. Tucker was very interested in the Tech SIGINT Training organization that is being established in Denver and would like to start sending personnel to traditional and non-traditional training opportunities being offered at the facility. NSA/CSS Colorado believes this is a very realistic goal.

(U//FOUO) No visit to Colorado would be complete without a trip to The Fort restaurant for a hearty meal and a step into the early West. Dr.Tucker, and the NSA/CSS Colorado leadership team traveled to the foothills where they dined on award-winning buffalo filets, salmon, bison "boudies" sausage, and queso fundito - the only queso you have to cut!! The Fort's nine dining rooms, all with two-feet-thick adobe walls, beamed ceilings, and midnineteenth century artifacts, are built around a central courtyard that features a typical Plains Indian tipi, a trading post, an adobe oven, and a crackling fire. The Fort has hosted many world leaders, including the G-8 Summit, and one member of the party even sat in Boris Yeltsin's chair! The flags from the G-8 Summit are proudly displayed around the courtyard, but upon our departure, it was agreed that the New Zealand flag should now be flown as well.
