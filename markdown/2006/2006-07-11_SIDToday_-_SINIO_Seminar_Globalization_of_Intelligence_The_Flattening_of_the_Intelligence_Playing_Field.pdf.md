# Course Overview: 

(S) Borrowing a concept expounded by Thomas Friedman in his book "The World is Flat," this seminar will look at three forces that are changing the intelligence environment and leveling the playing field. Everyone has or is getting access to a "Dick Tracey decoder ring," so the question arises as to how the U.S. Intelligence Community can achieve and maintain the intelligence advantage over this playing field. This seminar will identify the three forces and their impact on the SIGINT Community.
