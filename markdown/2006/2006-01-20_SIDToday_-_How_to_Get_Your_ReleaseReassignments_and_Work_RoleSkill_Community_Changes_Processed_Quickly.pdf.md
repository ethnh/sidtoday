(U) How to Get Your Release/Reassignments and Work Role/Skill Community Changes Processed Quickly

FROM:
HR Service Center for SID (MD6)

(U) Want to expedite the handling for your release/reassignment requests as well as your request for work role changes and change in skill community? Here's some information on how to avoid processing delays when you submit your paperwork to HR:
(U) What are the most common reasons for delay in getting your requests processed?

- SPF's (Staff Processing Forms) without complete information (see template below)
- HR receiving an SPF that has not been signed off on by everyone on the distribution list
- Job duties not provided when a work role change is involved
- SPF's that request multiple actions, especially a skill community change in combination with release/reassignment and work role change, where the employee has not begun the process for skill community change independently via email
(U) Here are some simple steps to speed up the process:
(U) Procedures for processing Release/Reassignment requests:
- The employee and/or supervisor prepares an SPF.
- The template below is the best format for assuring that all the required information is provided.

PURPOSE: This is the information we request in the body of the SPF for requesting a release from an employee's current position in (current org.) for reassignment in (new org).

NAME:
SSN:
GRADE:
CURRENT ORGANIZATION:
CURRENTLY FULL TIME/PART TIME
CURRENT POSITION NUMBER:
CURRENT SKILL COMMUNITY:
CURRENT WORK ROLE:
CURRENT SUPERVISOR:
NEW ORGANIZATION:
NEW POSITION IS FULL TIME/PART TIME
NEW POSITION NUMBER:
NEW SKILL COMMUNITY:
NEW WORK ROLE:
NEW SUPERVISOR:
NEW BLDG/LOCATION: HQTRS:
PROPOSED EFFECTIVIE DATE:

- Once all of this information is completed on the SPF, the requestor needs to make sure that all the names and titles in their chain of command necessary for approving such a request are on the distribution list. This includes managers from both the losing and gaining organizations.
- Once all of the signatures from losing and gaining organizations have been obtained, the SPF should be sent to the HR Program Manager of the losing organization for signature and processing through MD (the Human Resources Directorate).
- When all required information is verified and annotated (valid position number, accurate supervisory data and skill community, etc.) a personnel action will be completed and the updated information will appear on the employee's profile.
(U) SPF's which involve a change in Skill Community:
- The employee needs to contact the director of the new skill community via email with a request for the change
- That email should include the employee's ISR (should be updated to reflect recent job experience) and the employee profile from Concerto, as well as the nature of the work being performed in new position
- Email should be addressed to Skill Community Director, copying supervisor and HR Advisor
- The Skill Community Director will then respond via email with their decision to all parties
- Once the HR Advisor receives that email, the change to the employee's skill community will be processed in PeopleSoft by an HR Technician, to include any authorization for premium pay eligibility
(U) SPF's including a change in Work Role:
- On the SPF, please include job duties that reflect the new Work Role. The "Work Role Finder" available to supervisors through their Manager's Direct Access in Concerto is an excellent tool to identify these duties.
