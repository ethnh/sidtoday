(S) SECDEF says SIGINT is crucial to success in Iraq and praises expeditionary deployments.
(TS//SI) The Officer-In-Charge (OIC) at Special Collection Service Mosul had a rare opportunity to participate in a briefing for Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld at FOB* Courage on Christmas Eve day. Major General Rodriguez, commander of Task Force Freedom, gave the brief, which was also attended by commanders of Task Force North and the 172nd Stryker Brigade, as well as officers in charge of local DIA and CIA operations.

(TS//SI//REL) The Secretary had a chance to hear the site role in collection, in identifying, developing, and tracking high-value targets, and in providing threat warning, after-action reflections, and voice identification of targets. OIC pointed out that this collection is disseminated to local military units, and also used by NSAW and NSA Georgia for both tactical and strategic reporting.
(TS//SI//REL) In response to specific questions from Secretary Rumsfeld, the process of voice identification was explained. The Secretary was pleased to learn that although the phone is actually what is targeted initially, linguists use the content of a call (or series of calls) and voice together to provide verification of the target before action is taken.
(TS//SI//REL) Both MG Rodriguez and commander TF North lauded the value of SIGINT to their operations, and complimented SCS and NSA, mentioning QUADRASPECTRE in particular. The Secretary was also impressed when the General explained the fusion cell concept and how and why it works so well, and was told that the number of fusion cells were limited only by the number of active SCS sites.
(TS//SI//REL) Secretary Rumsfeld noted that the work of the site and the other SIGINT warriors is the way the war will be won, and the war in Iraq attests to how our military and intelligence agencies have to become more expeditionary, agile and interconnected. Upon hearing that SIGINT personnel in the SCS sites were PCS* to the combat zone, he pounded his hand on the table and said, "Now, that's how we need to do it!"
