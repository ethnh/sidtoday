(U//FOUO) What's the Role of A\&P's Homeland Security Coordinator?
FROM: A\&P Staff
Unknown
Run Date: 08/08/2006
(U//FOUO) A few months ago, Analysis \& Production (S2) appointed (pictured) to the newly created position of Homeland Security Coordinator. In this interview, Mr. describes how this new position came about, and what it entails:

- (U//FOUO) Can you tell us how this Homeland Security Coordinator position started?
(S//SI) When I first came to ICN [International Crime \& Narcotics - S2F], NSA senior management gave me two tasks. The first was to work with the ICN leadership to develop a strategic plan for the future. This we began developing last year and published during the fall of 2005. The second goal was to take a look at how well we, A\&P, were doing against Homeland Security requirements and see what could be improved. As I looked into how we were satisfying the Homeland requirements, I noticed two specific areas that needed addressing.
(S//SI) The first was that Homeland Security was not just a sub-set of Counterterrorism. There are many aspects of Homeland Security that do not fit easily into CT but are important to the Homeland Security customers. Specific topics include a nexus between crime and terrorists; the spread of Avian Flu; the business of forged passports and visas, and the illicit trafficking in fissile materials. All these are considered dangers to the Homeland but not CT threats. The recent Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Worldwide Intelligence Need 2005-1269 demonstrates the full scope of this non-CT aspect of the Homeland Security mission.
(S//SI) The second was that virtually every Product Line across the Enterprise had a piece of the Homeland "pie" and there wasn't one Product Line (PL), an Issue Managers Team (IMT), or a Global Capabilities Manager (GCM) for Homeland Security. The product was being done, the requirements were being addressed, but nobody had a clear idea where the gaps were, what was or was not working, or what processes should be in place to continue to grow the mission.
(S//SI) We presented these insights to the Deputy Director for A\&P and he agreed to establish a single, A\&P POC for Homeland Security to take this big-picture responsibility. The Coordinator position was created to meet this need.

- (U//FOUO) What are the specific responsibilities of the A\&P Homeland Security Coordinator?
(S//SI) First and foremost, the Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator act as the Homeland Security advocates within A\&P across the Enterprise. We serve as the A\&P focal point for customer queries concerning support and advise the senior leadership on changes that might be needed. The Coordinator is responsible for developing an A\&P strategic plan for Homeland Security and serve as the A\&P Subject-Matter Expert for Homeland Security issues and policies.
(S//SI) Additionally, given the cross-organizational nature of this mission, we are charged with developing and implementing a governance plan for supporting the HLS mission. This plan will employ Working Groups/Communities of Interest at the analytic level and management boards to provide direction for the US SIGINT System in responding to HLS requirements across the Enterprise. The goal is to provide a structure and processes for ensuring Agency production, resources, and infrastructure are optimally aligned across Enterprise organizational lines to fully support the HLS mission.
- (U) What are your biggest concerns as Coordinator?
(S//SI) I have two major concerns. One is that our analytic workforce doesn't fully comprehend the worldwide scope of Homeland Security. With this mission, there are no borders. Stolen passports in Thailand, for example, are a Homeland concern. They just might turn up at a US point of entry. Homeland Security is not a domestic concern; it is a worldwide concern. Our A\&P workforce has to fully understand this to be effective.
(S/SI) The other concern I have is based on the cross-Enterprise nature of the Homeland Security mission. Reporters throughout the Enterprise are reporting on document fraud, money exchanges, alien smuggling, etc. -- all important Homeland Security topics. Yet, because Homeland does not have a Product Line per se, there is no one A\&P focal point looking for linkages, nexus, trends that might provide insights into the worldwide web of the supporting networks that threaten the Homeland. We have to find a way to connect these dots.
- (U//FOUO) How do you see this position vis-Ã -vis the NSA/CSS Representative at DHS Office?
(S//SI) I see this job supporting the NCR. What we provide is a single point of contact within A\&P for Homeland Security questions/issues. With the NCR DHS handling the customer relations, and the Coordinator interfacing with the production elements, I think we have an excellent balance.
- (S//SI) NSA/CSS Texas was designated as the Cryptologic Center for Homeland Security - how does this fit with the A\&P effort?
(S//SI) The breadth and scope of the Homeland Security topic means that the Cryptologic Centers and the rest of the extended Enterprise all have a role in supporting Homeland Security Intelligence Needs. NSA-Texas has been assigned a leading role for Homeland Security, with responsibility for defending the Southwest border and ultimately, for threats emanating from the south. The other Cryptologic Centers, Hawaii, Georgia and Denver, all have significant supporting roles as well. Our responsibility is to develop the overall A\&P strategy for support and make sure it is in synch with the Enterprise effort.
(S//SI) Remember, defense of the Homeland starts overseas; the Agency's worldwide effort is key in meeting Homeland Security customer's requirements. I see the Coordinator's role as making sure all the moving parts of this SIGINT support machine are working together. I encourage everyone to stay in touch with our efforts via the A\&P Homeland Security Coordinator web page .
