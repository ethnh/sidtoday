(U//FOUO) DANCEHALL Semi-Annual Data Call Coming Soon January 2007

FROM:
DANCEHALL Team Lead (S01)
Run Date: 12/29/2006
(U//FOUO) Next month, all civilian and military employees in the SID organizations and the Cryptologic Centers will be tasked to create or update their individual profiles in the DANCEHALL database. Managers will also be tasked to create or update mission position descriptions. Specific information and guidance will be forthcoming soon on this task. In the meantime, here is a review of what DANCEHALL is all about:

## (U) What Is DANCEHALL?

(U//FOUO) NSA has thousands of analysts engaged in the pursuit of Signals Intelligence and Information Assurance missions. How do we document these activities and ensure that analysts are deployed against missions in a way that is consistent with national priorities and maximizes limited resources? One mechanism is DANCEHALL, a multifaceted project that helps NSA to account for all civilian and military (active and reserve) personnel performing cryptologic missions throughout the global enterprise .
(U//FOUO) DANCEHALL is a relational database through which individuals document their mission knowledge, skills and experience. It is currently in use in SID organizations, the Cryptologic Centers, and the NTOC. Eventually this capability will include the Mission Ground Stations, field sites and other external activities conducting SIGINT missions.

## (U) How Is the Data Used?

(U//FOUO) The data in DANCEHALL allows managers to understand current human resource deployments, optimize staffing as missions and priorities change, and identify tools and training that may be needed. It can also be used to respond to external queries from Congress and the Intelligence Community (IC) on mission readiness and resource allocation. As a result, it is essential that you document your profile accurately. Please note that you will not be subject to an involuntary directed assignment solely based on the information you provide in DANCEHALL.
(S//REL) Looking on an even broader scale, DANCEHALL supports the DDNI/A* Analytic Resource Catalog (ARC), an IC database of analytic missions, skills, and knowledge. Analysts throughout the IC are required to update their individual profiles every six months, after which this data is forwarded to the ARC. NSA will forward data contained in DANCEHALL to fulfill this requirement. Note: For those with concerns about cover issues, the DANCEHALL team is addressing the matter and is committed to ensuring that sensitive information be handled appropriately.

## (U) Stay Tuned...

(U//FOUO) SID depends on you to make Dancehall effective! Watch
