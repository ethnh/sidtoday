(C) The International Security Issues Build-Out

(C) As the Analysis \& Production Mission Build Out Strategy was originally envisioned, International Security Issues (ISI) mission was to remain primarily based in Washington. However, as other product line mission plans began to mature, opportunities for ISI to expand its mission capabilities opened. Planning is underway that will involve ISI participation in build-out activities with NSA/CSS Georgia, NSA/CSS Hawaii, NSA/CSS Texas and the European Security Command. The ISI mission is further extended by its relationships with F6 and Second and Third Party foreign partners that provide valuable analytic insights as well as their technical capabilities.

## (U) NSA Washington Mission

## (U) Regional

(TS//SI) ISI is responsible for 13 individual nation states in three continents. One significant tie that binds all these countries together is their importance to U.S. economic, trade, and defense concerns. The Western Europe and Strategic Partnerships division primarily focuses on foreign policy and trade activities of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, as well as Brazil, Japan and Mexico. The division reporting also provides some key intelligence on military and intelligence activities in some of these countries. The Aegean and Ukraine division works all aspects of the Turkish target - diplomatic, governmental/leadership, military and intelligence.
(TS//SI) The intelligence reporting is a rich source of information on Kongra Gel and the movement of the PKK/Kongra Gel and other terrorism-related entities in Northern Iraq. Reporting on the Ukraine target is focused on diplomatic and governmental activities as well as Ukraine's role in modernizing the military of other high profile countries such as China, Iran, North Korea, India and others. Reporting on the Greek target is focused on primarily government and diplomatic communications. Both Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus are worked on a time-available basis.

## (U) Transnational

(TS//SI) ISI's Follow the Money (FTM) organization plays an important role in the Intelligence Community's Counterterrorism, Combating Proliferation and Anti-Kleptocracy strategies. FTM's counterterrorism efforts are focused on identifying sources, users and facilitators of terrorist finance including informal networks such as hawalas, and monitoring allies' compliance with U.S. Government requests to freeze or block assets.
(TS//SI) Similarly, FTM's counterproliferation efforts seek to provide early indications of state and non-state actors' attempts to

acquire missiles or other weapons of mass destruction as well as components associated with chemical, biological radiological and nuclear weapons. The organization also focuses on how certain foreign governments are using money to finance illicit activities, proliferation efforts or influence regional politics. Current efforts include Iran, North Korea and Venezuela.
(TS//SI) The Energy and Resource branch provides unique intelligence on worldwide energy production and development in key countries that affect the world economy. Targets of current emphasis are Iraq, Iran, Russia and the Caspian Basin, Venezuela and China. Reporting has included the monitoring of international investment in the energy sectors of target countries, electrical and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) upgrades, and computer aided designs of projected energy projects.
(TS//SI) The International Financial Policy branch reports on international financial and economic issues and activities of a global target set. Emphasis is placed on leadership plans and intentions, indications and warnings of financial vulnerability, financial health and economic activity and preparations for summits and other international fora. Iraq is one of the branch's principal targets. Reporting has provided critical insight into the inner workings and dynamics of the Iraq Finance Ministry, Central Bank of Iraq and Trade Bank of Iraq. Both National and Theatre policymakers trying to assess Iraq's ability to function independently use this intelligence.

# (S) Build-Out Support to Counterterrorism and Combating Proliferation 

(S//SI) Today, ISI is actively partnering with the Combating Proliferation (CP, S2G) and Counterterrorism (CT, S2I) product lines to incorporate financial intelligence analysis into their mission build-out plans. The idea is to integrate financial analysis with traditional target efforts as opposed to working the target from two separate perspectives, as is done in NSA Washington. ISI's longterm goal is to introduce financial analysis as part of the Intelligence Analysis curriculum so any target can be enriched with the use of financial intelligence. The first CP FTM-trained analyst arrives at NSA Texas in June. NSA Hawaii's CT effort has several analysts who partner with FTM on select Southeast Asia counterterrorism targets.

## (U//FOUO) NSA Texas

(TS//SI) While ISI has no official mission at NSA Texas, we benefit from analytic support in several target areas. NSA Texas provides SIGINT Development support to ISI's Venezuela Follow the Money effort. NSA Texas' Russian effort also assists ISI on the Ukraine target set. Ukraine military are deployed in a number of areas as UN peacekeepers; they also participated in the coalition effort in Iraq. NSA Texas will continue to follow the activities of the Ukrainians until the Russian mission transfer to AMOC (Alaska Mission Operations Center) and NSA Washington is complete.
(TS//SI) Texas and ISI are also engaged in discussions regarding the Mexico target set. After years of wallowing in the NIPF (National Intelligence Priorities Framework) basement, homeland security requirements are raising the importance of Mexico. The two organizations are discussing a division of effort. However, it is important to note that as this is not a build-out mission, it will require a realignment of existing resources. ISI and Texas are engaged in conversation with Regional Targets (S2A) and
International Crime and Narcotics (S2F) on how Mexico military and governmental targets fit into Texas' Southwest Border mission.
