(U//FOUO) New Spaces, New Faces at the Counterterrorism MMC
FROM: Ron Carback
Deputy ADD/CT and Director, CT MMC
Run Date: 01/30/2006
(C) The Counterterrorism Mission Management Center sets up shop next to NSOC, introduces info-sharing tools and welcomes external representatives.
(C) Regular readers of SID today have followed the development of the Counterterrorism Mission Management Center (CT MMC) from a germ of an idea in December of 2004 through its initial operating capability in temporary spaces in November of last year. Then last month, almost a year to the day after Major General Quirk named Mr. Lonny Anderson as the Associate Deputy Director for Counterterrrorism and charged him with establishing the CT MMC, the Center took up residence in newly refurbished spaces adjoining the National Security Operations Center.
(C) Featuring a 24/7 Operations Center with robust global communications capabilities, the CT MMC is beginning to fulfill its charge to assist in the synchronization of global SIGINT operations, to act as the NSA's "one-stop shop" for CT SIGINT and to serve as the principal point of contact for the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).

(C) To provide situational awareness to all CT SIGINT mission elements, the CT MMC Operations Center staff reaches out and gathers the most pertinent and essential intelligence and operations information from around the world to produce its daily, on-line summary of key activities, CT Today. You can find it via the CT MMC web site - "go ctmmc."
(C) While looking at our web site, you will also notice a tab for the Strategy Forum, which is used by the CT regional strategy leads as a repository for the various regional strategies, implementation plans, and conference notes. There is also a blog or forum for discussion among the regional strategy communities of interest.
(C) Further, you will also find a tab for the Terrorism Wiki, an enterprise-level knowledge base and repository of information on terrorist groups and individuals. When fully developed, it is intended to serve as a means to share information on various terrorist groups as defined by the Interagency Intelligence Committee on Terrorism (IICT) and their membership.
(S//SI) Finally, while the CT MMC is a SID entity, we are joined by representatives from CIA's Counterterrorism Center (CTC), the Special Operations community, and in the near future, the FBI. These liaison officers provide excellent visibility into counterterrorism strategies, plans and operations, and they enable the CT MMC to work more effectively with warfighters and policymakers.
