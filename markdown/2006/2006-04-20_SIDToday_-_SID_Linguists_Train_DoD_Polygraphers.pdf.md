# (S) SID Linguists Train DoD Polygraphers 

FROM:
SIGDEV of Russia, Special Language Support (S2H1)
Run Date: 04/20/2006
(S) Special Language Support Branch (SLS) linguists recently helped train Department of Defense (DoD) polygraphers being sent to Afghanistan. As part of this training, which was run by the DoD Polygraph Institute based at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, four SLS linguists and adjuncts played "interpreter-subject" teams to help familiarize the polygrapher-trainees with how to effectively work with an interpreter while conducting polygraphs in the field. Arabic and Farsee linguists also participated in the training.
(S) Because the SLS linguists have extensive experience interpreting in the field and have interpreted for actual polygraphs given in the field, they were able to add real-world experience to the training. They embellished the training scenarios, making them more "realistic," and had informal discussions with the trainees about how to most effectively use an interpreter in field conditions, and how cultural differences and different world views might affect the polygraph sessions.
(U//FOUO) The polygraph is being used increasingly as a tool to "vet" information provided by local informants (hopefully preventing loss of US/coalition lives) and to screen potential employees.
