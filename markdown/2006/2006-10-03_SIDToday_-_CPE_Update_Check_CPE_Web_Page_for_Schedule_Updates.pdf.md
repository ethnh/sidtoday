(U) CPE Update: Check CPE Web Page for Schedule Updates

FROM:
Chief, ISS's Marketing and Communications Branch (S12M2)
Run Date: 10/03/2006
(U//FOUO) The Content Preparation Environment (CPE) is scheduled to begin replacing SIGINT On Demand (SOD) over a 7week period starting the week of 2 October. While we have disseminated the CPE rollout and training schedules via email and SID today, the most up-to-date and accurate version will always reside on the CPE web page ("go cpe"). Because these schedules may still fluctuate somewhat, we recommend that all potential CPE users refer to the web page in order to stay abreast of any lastminute changes to the rollout and training schedules.
