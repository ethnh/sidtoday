(U) CPE Rollout Delayed

FROM:
Chief, ISS's Marketing \& Communications Branch (S12M2)
Run Date: 05/26/2006
(U) Based on results from the recent round of user testing, the incremental rollout of Content Preparation Environment (CPE) (the SIGINT On Demand (SOD) replacement tool) 1.0 will not begin in June as originally planned, to allow time for tool refinement.
(U) We are committed to delivering a viable tool this summer, possibly as early as July. Deployment will not be driven by an artificial deadline, and if CPE 1.0 does not meet expectations by July, its rollout may be delayed again until we feel confident that we are ready to provide users with the best possible product.

# (U) Upcoming 

(U) Further details on CPE will be forthcoming on a regular basis via CPE communiqu√©s between now and the new rollout date. For more information on CPE, please visit the CPE website ("go cpe").
(U) For background, see an earlier SIDtoday article on CPE.
