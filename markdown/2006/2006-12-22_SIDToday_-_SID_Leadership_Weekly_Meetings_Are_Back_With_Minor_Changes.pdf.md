(U//FOUO) After a one-month hiatus, SID weekly leadership meetings have resumed, and the notes are again being published on SID today ! The meetings have undergone a couple of slight modifications, however. To more accurately reflect their focus, the "SID Morning Meetings" have been renamed the "Weekly SID Operational Meetings." In addition, they are now scheduled to occur on Wednesdays at 0800 (rather than 0730).
(U//FOUO) As in the past, notes from the meetings appear as a link under the "SID Notes/Reports" section of the SID today page. All are invited to read these notes regularly.
