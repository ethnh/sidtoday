(U) The SEL's Role
(U//FOUO) The SID Senior Enlisted Leader bears many responsibilities. In addition to serving as an advisor to me and other SIGINT leaders, he also acts as the internal assignment manager for military personnel within SID. He advocates for military personnel and helps to shape policy on issues that affect the military workforce and mission. He keeps the lines of communication open between me and the military workforce and the civilian workforce who serve with them.
(U) Farewell to
(U//FOUO) CMSgt replaces SGM , who retired after 30 faithful years of service to his country. During his two and a half years in SID, SGM did much to improve the military assignment process and helped improve military training procedures and the awardstracking process. He also enhanced civilian-military relations across the directorate. I thank SGM for his outstanding contributions and wish him the best in his retirement.
