(U//FOUO) Two Seminars, Panel Discussion Planned for Analysis Conference

Run Date: 04/07/2006
(U) The Annual Analysis Conference will be here before you know it, so be sure to sign up for all the wonderful events which interest you. Some that are sure to spark an interest are those that are sponsored by the Institute for Analysis.
(U) On Wednesday, 3 May, the IFA will sponsor two 90-minute seminars (see below). Check the analysis conference registration page to find out the specifics regarding times and locations.

# (U) The Art and Science of Narrative 

(U) What comes after good analysis? The story. The best ideas are understood and acted upon not only because of their analytic rigor, but also because they are presented in a way that captivates decision makers. In this 90 -minute seminar we'll explore the art and science of narrative and learn pragmatic tips for making analysis accessible and actionable. Drawing on the work of Betty Sue Flowers and Steven Denning, the Institute for Analysis will present a framework and engage participants in interactive exercises to explore narrative in an analytic setting.

## (U) Structuring ill-defined problems

(U) The analytic challenges we face are increasing complex and difficult to define. The way we ask questions dictates the way we look for answers. In this 90-minute workshop, The IFA will present a workshop for effectively framing complex analytical challenges. Participants will explore ways of understanding customer needs, identifying data sources, exploring interpretive frameworks and effectively processing and communicating analysis with other analysts. Drawing on proven frameworks used in the IFA and in the business and social science communities, this workshop will focus on analytic challenges, which require open source information and involve analytic teams.

## (U) Panel Discussion on "The Future of Analysis - How the Best CEOs, Physicians, and Journalists Deal with Increasingly Complex Problems."

(U) On the closing day of the annual conference, Thursday, 4 May, at 0830 in the R\&E Symposium, the IFA will sponsor a 2-hour panel discussion on "The Future of Analysis - How the Best CEOs, Physicians, and Journalists Deal with Increasingly Complex Problems."
(U) Are the problems you are asked to solve growing more complex and difficult? Is technology changing everything about your work, but often not making you more efficient? Is managing the conflicting demands of different stakeholders or clients taking ever more time?
(U) The intelligence community is not alone in facing increasingly unstructured problems-problems of extraordinary complexity with a multitude of causal forces and interactions. A panel of experts representing three important disciplines--business, medicine, and journalism--will discuss their approaches to addressing highly unstructured problems and the future of analysis from their unique perspectives. These fields are particularly relevant to the intelligence community because they share a common set of challenges: the problems they face are becoming ever more difficult; their environment and ways of operating have been completely changed by technology; and they must deal with intense and conflicting demands from an array of constituencies and customers.
(U) The panelists (see below) will discuss how the best practitioners in their respective fields navigate the challenge of assessing information and accurately reflecting what they know and don't know to advise customers, decision makers, or readers; they will also share how these
practitioners use new technologies and new paradigms of knowledge management and communications to their best advantage. Each will address how they and the organizations they work with are trying to systematically update their own methods and mindsets to become more effective over time.
(U) Come learn how the future of analysis will play out outside the intelligence community, and how it will have an impact on you.

# (U) Panelists 

(U) Mark Fuller, the CEO of Monitor Group, will speak from the vantage point of business. In addition to running a large and diverse knowledge-based professional services firm, he has advised dozens of corporate clients on developing new knowledge architectures, optimizing human interaction with new technological capabilities, and managing organizational change -- exactly the type of issues the agency is facing.
(U) Dr. Michelle McMurry, head of the Aspen Institute's Health, Biomedical Sciences, and Society Initiative, will speak from her experience as a physician, scholar, public health administrator, and health policy expert for Senator Lieberman's 2004 presidential campaign. She has deep expertise in the vast new technologies available; the ethical and economic consequences of their use; and the pressure and confusion caused by ever increasing amounts of information (good and bad) going to patients, providers, payer organizations, and public sector groups--only some of whom are in a position to make wise use of the information they receive.
(U) Michael Zielenziger, former head of the Asia Bureau for Knight Ridder News Service and an experienced journalist, author, and scholar, will discuss how journalists are tackling these challenges both in the U.S. and in the very different cultural environments of Asia
and the Middle East. He has studied how widely dispersed but not always accurate information affects different political constituencies. He will address how this information flow and the resultant new competition are affecting the journalism profession--setting management against journalists, forms of media against one another, and dividing the journalists themselves--and how this is radically opening up what it means to be a "professional" journalist.
(U) Steve Weber, a political science professor and director of the Institute of International Studies at University of California at Berkeley, will moderate. The institute he directs is currently researching three hugely unstructured problems: the economic and public policy issues around open source business models in pharmaceuticals, software, and telecommunications; the nature of the war of ideas between the Islamic world and the West; and the future of the Sino-American great power rivalry. Steve has an M.D. as well as a Ph.D. in political science with a focus on how knowledge-intensive industries develop and affect workers, businesses, governments, and the global political economy.
