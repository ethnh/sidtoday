(C//SI) New SNA Tool (and More) to be Unveiled at Open House
FROM:
Chief, Social Network Analysis Workcenter (SSG12)
Run Date: 03/08/2006
(U//FOUO) You're invited! The Social Network Analysis Workcenter is hosting an OPEN HOUSE on 21 March 2006. During the open house, visitors will experience the new ASSIMILATOR tool first-hand, with hands-on demonstrations.
(C//SI) What is ASSIMILATOR? It is a new web-based technology for analyzing your targets' social networks. Using SIGINT content and other intelligence text as source data, ASSIMILATOR provides the means to:

- extract social relations from the manuscripts,
- store them in a specialized database, and
- perform operations on aggregated social network data.

ASSIMILATOR is the product of a partnership between sister divisions -- the Social Network Analysis Workcenter and Target Development Services.
(C//SI) Last month, the Target Analysis Center (TAC) announced the beta release of ASSIMILATOR. At last, SIGINT analysts can work collaboratively to exploit the social networks of targets that cross many topics of interest. After the open house, we'll begin taking ASSIMILATOR to the desktop.
(U//FOUO) The SNAW open house will run from 0800-1500 in the TAC Conference Room (2B3104). In addition to ASSIMILATOR demos, there will be an overview presentation, project displays, Q\&A sessions, and SNAW personnel on hand to answer questions.
(U//FOUO) For more information on ASSIMILATOR, type " go assimilator." in your browser. The SNAW is also offering training available from the SNAW wiki (type "go snaw").
