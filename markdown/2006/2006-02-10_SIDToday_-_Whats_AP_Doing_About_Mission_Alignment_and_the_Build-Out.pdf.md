## (U//FOUO) An interview with Donna Barbano, Analysis and Production's (S2) Director, Enterprise Management (pictured):

- Q: (U//FOUO) How would you describe the task you have been given as A\&P's Director, Enterprise Management?
(U//FOUO) On 15 November, my first day in this position, I knew I would be assisting A\&P with the strategy for mission alignment and the A\&P Build-Out. However, as the days have passed I have found that what this job entails is much more than mission alignment. I will be reacting to changes in the current plans and dealing with all A\&P governance issues enterprise-wide.
(U//FOUO) This pertains not only to the Cryptologic Centers (CC's), but to anywhere within the enterprise that A\&P has governance responsibilities, such as the Utah Regional Language Center, the Alaska Mission Operations Center, and the Meade Operations Center, among others. Simply put, I will do my best to make sure A\&P gets this historic endeavor right!
(U) I am also finding that this position means many things to many people. In time, I know it will evolve into something meaningful for all of us!
- Q: (U//FOUO) What is the difference between your job and that of the MARSOC PMO (Mission Alignment and RSOC Build-Out Program management Office)?
(U//FOUO) As I said, I'm charged with working with the A\&P Leadership (to include the Group Chiefs and Global Capabilities Managers and the Cryptologic Center Leadership) to oversee, at the senior level, the strategy for the build-out. The role of the PMO is to assist the A\&P Leadership Team with the planning, implementation, and coordination of mission alignment; to ensure that NSA/CSS assets and capabilities are in place to support mission build-out plans and strategies. In doing that, everything A\&P does must be in lock step with the PMO and vice versa. That may be a bit of an oversimplification, but those are the lanes of the road as I see them.
- Q: (U//FOUO) You say the Cryptologic Centers are within your span of influence. How will you have an impact in Texas, Georgia, Hawaii and Colorado when you "live" at NSA/CSS-Washington (NSAW)?
(U//FOUO) I see myself more as an advocate here at NSAW for both the Cryptologic Centers and the Operations
Centers. I hope they will use my staff and me to work high-level issues with other organizations at NSAW. The current members of

The alias S2_EMT should be used to reach all members of the virtual team. I ask that you include them on distro for any email correspondence you share with me.

- Q: (U//FOUO) Data Acquisition's Director of Enterprise Governance, $\square$ has been having site reviews. (See related article :) Will you be doing anything like that?
(U) I am considering joining with the MARSOC PMO to host twiceyearly sessions that will be a combination of site reviews and planning and implementation group meetings. $\square$ (Chief, MARSOC PMO) and I will co-chair these sessions that will bring together all stakeholders, including enablers, essential to each site's mission.
- Q: (U) The MARSOC PMO must be glad to be getting more help!
(U) We are still in the process of making the connection with the PMO. It is possible that we will be holding an offsite to sort out roles and responsibilities to avoid duplication of effort. There is more than enough work for all of us!
- Q: (U) What are some of the big challenges you see right now?
(U//FOUO) Getting our arms around the myriad of manpower issues and ensuring our A\&P policies are consistent across the enterprise are the two biggest challenges I see.
- Q: (U) What part of your career thus far has best prepared you for this job?
(U//FOUO) Every experience I have had from my most recent assignment as Deputy SUSLOL (Special US Liaison Officer London), my years as a French and Portugese language analyst, my many leadership positions from team chief up to Production Manager and the years on the Director's staff, among others, have taught me something I will use on this job. One thing is for sure -- coming back to A\&P is like coming home.
