(U//FOUO) Venture Capital Funding Is Available: InnoVisions Call for Proposals

FROM:
Technical Director, InnoVisions (S22N)
Run Date: 03/20/2006
(U//FOUO) Funding is available to test your idea.
(U//FOUO) Do you know of a commercial product that could be used to great effect in SIGINT operations? Do you have an idea for a QRC solution to a SIGINT problem, but need experts to build a proof-of-concept? Would you like the opportunity to implement your idea? If so, this may be your chance - InnoVisions (S22N) has issued a call for venture capital proposals, open to the entire SID workforce.
(U//FOUO) What is InnoVisions? It provides proof-of-concept demonstrations of early stage and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies against real-world SIGINT problems. The technology to retool the SIGINT system, in most cases, already exists. What is lacking is the creative environment that encourages innovation, rewards risk-taking and is result-oriented, not process-oriented. InnoVisions fills that gap. We are not a center of innovation, but rather a network of innovators.
(U//FOUO) We are assembling new venture capital starts, and solicit your suggestions for (1) specific challenges and/or projects against which we can match COTS and GOTS (Government-off-the-shelf) technology or (2) specific ideas for prototyping activities within SID. During this call for proposals, special emphasis is being given to the following topic:

- Very fast evaluation of COTS/GOTS tools that may affect SIGINT success -- especially those evaluations that could be accomplished in under 90 days and for under \$50,000. InnoVisions is providing this support as part of the GREENDRAGON project.

However, submissions can be from any organization and cover any topic. Type "go innovations" in your browser to get more details on current and past projects.
(C//SI) If you have an idea that you think can benefit the SID enterprise, could be demonstrated in 6-12 months, and cost less than $\$ 0.5 \mathrm{M}$ (the lower the dollar amount, the better), we invite you to tell us your idea. It is requested that proposals be submitted by 7 April 2006. Notification of award of these prestigious grants will occur around the end of April 2006.
(C//SI) How do I submit my idea? The InnoVisions "catechism" is the model by which all proposals are submitted to InnoVisions for consideration. All submissions must answer the questions within the "catechism." For catechism details, see this webpage:
(U//FOUO) Actual submissions can be made via the web submission form or they can be emailed (plain text, rtf, or MS Word, preferred) to:
