(U//FOUO) From 3 - 5 October, DIRNSA and Director GCHQ co-chaired the annual NSA-GCHQ Joint Management Review (JMR) at Chevening House. The meeting venue at Chevening is the official country residence of the UK Foreign Secretary. It is set in 27 acres of gardens, within an estate of 3,000 acres, located 23 miles south of London in the Kent countryside, and dates back to 1630. Former UK Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, visited Chevening during the JMR and spoke briefly with some of the JMR participants.

(U//FOUO) The JMR can be considered the top-level annual strategic planning event between NSA and GCHQ, and is complemented by a broad range of detailed UKUSA planning conferences conducted by various mission and support staffs throughout the year. The JMR traditionally opens with the Directors of GCHQ and NSA each offering an overview of their respective strategic landscapes followed by $1 \& 1 / 2$ days of focused meetings on select strategic UKUSA issues.

(S//SI//REL) This year seventeen senior leaders from across NSA and GCHQ participated -including DIRNSA and Director GCHQ, the mission directors for SIGINT and IA, senior general counsels, and senior technology/capability providers. The conference focused on three main areas: Counterterrorism, Computer Network Operations, and Metadata policy.
(C//REL) The JMR results can be characterized as broad agreement that the relationship remains strong across SIGINT, IA, and enabling/support functions, and a need to focus efforts to increase collaboration among SIGINT, HUMINT and Law Enforcement partners.
