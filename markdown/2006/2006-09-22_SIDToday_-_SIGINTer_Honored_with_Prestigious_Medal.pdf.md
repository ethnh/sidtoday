(S//SI//REL) Bronze Star Medal a rare honor for a SIGINTer...
(S//SI//REL) On 31 August, LTG Alexander presented the Bronze Star Medal to SSgt Vincent E. Perry, USAF, for specific contributions to the Global War on Terrorism. The Bronze Star is the nation's fourth highest combat award presented for heroic or meritorious achievement or service during operations against an enemy of the United States. It is rare for SIGINTers to receive the Bronze Star, because the nomination must come from someone other than NSA.

(S//SI//REL) While deployed to Iraq in support of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), SSgt Perry, a Meade Operations Center Geospatial Metadata Analyst, contributed to a team effort that was key in the elimination of a high-level Iraqi terrorist. Both GEN Meigs (Retired) (Director of the Joint Improvised-Explosive-Device Defeat Organization, and a threetime Bronze Star recipient) and LTG Alexander expressed their appreciation to SSgt Perry for his outstanding work, and each presented him with a coin.
(U) Well done!
