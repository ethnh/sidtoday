(S//SI) Croats May Hold Key to Vital Intelligence on Montenegro FROM: $\square$

(S//SI) The Croatian Intelligence Agency (OA) may have found the golden nugget the US Intelligence Community has been looking for to fill a high-priority Balkans intelligence gap. Intelligence on internal Montenegrin political affairs has been long sought after by the US and has become more important than ever, given that Montenegro's referendum on whether or not to declare independence from Serbia looms on the horizon this May.
(S//SI) The OA visitors wowed the room at a recent Annual Program Review when they announced that they have been able to intercept Montenegrin GSM* signals from their Molunat site in extreme southern Croatia. Even better was the revelation that those signals were being carried across the PSTN* on a 128 QAM signal, which NSA's Balkans Division has considerable experience exploiting.
(S//SI) When the partner requested help working the signal, the Balkans Division quickly offered to support a fast-track ETC (European Technical Center) survey to collect the signal and to examine the metadata. Time is of the essence, as the hope is to conduct the survey in midMarch, and to have results prior to the May referendum. If Montenegro does vote to secede from Serbia-Montenegro, having insight into their governmental communications will be invaluable.
(S//SI) The offer from OA was also important in that it is a change in behavior for this partner, who has traditionally provided SIGINT on the military and security situation in Bosnia and Serbia. This was one of the first times that the partner came in willing to work outside their comfort zone. The survey opportunity also represents an invaluable possibility for NSA to provide vital intelligence in support of a Tier A Priority 2 Intelligence Need that has long proved problematic to our customers.
