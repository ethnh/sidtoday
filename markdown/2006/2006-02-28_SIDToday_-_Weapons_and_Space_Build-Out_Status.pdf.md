(S) Weapons and Space Build-Out Status

FROM:
W\&S Global Capabilities Manager, NSA/CSS Colorado Run Date: 02/28/2006
(U//FOUO) Here's a new series that will explain how Analysis and Production missions are being allocated to sites worldwide:
(S) The Weapons and Space mission area (W\&S) is advanced in its build-out, and continues to move rapidly to increase its mission presence at the Cryptologic Centers and other locations. W\&S began its build-out well ahead of the other mission areas, as a result of a DIRNSA decision in 2001 to move a significant part of W\&S to Denver, Colorado.
(S) Starting in 2004, military and civilian billets began transferring from both Ft Meade and Field Station Denver (F75) to what became NSA/CSS Colorado (NSA/CSS-C). Additional billets were subsequently approved by the Associate Directorate for Human Resources to fill critical gaps.
(S) With an approved billet structure composed of 309 military and 131 civilian positions, NSA/CSS-C now has 133 military and 98 civilian positions filled, with more on the way. This has allowed NSA/CSS-C to create working S1, S2, and S3 elements, all supporting W\&S and its Technical SIGINT sub-elements of ELINT, FISINT, PROFORMA (a subset of COMINT) and RF Communications Externals (COMEXT).
(S) Currently NSA/CSS-C has the lead for the entire W\&S mission and strongest enterprise presence in ELINT (both operational and technical), RF COMEXT, and the multiSIGINT source Ship Tracking mission. Weapons FISINT, Space FISINT, and PROFORMA mission execution remains at Ft Meade, as well a small Technical ELINT cell and our critical Data Services element, which ensures the continued operation of Technical SIGINT databases, including WRANGLER and many others.
(S) Concurrently, plans were made to invigorate Technical SIGINT support at the other Cryptologic Centers. Prior to the build-out, Georgia and Texas both maintained a small Operational ELINT (OPELINT) capability, and Hawaii had a larger but not well resourced OPELINT and Technical ELINT (TechELINT) capability. A build-out to increase the capability of those missions and to add support in other Technical SIGINT mission areas began in 2005.
(S) Strong leadership for Weapons and Space has been established at each CC, and billets are being filled in ELINT, PROFORMA, and RF COMEXT sub-missions. TechELINT, is being worked as a standalone mission area with the Navy in Hawaii and Georgia (Texas will stand-up TechELINT mission at the end of FY06). SIGINT-based ship tracking has a robust capability in the MAST (Maritime Analysis Support Team) in Colorado. MAST cells are being created at each CC to address theater-focused ship tracking problems and to contribute, via interaction with the MAST leadership in Colorado,

to a global, inter-connected network of SIGINT-based ship tracking cells throughout the U.S. and partner communities.
(S) Beyond TechELINT and ship-tracking, TechSIGINT is primarily a support element to the geographic and functional TOPIs* resident there, to ensure that a fuller understanding of adversary activity can be developed. The infusion of PROFORMA, RF COMEXT and OPELINT to the available voice intercept makes for a more complete picture, and thus a better product for the customer. This is already working at each of Texas, Georgia, and Hawaii, with some already notable successes in Georgia where the fusion of TechSIGINT with COMINT is becoming more routine. With sufficient staffing, up to the originally approved levels, Weapons and Space will be able to embed TechSIGINT capability with TOPI elements to ensure that routine interaction and improved product.
(S) W\&S build-out also includes planning for a very small element at the AMOC in Elmendorf to support the Russian Air mission as described above (see related story, as well as mature discussions with the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio, to transfer full responsibility for analysis of detailed Technical ELINT data from the COMBAT SENT aircraft to that facility.
(U) Overall, the W\&S Product Line is already heavily built out in support of DIRNSA's plans, has considerable reach in the extended enterprise, and continues to move forcefully and rapidly to move additional people and mission to those locations where it is right to do so and to improve NSA's support to customers.
