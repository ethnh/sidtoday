(S) Middle East and North Africa Build-Out Status

(TS//SI) The Middle East and North Africa mission is performed at primarily two locations: NSA/CSS Washington (NSAW) and NSA/CSS Georgia (NSAG) and includes the geo-political and/or military targets of the following countries: Iraq, the Arabian Peninsula, Iran, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Libya, the Maghreb, the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian terrorist groups.
(TS//SI) From a MENA perspective, the build-out has been ongoing since 1995 when the former Fort Gordon Regional Security Operations Center (GRSOC) was created. At that time, GRSOC was focused exclusively on MENA mission and that continued to be the case until after the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 when GRSOC began to perform some mission in support of Counterterrorism and Regional Targets.
(TS//SI) Historically, Georgia was responsible for providing tactical support to the warfighter through near real time coverage of selected MENA military targets. When mission build-out to the Cryptologic Centers began, it therefore seemed logical to transfer most of the remaining MENA military targets to Georgia. In addition, under MENA's build-out plan, Georgia would assume responsibility for long-term analysis and assessment for all of the MENA military targets for which it already was assigned analytic and reporting responsibility. MENA leadership also designated a few positions in the UK (Menwith Hill Station, RAF Digby, and GCHQ) and in Germany (European Security Center) to perform mission in support of MENA.
(U//FOUO) Originally, MENA intended that its buildout efforts would be completed by the end of FY06. While still working toward that goal, given current hiring issues and the phasing required to fully transfer a mission, it is probably more realistic to expect completion sometime during FY07. One challenge has been identifying exactly what duties constitute the role of "target office of primary interest" or TOPI. To those who have had TOPI responsibilities for some time, this may seem second nature, but when assuming that role for the first time, many questions arise.
(TS//SI) As missions transfer, it is important to ensure such things as the handling of ORCON releases, sanitization requests, engagement with the full range of customers to include participation in Intelligence Community events, the managing of foreign relationships, etc., are all documented and that any training required to deal with these responsibilities is provided. With the added responsibilities also come additional travel requirements and associated funding issues. That has been MENA's focus over the last several months to ensure seamless support to customers as full responsibility for several missions shift from Washington to Georgia.

(TS//SI) The following describes MENA's build-out plans by location:

NSA/CSS Washington: (TS//SI) When the build-out is complete, MENA's Washington mission will consist of the geo-political targets in the Middle East and North Africa. Specifically, MENA Washington will have full responsibility for all analysis and production activities associated with issues related to the leadership, political stability, intelligence services, and diplomatic missions of its target countries. It will also be responsible for the Palestinian terrorist targets and for the IRGC Qods Force.

NSA/CSS Georgia : (TS//SI) MENA's goal for Georgia is to transfer full responsibility for most of MENA's conventional military missions, to include tactical and long-term support. When the build-out is complete, Georgia will have full responsibility for Iraqi, Iranian, Syrian, and Israeli military missions as well as Israeli and Palestinian Authority police forces. In addition, NSAG will be reponsible for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps conventional military forces. Since Georgia had responsibility for parts of some of these missions already, the build-out has focused on bringing in personnel to "get healthy" on these targets to enable the full transfer of responsibility.

European Security Center (ESC): (TS//SI) The ESC will host MENA's Libyan, Algerian, Moroccan, and Tunisian conventional military missions. Originally plans called for moving the MENA EUCOM-centric North African "strategic" military target to NSAG, but based on a business case presented by EUCOM, a decision was made to move most of this mission to the ESC. The one exception was the Libyan Navy, which is being worked at NSAG by Navy P2 assets. That mission will remain in Georgia. The numbers of personnel have been identified and the ESC and MENA are currently finalizing the mission transfer documentation. Hopefully, the mission transfer will be completed by the end of FY06 or early FY07.

Menwith Hill Station, RAF Digby, and GCHQ : (TS/SI) As part of its build-out strategy, MENA identified 10 positions to be transferred to these locations. At MHS, the positions were provided to support SIGINT Development efforts on select MENA targets. Once a target reaches a sustainable state, it is handed off to either NSAG or NSAW as appropriate. At RAF Digby and at GCHQ, MENA has identified positions to be integrated with UK counterparts to work sustained MENA mission at those locations. This is in keeping with established divisions of effort with GCHQ on the MENA target set.
(TS//SI) MENA also has worked with F6 to delegate responsibility for some MENA serialized reporting to a couple of sites with more to follow in the future. The MENA mission is further extended by its long-standing relationships with a number of Second and Third Party foreign partners that provide valuable analytic insights as well as technical capabilities.
