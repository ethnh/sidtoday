(S//SI//REL) Here are a couple of comments in response to the article "Flying BEAR Approach Alaska -- SIGINT Is Watching" :

# Comment: 

(S//SI) Glad to see HF Manual Morse is still being used to follow Long Range Aviation (LRA) bomber activity. FYI: The former USAFSS (US Air Force Security Service), HF Site at RAF Kirknewton, Scotland, 6952nd Radio Squadron Mobile's primary mission was LRA.
(S//SI) We used to track and CRITIC report bomber activity above the 82nd parallel on a regular basis in the early 1960s from their PVO (Air Defense) traffic. We didn't have the long-range or over-the-horizon (OTH) radars to track them, so when their radar ceased tracking whilst they were still heading north, we issued a typewritten CRITIC. Timely reporting without the bells and whistles...
(S//SI) I would like to add that ye olde antenna farm was the method of collection and we had great hearability because of the site's location. The CDAA (FLR-9) antenna at RAF Chicksands was in the testing stage at that time. We tracked the bombers to the Far East via Air-to-Ground and Air Defense comms all on little old HF morse and radio-printer.

## Comment:

(S) (The) article brought back memories of my TDYs to NCR (NSA/CSS Representative) Alaska during the 1980's. It was the Cold War and the Alaskan Air Command would almost always engage the BEAR aircraft as they flew along our shores. Our fighters got up close and personal with them, snapping photos and movies as the Russians gestured to them from their cockpit. (These) BEAR pilots were probably deeply disappointed that nobody came out to "greet" them.
