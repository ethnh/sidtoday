(U//FOUO) Audit of the GROUNDBREAKER Contract -- You May Be Contacted

FROM: Robert M. Bryant
SIGINT Mission Interface for Information Technology (S01)
Run Date: 01/18/2006
(U//FOUO) Starting this week, the Inspector General's (IG's) Office began an audit of the Asset Management and Cost Allocation of the GROUNDBREAKER (GB) Contract. The audit's primary objective is to determine if the Agency has put in place processes and controls to assure that GB asset management and resource units -- used as the basis for monthly service billings for Eagle Alliance (EA) -- are accurate.
(U//FOUO) The auditors are going to sample the Agency's assets and personnel population for which EA is responsible (those within the "50 mile radius" of NSAW). SID's audit size will be 452 assets and 226 personnel. The two areas of information the auditors are trying to validate for accuracy are: 1) personnel's Searchlight entry, and 2) assigned inventory assets (workstations, telephones, and mobile devices).
(U) For the Personnel Sample, the auditors will submit an e-mail to the personnel selected and request they answer the following questions:

- What is your current organizational code?
- What is your location?
- What are your secure/non-secure phone numbers?
- Have you moved/changed orgs since September 2005?
(U) If the auditors fail to obtain responses, they will contact the organization's POC and/or Human Resources to validate whether the individual is a current employee. For the Inventory Sample, the auditors will attempt to locate the assets selected in the sample; to do this, the auditors will be visiting SID workspaces to physically verify the asset's existence and confirm other asset information (Organization Code, Location, Assigned Individual).
(U) If you are one of the SID selected personnel, please make every attempt to facilitate this audit.
