(U) USSS Strategy and Long Range Plan: A Vocabulary Lesson

FROM:
SIGINT Performance Planning (S01X)
Run Date: 08/11/2006
(U) In the first article in this series, we mentioned the Long Range Plan - an 18-month implementation plan supporting the USSS Strategy. The Long Range Plan contains Milestones and Metrics associated with the Objectives under each of the Goals of the USSS Strategy (Placemat). You may ask what the difference is between an objective and a goal, or between a milestone and a metric. Here's a brief description of each.

- Goal: The words directly on the Placemat, a big-picture view of the desired end-state. The Placemat has three levels of goals (A-level -- mission, B-level -- capabilities, and Clevel -- running the Enterprise)
- Objectives: Specific focus areas under each goal, major components of the goal
- Measures or Metrics: Outcomes or outputs contributing to a desired end-state. Measures are compared to a performance target that is set based on available funding and manpower.
- Milestones: Events or check-points of significance to the completion of an objective. Completion of key milestones will allow a performance target to be met.
(U) Why does it need to be so complicated? Typically, goals are broad and encompass a myriad of activities. Objectives give the goals more depth and clarify what must be accomplished by identifying the major components. And what's the difference between a milestone and a metric?
(U) Milestones are discrete events. Measures, or metrics, show performance over time. It is possible to achieve all your milestones, and still not improve your metric if your milestones only allow you to sustain, rather than improve a capability. Milestones compliment the performance measures and demonstrate progress that will support the achievement of longterm performance targets. Milestones provide the near-term accountability that allows management to "manage" the strategy.
(U) To see some specific examples, go to the placemat ("go placemat" in your browser) and click on any of the goals for a hyper-link to the objectives, measures and milestones for key activities under that goal.
