(U//FOUO) Menwith Hill Takes a Page Out of GCHQ's Book

(U//FOUO) MHS has adopted GCHQ's "Event Manager" process to deal with intelligence crisis situations.
(U//FOUO) When a situation requires non-routine coordination across organizations, GCHQ ${ }^{1}$ responds by defining the situation as an "event" and assigning an Event Manager (EM) to spearhead that coordination. Examples of an event could be a "major UK military operation, a diplomatic event, an impending terrorist atrocity or the imminent destabilization of a region or country." ${ }^{2}$ This method for handling major events works well within the GCHQ framework, facilitating communication and coordination. Early this year, MHS decided to "give it a go" and apply the EM process at site.
(U//FOUO) Although the application of EMs differs between GCHQ and MHS, the goal is the same - to respond to crisis situations in a more effective manner, to speak with one voice to both internal and external customers and to ensure that all aspects of work are properly managed and coordinated. At Menwith, anyone with a deep knowledge of the situation could be chosen to be an EM, regardless of rank or grade.
(U//FOUO) Once an EM has been chosen, he/she is required to do the following:

- Confirm intentions of site leadership.
- Determine and disseminate the national posture (both US and UK).
- Identify POCs for all divisions at MHS.
- Build a system that facilitates information flow and exchange.
(S) To date, there have been several situations that required the EM process:
- the troop build-up in Afghanistan ${ }^{3}$,
- the increasing tension related to the Iranian nuclear situation ${ }^{4}$,
- the Nigerian hostage crisis ${ }^{5}$, and
- the recent hostilities in Lebanon. ${ }^{6}$

(S//SI) The Nigerian hostage situation in February prompted the first use of the EM process here at MHS. Menwith Hill had been supplying data analysis on suspect communications around the hostage location. To keep a closer eye on the situation and to provide focused guidance on collection requirements, MHS requested to be included in the SITREP distribution. This bridged NSA requirements with GCHQ requirements. Subsequently, MHS was invited to the ongoing EM video teleconferences (VTC) regarding the situation. This helped MHS to focus our resources on what was needed.

(S//SI) In addition, new strategic sources of intelligence were uncovered, putting MHS in a good position for future situations. The EM process broke new ground in establishing lines of
communication, data flow, situation reporting, VTCs and the exchange of skills between organizations. For instance, during the hostage crisis, two Scarborough linguists deployed to MHS to assist with voice processing.
(S//SI) Lessons learned from the Nigerian situation helped during the Lebanon crisis. For example, the POCs from the involved organizations and the EM met daily to discuss current activities and planning. The exchange of information was made even easier with the creation of a dedicated WIKI . Everyone involved contributed to the WIKI and the EM included a daily summary. It was especially useful for the Lebanon Noncombatant Evacuation Operation (NEO). The WIKI helped with immediate feedback and requests between divisions.
(S//SI) Menwith Hill now participates in VTCs with EMs at GCHQ two to three times per week. This sustained communication enables site to provide a better service to customers.
(U//FOUO) Menwith Hill will continue to use the event management process. Thanks to GCHQ, MHS has found a way to react to situations in a more coordinated fashion. The Director of Mission Operations sums up the event management process succinctly, "Event management is taking the concept of the project lead one step further into the intelligence arena. And just like a project shuts down when the project is completed, so too does an event. That is the way it is meant to be."
