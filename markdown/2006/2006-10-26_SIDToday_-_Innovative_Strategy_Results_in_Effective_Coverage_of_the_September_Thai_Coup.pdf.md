(S//SI//REL) Innovative Strategy Results in Effective Coverage of the September Thai Coup

(S//SI//REL) NSA HQ and Extended Enterprise elements take turns covering the Thai coup situation, using NSA's geographical distribution of SIGINT assets to its advantage.
(S//SI//REL) The Eastern Hemisphere Narcotics Branch and its extended enterprise partners employed a unique strategy in effectively covering the unfolding events surrounding the coup staged by the military in Thailand on 19 September.
(S//SI//REL) Available collection assets were focused on Thai leadership figures (for insights into political developments) and on military and security targets (for indications of ensuing violence and/or counter-initiatives that would pose a threat to U.S. and allied personnel in Thailand). In an innovative division of effort which minimized the number of off duty hours worked, S2F11 successively handed off processing and reporting responsibility for the target throughout the day, taking advantage of the various time zones in which the United States SIGINT System operates.
(S//SI//REL) At the end of the regular Washington-area workday, responsibility for coverage of coup developments was handed off to Field Station Utah, which in turn handed over responsibility to NSA Hawaii several hours later. Each work site produced an end-of-day summary that was shared with all involved parties to assure continuity and full understanding of target developments.
(S//SI//REL) This strategy ultimately permitted 18 hour-per-day coverage with no after-hours duty required at any of the involved work centers. This coverage was also complemented by round-the-clock operations by four FG regional sites, assuring that the SIGINT system would be poised to support any crisis contingencies that might have occurred.
