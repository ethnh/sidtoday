(S//SI) Reminder: Last Chance to Submit Abstracts for the 2006 Euro SIGDEV Conference

FROM:
New Mission Development Center, MHS (F77)
Run Date: 09/12/2006
(S//SI) Menwith Hill Station is proud to announce the 2006 European SIGINT Development Conference: SIGDEV in the TURBULENCE Era . This second annual event will be held 16-18 October 2006 at Menwith Hill Station, UK.
(TS//SI) TURBULENCE is a unified mission environment comprising next generation midpoint (passive) exploitation, endpoint (active) exploitation and attack, and active network defense along with the common infrastructure that underlies all four elements. There is no doubt that this new environment will bring with it successes and challenges. How the SIGDEV community operates in this environment will be key to its ultimate success.
(TS//SI) Each day of the conference will focus on the gaps, technology trends, and target behaviors for a specific target set (Global War on Terrorism, enduring threats, other/opportunities) and how this activity fits into TURBULENCE (or will in the future). Morning sessions will consist of briefings to provide a foundation for facilitated discussions (round tables) in the afternoons. All attendees should be prepared to fully participate in these discussions.
(U//FOUO) The conference will be opened with remarks by Mr. William Black, Special United States Liaison Officer, London (SUSLOL), followed by a keynote address by Mr. Leon Stanley, Chief NCEUR and former Associate Deputy Director for SIGINT Development. Dr. Patrick Dowd, Deputy Director for IT Modernization, will lay the groundwork for the conference by providing an overview and current status of TURBULENCE.
(S//SI) Euro SIGDEV 2006 will be followed by two days of Pre-SANAR*-6 workshops at Menwith Hill Station. The workshops will focus on the same theme with the emphasis on network analysis. The TURBULENCE environment will require new and unusual techniques and methods in the key areas of change detection, event mining and network analysis. The SANAR-6 conference will be held at GCHQ 24-26 October 2006.
(S//SI) The conference is open to all fully cleared personnel (TS//SI//TK), but due to logistical constraints, participation is limited to 100 visitors. Priority will be given to those with approved abstracts. To secure your seat at Euro SIGDEV 2006 and Pre-SANAR-6 please submit abstracts via email to Euro SIGDEV Conference organizational committee
(SS) no later than 15 September 2006. Speakers will be confirmed by 22 September 2006 and the finalized agenda will be published by 29 September 2006.
