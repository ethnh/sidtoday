(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities.
(U//FOUO) A brief abstract of the planned presentation is below:
(S//SI) The Sensitive Metadata Analytic Collaboration (SMAC) is a 5-Eyes effort for optimizing the sharing and use of 5-Eyes metadata for enriching SIGINT. The SMAC represents a commitment of the Directors of the 5-Eyes Agencies to support the Alice Springs Resolution on sharing. With a focus on SIGINT metadata of the most sensitive nature, the SMAC will tackle the policy, resource, cultural, and technology issues that hinder the sharing of sensitive metadata. The SMAC has representation from all 5-Eyes and is hosted by NSA's SIGINT Development organization. This session will describe current SMAC activities and explain how analysts can engage SMAC to enhance their analytic effort.
