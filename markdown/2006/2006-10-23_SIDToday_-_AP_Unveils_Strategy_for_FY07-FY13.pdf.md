(U//FOUO) A\&P Unveils Strategy for FY07-FY13
FROM: Carl Johnson
SID's Deputy Director for Analysis \& Production (S2)
Run Date: 10/23/2006
(U//FOUO) Analysis and Production's strategic planning effort has resulted in a Placemat for S2, in keeping with the model set by the SIGINT Directorate's strategic plan .
(U) In our daily lives and at work, the choice is ours: we can drift or we can set out to achieve something great. If we go for greatness, we must decide what we want to accomplish.
(U//FOUO) The same holds true for the Analysis and Production organization. Is A\&P on the right track? Are you on the right course - as an individual, as an employee, as a leader? And just what is the right course anyway? A\&P's strategy for FY07-FY13 is designed to help answer those questions by providing the Analytic Enterprise with the criteria for making day-to-day organizational decisions. It is also intended to serve as a template for evaluating those decisions. Here is a brief outline:
(U//FOUO) A\&P's vision, mission, values, and priorities are closely linked to and aligned with those of the ODNI, NSA, and SID. There is no doubt that we are acting in cooperation within the Enterprise and the Community.
(U//FOUO) Our Strategic Direction is to put analysis first, migrating from "a\&P" to "A\&p". This doesn't mean we are devaluing production. It means we are acknowledging that there are a number of tiers of analysis. Along with this strategic shift, we will increase efforts spent in ensuring the analytic workforce is fully trained and equipped with the right tools, techniques and knowledge to be able to move up and down among those tiers with ease and interpret SIGINT data. This will facilitate drawing analytic conclusions to consistently provide our clients with information of the highest value and to better address the full spectrum of SIGINT information needs expressed by our clients.
(U//FOUO) A\&P's strategic goals set the framework for the actions we must take to achieve our vision:
(U//FOUO) Goal 1, " Deliver high impact analysis against the missions that matter most to our customers ," focuses on the customer, the analytic work force, and the management responsible for ensuring their preparedness and measuring their progress.
(U//FOUO) Goal 2, " Advance analysis through skills, tradecraft, and technology development ," describes the means by which A\&P will achieve its vision - by accelerating and expanding analysts' ability to recognize the relevance and intelligence value of information.
(U//FOUO) Goal 3, "Achieve a collaborative analytic community ," tackles one of the most important issues challenging the Intelligence Community. This goal builds upon the DNI's vision that analysis will increasingly be achieved through integration with partners, foreign intelligence relationships, and non-traditional partners who can provide added value to our analysis.
(U//FOUO) The strategic objectives shown on the Placemat reflect our highest priority actions that we need to take to achieve our goals. We will achieve these objectives by tracking key performance indicators and measuring their results. Our Goal Teams have developed a limited number of measures for each of these objectives and are continuing to refine them. Results will be reported to A\&P leadership at least quarterly. Continual monitoring of our results-focused metrics will enable managers to spot problem areas and act quickly to resolve them.
(U//FOUO) This Plan is the cornerstone of an A\&P integrated performance management system comprising strategic planning, human resources, and business improvement methodologies
supported by technology. With the help of every employee in the Analytic Enterprise, we will further develop the Plan and the management system as necessary to keep A\&P on the right course.
