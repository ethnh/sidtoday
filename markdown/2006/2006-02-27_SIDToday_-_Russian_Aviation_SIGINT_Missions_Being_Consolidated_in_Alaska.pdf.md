(S//SI) Russian Aviation SIGINT Missions Being Consolidated in Alaska

FROM:
Senior Advisor to the DDAP (S2) for Mission Alignment
Run Date: 02/27/2006
(S//SI) The Alaska Mission Operations Center has already taken over Russian Aviation missions from Hawaii and Misawa. Now, further missions will be moved from Digby and Texas and consolidated at the AMOC.
(S//SI) Mission Alignment at the Cryptologic Centers (CCs) is proceeding at an unprecedented pace. But did you know that mission alignment and build-out is also occurring across the Enterprise? It is not limited to just the CCs. An excellent example of build-out at other than a CC is the current consolidation of the Russian Aviation missions at the Alaska Mission Operations Center (AMOC).
(S//SI) Since the consolidation of the Russian missions from NSA/CSS Hawaii and the Misawa Security Operations Center (MSOC) in 2004/2005, the AMOC has had mission responsibility for threat warning on Russian Strategic Aviation, Tactical Aviation, and Air Defense and Naval Air targets in the Pacific Theater. Under the mission alignment concept, the AMOC will also assume full mission responsibility for:

- Russian Strategic Aviation and other Russian military air-related missions for western Russia currently worked at GCHQ's Digby SIGINT Operations Centre (DgSOC) in the UK;
- and for the Russian Tactical Aviation, Military Transport Aviation, and Ground Based Air Defense missions currently worked at NSA/CSS Texas.
(S//SI) The transfer of these missions to the AMOC, along with a more robust collection capability, will fully establish the AMOC as the "center of excellence" for covering all Russian Strategic Aviation, Tactical Aviation, Military Transport Aviation and ground-based Air Defense.
(S//SI) Planning for these moves has been underway for over a year and is now centralized under one Integrated Process Team (IPT) comprised of members from the Office of Russia, the AMOC, our British partners at DgSOC, NSA/CSS Texas, Data Acquisition, the MARSOC PMO, the Analysis and Production Staff, and the Air Intelligence Agency (AIA). At the end of January, the team finalized a 2-year plan depicting the way ahead for both mission transitions.
(S//SI) The DgSOC transition is already underway and is scheduled for completion by 30 June 2006. This mission transition is in full partnership with GCHQ, who along with NSA, will transition manpower (permanent and temporary) with key subject matter expertise to the AMOC to support the mission move. The initial mission transition from NSA/CSS Texas is scheduled to begin in the summer of 2006 and should be completed by 30 June 2007. Military billets from NSA/CSS Texas as well as additional civilian billets will underpin this mission transition to the AMOC.
(S//SI) More good news for the AMOC is that their IT infrastructure is planned for upgrades under project HIGHCASTLE. This infrastructure modernization for voice, analysis and reporting architectures, is scheduled to be installed at the AMOC beginning in July 2006. The HIGHCASTLE architecture is planned to be in place in time to support many of these critical mission transitions further allowing the AMOC to become the primary strategic warning node for Russian Aviation for the US and our Allies.
