(U//FOUO) On the Upcoming SCOR Conference, and My Tour as SIGINT Director

FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 03/28/2006
(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Director discusses the Site Commanders Operational Review and his extension as SIGINT Director until October.
(U//FOUO) I want to take a minute to tell you about the upcoming Site Commanders Operational Review (SCOR) Conference, which will be held from 5 to 6 April. Starting with 2006, we will hold the SCORs semi-annually. This will be our third SCOR Conference in which we've sought to advance the state of our global enterprise. We will bring the chiefs of our largest sites together specifically to identify net-centric solutions to our most challenging mission gaps.
(U//FOUO) As I've discussed with you before, our path to success in this 21st century is a globally distributed enterprise that treats each cryptologic professional as the national treasure that he or she is. Getting to that point means letting people make enlightened decisions about which missions and tasks they are taking on. These decisions must be made in a collaborative, communal way.
(U//FOUO) We use the SCOR as an opportunity to model such enlightened, collaborative decision-making at the site commander level. If we at the commander's level can figure this out, then certainly younger, brighter people below us can do the same. So, for two days we'll review our progress in net-centric governance, we'll chart out the next tough objective, and - most important - we'll figure out how to turn our areas of poor or limited performance (called "reds" and "oranges" in our mission assessment process*) into good or fair performance ("green" or "yellow").
(U//FOUO) I believe the next step in improving our process is improving how we hold ourselves accountable for the "gray areas" - those self-identified missions falling outside the Director's Strategic Mission List**. We all suspect that it's in the gray areas that new missions will form and important discoveries will be made. The SIGINT leadership does not want to stifle these kinds of initiative; but on the other hand, we must hold ourselves accountable for all of the missions we are performing and must ensure we are putting enough emphasis on the Director's Strategic Mission List.
(U//FOUO) We'll report out to you after the SCOR Conference about what we've learned about the gray areas. Like us, you must constantly reassess the tasks and missions you perform daily. In the end, it will take all of us to ensure that SIGINT is always providing the best possible value to the nation. I, for one, see it as a sign of progress that we can now carry on this level of conversation, because as recently as a few years ago we were not yet sophisticated enough in our procedures to do so.
(U//FOUO) What does this mean to you? I encourage you to consider how your work fits into the big picture of SIGINT support to the nation. Are we doing what the nation needs most? As target experts, share your thoughts with management on how to make our SIGINT even more relevant - that's how we'll continue to grow stronger.
(U//FOUO) Lastly, I recently got word that my tour as SIGINT Director has been extended until 1 October 2006. I asked to be extended so that there will be an overlap between my departure and the arrival of my replacement, who probably will not arrive until early fall. We have a great deal of wonderful things happening in the SIGINT System, and I wouldn't want any of that fine work to lag due to the absence of a SIGINT Director. I appreciate that LTG Alexander and my wife (not necessarily in that order!) have approved my request.
