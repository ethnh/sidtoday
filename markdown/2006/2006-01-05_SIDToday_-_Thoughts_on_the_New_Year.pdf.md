(U) Thoughts on the New Year

FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 01/05/2006
(U) Welcome back to those of you who managed to take some time off for the holidays - and I hope that includes all of you! We face an exciting, challenging year ahead, one I truly look forward to.
(U//FOUO) Over the last four years of this assignment, every day has been an exciting one, and I never went home wondering whether I'd done something for the country. I hope you can say the same. We continue to prosecute the Global War on Terrorism even as many other obligations demand our attention, and ultimately the attention of our nation. There is never enough time, never enough resources. The puzzles are impossibly complex... and that's why we love it.
(U) As we embark on 2006, I thought I'd share with you my thoughts on the year ahead and the goals I hope we can achieve. First and foremost comes the prosecution of our mission - and this we will achieve, as we always have. I feel very comfortable about the high quality of our work.
(U//FOUO) In my "to-do" box, my hope for this year is that we continue on the path of Transformation that we've followed for six years now, making just the right adjustments to the visions laid out by our new Director, LTG Alexander. He is building on the successes of the past and leading us to an even more capable future.
(S//SI) Specifically, for my part, there's a lot of unfinished business I hope we can close out before I retire this summer:

- I'd like to see us continue to develop into a net-centric enterprise, and to get the right tools in place to make that a reality.
- We must formalize our Governance processes so that more of us understand the roles we play, and more of us are connected to the NSA Director's intent, as we decide what is important on any given day.
- I want to take the next step in unifying the US SIGINT System and the US Cryptologic System by tying the military services even more closely to NSA. Steps being taken by the Central Security Service at the corporate level -- whereby they'll become a truly viable staff for military integration -- will help drive this along. SID's Global Cryptologic Integration Center (GCIC), a forum in which SID and the military services will organize, train and equip as a unified system, will also be a big factor.
- My final goal is to continue to develop SIGINT leadership in the generations that follow and continue to ensure a well-trained and diverse work force, both civilian and military.
(U) It has been an honor for me over the last four years to serve you and to serve with you, and I greatly look forward to our time ahead together. God bless.
