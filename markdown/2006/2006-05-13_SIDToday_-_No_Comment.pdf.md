Chief, S2 SIGINT Assessment Cell (S20B)

(U//FOUO) How do SIGINTers measure success? Delivering the mission? Making customers happy? Protecting the warfighter? When we are asked for hard numbers, we usually provide some measure of the intelligence reports we generate. Is intelligence just the facts? Is it the facts blended with our expertise? Or is it some combination of both?
(U//FOUO) In today's climate, protecting the nation requires us to share the facts as well as insights. "Putting what is between the analysts ears" on paper is an area of emphasis for senior leaders. One of the benchmarks of progress is the content of the COMMENTS field of a regular report.
(U/FOUO) As noted in Carl Johnson's SID today article, I recently conducted a review of SIGINT reports from across the enterprise to assess how well we are sharing insight.
(U//FOUO) Would you believe that in 2005, approximately $75 \%$ of our serialized reports went out without any intelligence other than the fact? Of course, this means that $25 \%$ of the reports did have a COMMENT. And, more interestingly - only about $12 \%$ of the reports issued last year had COMMENTs that could be described as adding any significant insight, or interpretation to the data.
(U//FOUO) Of those that had a COMMENT flag:

- $3 \%$ of the total sample had comments with assessments, predictions, judgments, or forecasts (including those reports that had such characteristics outside of a COMMENT such as SIGINT Assessment Reports)
- $8.6 \%$ of the total sample had COMMENTs that went beyond description and explanation of SIGINT fact
- $10 \%$ of the total sample had comments that added some insight or context, but were essentially explanatory or descriptive
- The remaining $3.4 \%$, contained things like text clarification, introduction to collateral, and introduction to previously reported SIGINT and other information.
(U) See below for details on the categories used in this study.
(U//FOUO) Insights are based on facts and or analytic expertise. Insights can be short and written in the COMMENTS paragraph or sentence of SIGINT report or they can be a more formal, stand alone, and possibly longer report. Sharing insights and perspective is a relatively painless way to develop the "so what?" aspect of any report, or even provide your assessment of the information. A report does not have to be labeled as a SIGINT Assessment Report to be considered assessment reporting.
(U//FOUO) In my current role, I am charged with increasing the insights along with the facts in our reporting. My measure of success is increasing the formal reporting of those insights to the customer. I want to better understand what is driving these numbers - please use the blog to provide some perspective.
(U//FOUO) Why are so few insights shared?
Is it lack of time? Pressure to get more reports out?
Are they shared in different formats? If so, how often?
Please share your perspective:
(U//FOUO) Study Details:
We used a random, but statistically relevant, sample of reports and developed 8 categories of COMMENTs used in the report:

1. Text clarification
2. Introduce collateral
3. Introduce previously reported SIGINT
4. Add some degree of insight or context, but not reaching the level of interpreting SIGINT fact: still explaining or describing
5. Interpreting SIGINT Fact
6. Assessment
7. Other
8. Reports that had interpretation/assessment outside of a COMMENT
