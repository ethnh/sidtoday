(U) The article (U) Acronyms Anonymous touched on the benefits of using short, simple words over longer ones. This reminded a few readers of a noteworthy NSA memo from many years ago. The memo was issued by NSA's Assistant Director for Production, Maj Gen John E. Morrison, USAF (pictured) on 28 December 1971, and read in its entirety:

Subject: Utilization
Please stop utilizing "utilize" and utilize "use."
$\qquad$

Maj Gen Morrison

# (U) Thanks to the Center for Cryptologic History for providing a copy of this memo. See also a bio of Maj Gen Morrison .
