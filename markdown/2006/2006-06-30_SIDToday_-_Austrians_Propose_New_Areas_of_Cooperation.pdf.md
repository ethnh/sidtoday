(TS//SI) Austrians visit NSA; proliferation, terrorism, and Middle East top agenda.
(TS//SI) In late March 2006, senior personnel from the Austrian Army Intelligence Service's (HNaA) Analysis Department visited NSA to discuss expansion of cooperation between our organizations.
(TS//SI) The Directors of the Analysis Department's Middle East, Proliferation, and Balkans divisions accompanied Delegation Lead Brigadier General Gunther Eisl, and presented detailed briefings on their respective areas. Brigadier General Eisl also provided information from their Terrorism Division (whose director was unable to attend).
(TS//SI) This visit represented our first foray into the proliferation, terrorism, and Middle East areas with the Austrians (cooperation has historically focused on Russia and the Balkans). During the day of briefings and dialogue, it became clear that NSA could benefit from Austria's expertise and reporting on these topics. Work is currently underway to identify specific areas for cooperation on new targets of mutual interest.
