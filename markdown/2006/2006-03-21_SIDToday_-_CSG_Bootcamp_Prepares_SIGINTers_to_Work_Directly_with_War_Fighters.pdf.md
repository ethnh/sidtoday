(C) Since its debut in October 2005, CSG Bootcamp has been a resounding success. This extensive training program was developed to ensure that NSA personnel assigned to Cryptologic Services Groups worldwide were prepared to provide SIGINT support to their clients, particularly the war fighter and battlefield commanders.
(U//FOUO) Initially conceived at the 2004 Worldwide CSG Chief's Conference at NSAW, CSG Bootcamp was designed as a comprehensive training program for junior personnel assigned to CSGs. In an effort to increase knowledge and client interaction with the SIGINT system, Customer Gateway (S11) and CSG Support (S1132) teamed with the National Cryptologic School (NCS) and EDS contractors to develop a training program that focused on the SIGINT process, and, specifically, how this process relates to CSG personnel.
(U//FOUO) Over a two-year period, CSG Training Program personnel conducted an exhaustive assessment, gathering input from every CSG, to determine what training was needed. Following the assessment and a Job Task Survey, CSG Support and EDS contractors began to develop the course curriculum and implement a process for coordinating the logistical issues and support services required to host the Bootcamp.
(C) Designated CRSK-1200 after it received NCS accreditation, CSG Bootcamp is facilitated at NSAW by Customer Gateway's CSG Training Chief, CTR1 $\square$ with coordination support provided by CTR2 Shanna Lloyd. The two-week course offers students training in several areas, including:

- NSA/CSS and organizational overviews,
- customer account management,
- SIGINT reporting and sanitization,
- technologies,
- NSOC (National Security Operations Center),
- ArcView,
- NSRP (National SIGINT Requirements Process) and
- Key Reads.

Presenters include LTG Keith B. Alexander, Director NSA/CSS, MG Richard J. Quirk, SIGINT Director, RDML Tony L. Cothron, Deputy Director for Customer Relationships, and $\square$ Chief, Customer Gateway.
(U/FOUO) Customer Gateway invited personnel from CSGs across the globe to participate in the pilot offering of CSG Bootcamp. The 27 initial participants included five senior CSG personnel, who evaluated the course curriculum and made recommendations for additional training and future offerings. The course was revised, and a second Bootcamp took place in February 2006. MSgt $\square$ from CSG SOUTHCOM was invited to NSAW for the February offering. He was able to provide a CSG'ers perspective on how information should be presented to the students, as well as how it can be applied once they return to their respective CSGs.
(U/FOUO) To date, 45 personnel from 19 CSGs have attended the Bootcamp. Class sizes are between 15 and 20, and students should have no more than four months experience at their current CSG prior to attending.
(U/FOUO) The CRSK-1200 course description and upcoming class dates can be found in the NCS catalog, or by contacting the curriculum steward, Mr. $\square$ at NSTS $\square$. The next scheduled offering is May 2006.
