(U//FOUO) Presenting the latest quarterly update from NSA/CSS Hawaii...
(S//SI) While the rest of the world waited in great anticipation for the first test flight of the North Korean Taepodong II (TD-2) ICBM/SLV*, the NSA/CSS Hawaii Signals Intelligence Directorate (HSID) was in the know. As part of an immense nationally coordinated effort, HSID was proud to contribute collection, analysis and reporting from the first crisis indications to the actual missile launch.
(S//SI) The HSID North Korea Military Operations Department (HS2B4) successfully established a round-the-clock Missile Crisis Cell jointly manned by senior civilian and military analysts as the launches became imminent. Mr. the department's senior missile expert, stated, "We developed and provided daily updates to a SIGINT-based missile cycle time-line incorporating historical data from 1991, 1993, 1998, and 2004 missile activity." Based on historical data, target country knowledge, and key indicators, he and other analysts were able to help the Intelligence Community calculate windows of predictability for the actual launches.
(S//SI) NSA-H analysts fused multi-source data, collecting all available communications. According to a senior watch analyst, "Available communications consisted of manual Morse and communications checks by range-clearance vessels." This data confirmed the involvement of the two North Korean vessels and enabled NSA-H and other SIGINT producers to database these vessels for possible involvement in future launches.
(S//SI) At 1833Z** and 1904Z on 4 July 2006, one SCUD-class Short-Range Ballistic Missile (SRBM) and one NODONG-class SRBM respectively launched out of Kittaeryong, North Korea into the closure area. Approximately 90 seconds later, the TD-2's maiden test flight launched. Moments after take-off the missile exploded leaving no indications of its final destination.
(U//FOUO) Establishment of the Missile Crisis Cell, external coordination and extensive knowledge of our experts provided quick-action preparedness and results. The launch of the TD2 left us poised and ready with more capabilities to handle future threats.
