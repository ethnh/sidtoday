# Course Overview: 

(U//FOUO) Coming out of its June Summit, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has seen a fair amount of press. The SCO was founded in 2001 by Russia, China and four former Soviet republics in Central Asia. Observers now include Iran, India, Pakistan and Mongolia. Originally centered on mutual concerns for state security, the SCO has the potential to become a major center of gravity politically and economically.
(U//FOUO) Whether it will become "as Asian counterpart to NATO" as expressed by Chinese President Hu Jintao, or "a new model of geopolitical integration ... without any claims to monopoly or domination," as uttered by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, it is worth exploring what this SCO is, what it isn't, and what may lie ahead. Join us on September 20 for a joint presentation by the SINIOs for East Asia, Russia, and Economics and Global Issues.
(U//FOUO) To register, and for further info on this series of seminars, please consult the SINIO Brown Bag Seminars Website. Any questions or concerns regarding registration should be directed to the NCS.
