(TS//SI//REL) Collection Breakthrough Gives Added Hope for Hostage Rescue in Colombia

FROM: ICN Elements at NSA Texas and at Fort Meade

(TS//SI//REL) New access to communications of Colombian terrorist insider may possibly lead to actionable intelligence.
(TS//SI//REL) This September, years of effort by multiple NSA organizations to access Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) leadership communications came to fruition when analysts issued the first report based on email communications of FARC Secretariat member Raul Reyes.
(TS//SI//REL) According to HUMINT, Mr. Reyes knows the status and whereabouts of three U.S. hostages who were taken hostage by the FARC -- a Tier 1 terrorist group -- in February 2003 and who have been held ever since. This breakthrough comes at a fortuitous time for the U.S. Intelligence Community as USSOUTHCOM has an ongoing operation (Operation Willing Spirit) to find and rescue the U.S. hostages.

(TS//SI//REL) The FARC leadership reporting, issued by analysts from International Crime and Narcotics (ICN) shops at Fort Meade and at NSA/CSS Texas, is derived from FBI Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act collection. More recent reports from this source have indicated that the hostages are likely still alive, and showed that the FARC was hopeful that the U.S. would agree to a prisoner swap for FARC members extradited to the U.S.
(TS//SI//REL) NSA-W and NSA-T target development analysts -- realizing that this is just one small window into the FARC -- continue their work to broaden SIGINT access to the FARC Secretariat. However, they remain hopeful that continued access to this level of data may lead to current, unique information on the hostages.
