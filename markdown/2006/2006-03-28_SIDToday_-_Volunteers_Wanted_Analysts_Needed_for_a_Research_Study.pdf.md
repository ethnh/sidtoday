FROM:
RAD's Knowledge Discovery Sciences Office (R62)
Run Date: 03/28/2006
(U//FOUO) R62 (Knowledge Discovery Sciences) is conducting a user study on wiki collaboration tools in late March/April 2006. At least 24 analysts are needed to participate.
(U//FOUO) R62 would need each analyst for approximately two hours in either FMHQ or OPS1. The study compares the ease of use of three types of wikis, and participants are welcomed from the novice to experienced level in using these tools. You will be asked to speak openly, answer interview questions, and complete a survey. This study is a test of the wikis, not you.
(U) Please contact
