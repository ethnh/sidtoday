(S//SI) The Special Operations Command Forms New Task Force to Find Terrorists

FROM:
NSA Rep to SOCOM CSO (F1T)
Run Date: 06/29/2006
(U//FOUO) SOCOM and reps from across the Intelligence Community work side-by-side to take a global look at terrorism.
(U//FOUO) NCR* U. S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) continues to re-align itself to support one of NSA's more enigmatic customers. Recently, SOCOM completed construction on a new facility, the War-Fighting Center. This center houses mostly the Center for Special Operations (CSO), which contains the SOCOM Intelligence, Operations, and Planning Directorates. This new facility also houses the newest addition to USSOCOM, the Inter-Agency Task Force, or IATF.
(S//SI) What is an IATF? The IATF combines the talents of Operations (J3), Intelligence (J2) and Inter-Agency (IA) personnel. Among the Inter-Agency partners are NSA, CIA, DIA, NGA, FBI, Treasury, and State Department employees or contractors. This diverse group works together to look at the Global Terrorism Network and provide fidelity on individuals, groups, or areas that support or are havens for terrorists. The IATF avoids, as best they can, duplicating efforts of other Commands or Task Forces, realizing that coordination with other Combatant Commands and de-confliction of efforts is essential to the SOCOM mission of synchronizing the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).
(S//SI) The IATF is all about opportunities, finding potential targets and coordinating with the various Commands to develop appropriate courses of action (COAs). These COAs could be capture/kill, maintain status quo, or freezing assets; in fact, they run the entire gamut of options. These options would probably not be acted on by SOCOM but rather passed to appropriate Commands for action. NCR USSOCOM has provided two individuals to support this effort, a senior analyst, capable of reach back to NSAW or the extended enterprise for the latest SIGINT insight/capabilities against the targets, and a metadata analyst to provide day-to-day interaction with the IATF.
(S//SI) Although a fledgling effort, the IATF has already developed a picture of the East Africa al-Qa'ida Cell in Somalia and has briefed this to the Central Command J3 for them to pursue. They have also worked with the European Command on GSPC* targets in the Trans-Sahel region of the Algerian and Mali border area, and are looking at opportunities in the Southern Command area of responsibility.
(S//SI) Additionally, SOCOM conducts regular VTCs with the JIATFs* and other partners to discuss potential targets of opportunity. NCR/CSG* analysts have worked with the CT MMC* at NSA to tell them of the latest IATF targets of interest and to verify NSA data to support or, in some cases, alter the IATF planning cycle. SOCOM , through the IATF and with the assistance of their Inter-Agency partners, is truly looking at the War on Terrorism in a global manner, utilizing all-source intelligence to put potential targets under the microscope.
(S) NCR SOCOM is a key part of this effort and adds an integral piece to the toolkit used to find, fix, and finish terrorists, wherever they hide.
(U) USSOCOM is headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base, in Tampa, Florida. Pictured: downtown Tampa.
