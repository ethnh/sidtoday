(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) hosted the annual 5-Eyes SIGINT Development conference from 5 to 9 June 2006 at NSAW, incorporating the Signals Analysis Development Conference (SADC) as a major thread. With over 1350 delegates from around the world (including 125 Second Party delegates) choosing from over 200 briefings, round-table discussions, demonstrations, tours and training workshops, this is believed to be the largest NSA event ever held. Conference organizers hosted events in six different conference rooms simultaneously throughout the week. The conference proved to be a great venue to share successes, issues and ideas, and to promote collaboration among peers from across the globe.
(U//FOUO) If you were unable to attend the conference, you can still benefit by viewing most of the PowerPoint presentations or watching the videos from the conference's most popular events right at your desktop! In addition to the many topic-focused videos, you'll also be able to view DIRNSA's opening remarks, the keynote address from Dr. Michael Wertheimer (ODNI), and a joint presentation from the 5-Eyes SIGDEV Heads.
