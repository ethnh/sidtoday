(U//FOUO) UPDATE (as of 1 October, 2006): TARANTELLA training was discontinued as of 9/30/06.
(U//FOUO) Switching from Unix to Windows XP? Training is available to help make the transition.
(U//FOUO) The SID Desktop Modernization Team is leading the extremely tough task of converting approximately 6,050 Sun/Solaris desktops to the enterprise-endorsed Windowsbased desktop. The SID desktop modernization program is the CIO -mandated effort to replace all SID EA-barcoded Top Secret Unix workstations with the Windows XP desktop, while still maintaining the capability to run the legacy Unix applications needed to carry out the SID mission.
(U//FOUO) These numerous Sun/Solaris-based applications will be displayed back via middleware formerly called "Tarantella" and now known as "Secure Global Desktop." For more SID Desktop Modernization (SDM) program background information, please refer to the SDM web page ("go sdm").
(U//FOUO) The major difference for the users during this desktop migration transition will be the change in the workflow process. To help them adjust to the new desktop, Windows/Tarantella classes are currently being offered. There are two types of classes:

1. Pointers Class -- lasts one day (three hours) and briefly covers the Outlook e-mail tool, the WebTop and its working components.
2. Full-Needs Class -- lasts 2 days (eight hours) and provides an overview of the Windows XP operating system, to include a brief discussion of the operating system, creating shortcuts, file management, and training on the use of Outlook (reading/creating email messages, creating signature blocks and customizing features).
(U//FOUO) These classes are being offered to current and future users within SID. The class schedule is available at the Eagle Alliance web portal (type "go atsc") and clicking on the Tarantella tab (or click here
