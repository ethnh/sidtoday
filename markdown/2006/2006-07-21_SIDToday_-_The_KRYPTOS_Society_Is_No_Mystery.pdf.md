(U) The KRYPTOS Society Is No Mystery

FROM:
KRYPTOS President
Run Date: 07/21/2006
(U) What is KRYPTOS?
(U) The KRYPTOS Society was established in 1981 to promote interest in cryptanalysis, to provide a focal point for the fields of common interest to cryptanalysts of the National Security Agency, and to promote excellence in the cryptologic community. It has since expanded with chapters at GCHQ (UK), CSE (Canada) and DSD (Australia), which has members from GCSB (NZ) as well. Although NSA's KRYPTOS has an elected council of 8 members from the community, it cannot function without volunteers from among the rest of the approximately 250 members.
(U) What does KRYPTOS do?
(U) First, KRYPTOS sponsors several technical talks throughout the year. These talks are given by members of the wider cryptanalysis community and are hopefully of interest to cryptanalysts, and are usually open to all cleared employees.
(U) KRYPTOS also sponsors a Cryptanalyst of the Quarter award. KRYPTOS members can nominate anyone for a significant, but perhaps unheralded, cryptanalysis achievement in the previous 6 months. The recipient is awarded a gold coffee mug with the KRYPTOS logo.
(U) On the social front, KRYPTOS sponsors a family night during the summer months at a Bowie Baysox baseball game.
(U) Each year KRYPTOS recognizes cryptanalytic excellence at a luncheon traditionally held at the Fort Meade Officer's Club.
Awards are bestowed for a variety of activities:

- The Cryptanalytic Literature Competition is for papers written on topics clearly relating to cryptanalysis.
- The Technical Talk (on video) competition recognizes the best technical presentation on cryptanalysis or one of its related disciplines. An international panel of judges decides what papers and talks are awarded (cash prizes).
- The Norman Roberts Award, also juried by an international board, is sponsored by the Cheltenham Chapter to recognize outstanding contributions by a junior analyst.
- The Distinguished Member award(s) honor retired individuals for their lifetime contributions to the fields of Cryptanalysts and Crypt-related disciplines.
- The Peter Jenks Community Service Award is awarded for outstanding community service and is open to NSA KRYPTOS members only.
