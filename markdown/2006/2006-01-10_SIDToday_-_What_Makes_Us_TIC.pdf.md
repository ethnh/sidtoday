(U) What Makes Us TIC?
FROM: and
Telecommunications Information Center (TIC - S202A2)
Run Date: 01/10/2006
(U//FOUO) If you use ANCHORY you may have encountered a few reports that begin "Available in the NSA TIC . . ." but how much do you know about the Telecommunications Information Center (TIC)? The mission of Advanced Intelligence Research Services' TIC is to provide the most current classified and unclassified telecommunications-related information to the analytic workforce. TIC personnel acquire, manage, advertise and distribute within NSA classified telecommunications-related enclosures to intelligence telecommunications reports. Some NSA analysts have become "regulars" to this office over the years. But do you know what else is available in the NSA TIC?
(U//FOUO) Besides being the primary office for managing classified telecommunications-related enclosures, the TIC is also home to the Army INSCOM Technical Equipment Library (TEL), a collection of over 220,000 telecommunications-related documents. The TEL contains equipment documentation, vendor and/or service provider brochures, and technical conference/research papers. Some of the items contained in this unique collection date back to the 1940's. Customers may request information from the TEL on-line via the TIC web site (enter "go tic" or 000000000000000000000000000000 in your browser window then scroll down to the "INSCOM's Technical Equipment Library" hyperlink).
(U//FOUO) The TIC web site also contains an extensive collection of on-line telecommunications resources. A link entitled "ITU Resources" provides access to International Telecommunications Union (ITU) recommendations and operation bulletins. Newsletters, research papers, and market analysis reports from over 17 commercial vendors are included in the "Licensed Resources" section. Selected documents from this collection are organized by technology under the "Telecommunications Technologies Subject List" (TTSL).
(U//FOUO) The TTSL pages were recently redesigned to make them more user-friendly by adding sub-headings and alphabetizing the contents. New pages added in 2005 include "VoIP," "3G," and "Regional News." The latter, created specifically with NSA analysts Enterprise-wide in mind, contains information about worldwide telecommunications markets and are organized as follows:

- Asia/Pacific;
- Europe and Russia;
- Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and
- Middle East and Africa.
(U//FOUO) Whether you're a long time user of the TIC's resources or a new analyst still learning the ropes, we encourage you to visit our web site ("go tic") and explore what the TIC has to offer, or visit us in OPS1, Room 1S040. Requests and comments are always welcome by contacting us at $\square$ or by calling $\square$
