(U) Town Meeting Sets Future DA Tempo

FROM: Diana Keys
Deputy Chief of Staff for Data Acquisition (S3)
Run Date: 03/28/2006
(U//FOUO) Recent changes in SID leadership created a cascade of personnel changes in Data Acquisition, including the appointment of Rick Ledgett as Acting Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (DA) and as Acting Assistant Deputy Director for Data Acquisition. Their view for the future of DA was the topic of a February Town Meeting. Mr. Ledgett's opening remarks emphasized the importance of DA, not only to SIGINT and the Intelligence Community, but also to the safety of the nation itself.
(TS//SI) In support of this critical role, DA, along with many other organizations throughout NSA, will be focusing much of its efforts on the development of the next generation mission environment system, TURBULENCE. An umbrella program that covers the next generation of active and passive collection systems and the common structure that underlies both, TURBULENCE represents a radical change that will greatly affect DA activities.
(U//FOUO) A similar sea change occurs in the budget area with the move from the existing 22 expenditutre centers to 11 funding lanes, organized around the "Big Four" issues: Information Technology, Acquire Information, Analysis and Production, and Client Response. This approach employs a three-part strategy: define the vision, determine what we are doing to get there, and direct the resources to those activities that are critical to this vision. Consequently, hard choices will be made about what programs need to be de-emphasized and, accordingly, how our people resources can be best utilized. (See related DIRgram.).
(U//FOUO) Guidance and timelines for the 2006 Civilian Promotion Process were also outlined. Finally, Mr. Ledgett addressed some of the questions previously posed by S3 employees through the S3 website. The questions and answers can be found on S3's home page.
(U//FOUO) A two-day off-site with S3 leadership followed the Town Meeting. The focus of this meeting was to revisit the DA mission, vision, values, and strategic goals. Employees will be asked to provide feedback on these definitions and then to help achieve the vision, conduct the mission, live the values, and meet the goals. Details from the off-site will be the subject of a future article. Stay tuned.
