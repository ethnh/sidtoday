(U//FOUO) Registration Opens for a Panel Discussion on Homeland Security

FROM: NCR Department of Homeland Security Unknown
Run Date: 12/14/2006

What: Panel discussion on homeland security, with representatives from all Second Party countries
When: 8 January from 1:00-3:00
Where: R\&E Auditorium
(U) Advance registration is required; see below for instructions.
(U//FOUO) The homeland security component of the Global War on Terrorism, like all aspects of GWOT, requires broad cooperation among all of our allies, specifically our most trusted partners -- the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. On a daily basis, we collaboratively work with these partners to uncover threats to our homelands and to secure our respective borders. Five years since 9/11, however, we still do not fully understand how our partners define homeland security, and how all of our various authorities and structures permit -- or inhibit-- different actions.
(U//FOUO) Please join us in the R\&E Auditorium, or via VTC from field locations, on 8 January from 1:00-3:00, to listen to and participate in discussions on homeland security within and amongst the US and our partners. NSA's Homeland Security Support Office/Office of the NSA/CSS Representative to the Department of Homeland Security (NCR DHS) will chair a panel consisting of representatives from the UK's GCHQ, Australia's DSD, Canada's CSE, and New Zealand's, GCSB to present and discuss the many issues dealing with homeland security.

# (U) The Agenda 

(U//FOUO) The session will begin with a panel of representatives from each of our five nations discussing how homeland security is addressed in each country. Each nation's presentation will:

- define homeland security;
- describe who in their government is responsible for homeland security;
- outline the intelligence-sharing policies within their government and to their counterpart agencies in other countries; and
- describe the laws and policies that govern how SIGINT can be shared with law enforcement entities.
(U//FOUO) The panel will be followed by an open question-and-answer session. This session will provide a rare opportunity for analysts and agency leaders alike to discover ways to understand each other's authorities, limitations and restrictions, and to open new avenues for information sharing.
