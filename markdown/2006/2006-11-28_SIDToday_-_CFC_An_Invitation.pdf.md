(U) CFC: An Invitation

FROM: Wendy Allen
SID CFC Keyworker
Run Date: 11/28/2006
(U) You are all invited -- to make a positive difference in someone else's life and extend a helping hand to those in need by contributing to the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC). As the CFC enters its final week, I would like to thank all of you who have given so generously. NSA is close to meeting its goal of $\$ 1.9$ million. As of last Friday, pledges reached the $\$ 1.78$ million mark, a remarkable achievement.
(U) It's not too late for those of you still considering making a contribution to participate. Just $\$ 1.00$ a pay period will help us meet our goal and increase our participation rate. Anyone making a pledge by 30 November will automatically be entered into a random drawing. The winner will receive a $\square$ print of the Pride of Baltimore II. There will also be another CFC Craft Fair on 28 November from 1100-1300 in the FANX III cafeteria.
(U) As we enter the holiday season, please consider donating to the CFC and making the world just a little brighter for those less fortunate.
(U) For information on how to contribute, visit the CFC web site ("go cfc").
(U) Many thanks to all for your continued support.
