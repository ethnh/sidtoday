(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities. A brief abstract of the planned presentation is below:
(S//SI//REL) BLACKPEARL is a survey tool developed in the Network Analysis Center to help characterize transmission links and the networks present on them. Currently, its most robust features provide a characterization of IP networks in a small number of packets, often around 10,000 packets. This brown bag will walk through usage of BLACKPEARL to help identify best points of access within the SIGINT system to collect on a target IP network.
