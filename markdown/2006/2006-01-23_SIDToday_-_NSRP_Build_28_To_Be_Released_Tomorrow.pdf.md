(U//FOUO) NSRP Build 2.8 To Be Released Tomorrow
FROM: and
Information Needs and Outcomes (S1111)
Run Date: 01/23/2006
(U//FOUO) Upgrade designed to improve the Information Needs process...
(U//FOUO) On January 24, 2006, The National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) Build 2.8 will be released. What's different and new, you ask? Many of the changes that you have been asking for!
(U//FOUO) A completely new Research IN tool and its associated processes have been incorporated into the NSRP. This new tool will encompass the entire Research IN* process. Specific changes include assignment of Research INs to multiple Product Lines at once, generation of a response plan upon acceptance of the need, and tracking/publication of the responses via the National Producer Interface (NPI) Tool. Research INs will have their own status board in the NPI Tool, separating them from the standing and limited duration INs.
(U//FOUO) Additionally, Research INs will automatically close thirty days after the final response is published. This change will eliminate the integration and dependence on the Research IN Responder Tool (RRT) that is currently in use. (Fewer tools!) All legacy research response data will still be available via the NSRP web site and any non-closed Research INs will automatically be converted to the new structure once version 2.8 is released.
(U//FOUO) Other changes include...

# Shaping Client Expectations: 

- (U//FOUO) Build 2.8 provides the long-anticipated ability to detail NSA/CSS capabilities at the EEI Level which external customers find critical to making operations decisions.
- (U//FOUO) A 16th standardized statement has been added, allowing for improved binning of paragraph responses.


## Analyst-Friendly Features:

- (U//FOUO) Table of Contents with additional links to related INs.
- (U//FOUO) IN Title relocated to the top of the page.
- (U//FOUO) Improved details on before and after priorities for all Global Updates - used most commonly for the integration of the National Intelligence Priority Framework matrix.
(U//FOUO) These are just some of the new features for NSRP 2.8. Please visit the NSRP website for a complete list of changes. Due to the extensive improvements in Build 2.8, training will be mandatory for all NPI Client Users. Please go to the events webpage to register for training.
(U) Extended Enterprise Training:
(U//FOUO) NSRP Build 2.8 Training for the extended enterprise will be conducted via VTC*. S1111 is scheduling a pilot project with NSA/CSS TX for February. If the training goes well and is understandable via VTC, then S1111 will be coordinating with the S11 extended enterprise points of contact (POCs) to schedule their training. If the VTC is not the appropriate way to conduct this training, S1111 will then contact the appropriate POCs to work out what type of training is the most effective.
*(U) Note:
IN = Information Need
VTC = Video Teleconferencing
