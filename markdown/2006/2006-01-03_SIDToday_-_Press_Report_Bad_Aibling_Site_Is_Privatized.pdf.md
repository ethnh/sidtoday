(U//FOUO) The one-time Bad Aibling Station U.S. SIGINT site has been "mostly" sold to private developers. According to the newspaper Mangfall-Bote, the German Government concluded a deal on November 9, 2005 to transfer ownership of the property to the B\&O Group of Munich, an apartment services company. B\&O paid over 3 million Euros (approximately $\$ 3.6$ million) for about 70 hectares ( 148 acres). The newspaper reported that a 60 -hectare parcel was kept separate, and remains the property of the German Federal Government.
(U) The new owners reportedly do not plan to demolish the existing buildings, but rather will incorporate them into an overall redevelopment of the property. B\&O "is already looking for people for a call center to be set up there," the newspaper quoted a federal official as saying. The call center is to be set up in the office building next to the fire department on the former U.S. property.
(U) In addition, the company plans to establish a central workshop on the site, for maintenance of its many residential properties in the region. It also reportedly intends to set up a training center for company personnel in the former casino area (Officers' Club).
(U) A rival investor proposed to develop the property as an 800-bed 5 -star hotel, but this losing bid was deemed "unrealistic."
(U//FOUO) Bad Aibling Station shut down in April 2004 after 52 years of operation. See a related article from NSA Daily about the closure of BA.
