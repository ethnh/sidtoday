(U//FOUO) Interns Now Contributing from Day One
FROM: $\square$
Intelligence Analysis Intern
Run Date: 04/07/2006
(U//FOUO) Maybe it has been a few years since you EOD'd to the Agency (the one North of DC). Maybe you have forgotten the uncertainty that surrounds the interview process when questions like "So, what will I be doing?" are met with "I can't tell you, just trust me, take a leap of faith, move your family, start a new life, buy a house you can't afford, and get out of your comfort zone...it will be just fine." So, like so many before me and at the tender age of 31, I embarked on a new career in the Top Secret world of intelligence.
(U//FOUO) An applicant's mind can swirl with thoughts of what the job will entail once when we actually start ( 6 to 24 months later). Will it be more like

Dilbert or Star Wars? Will I reprogram satellites in my lunch hour or will I spend all day dividing paper into neat stacks? I finally decided that my first year and a half (of my three-year program) would be spent mostly training and learning a language and that I would not really get started until my second year.
(U//FOUO) Yeah right! Instead, I found myself right in the thick of things from day one.
(C) The reality is that members of the Intelligence Analysis Development Program are increasingly becoming significant contributors to offices within the National Security Agency. As the volume of traffic increases and as more and more countries gain technologies, IADP members are being asked to alleviate the load of analysis and reporting that is needed. Perhaps in the past, IADP members were able to use their first year and a half to focus on training and learning from mentors, but, today, we are needed to aide in prosecuting critical targets within weeks of arriving.

That First Tour (U):
(TS) So, there I was... 10 years since I had touched a biology book. My undergraduate degree was in biology, but I had worked in computers ever since. So, of course, my first tour was in Combating Proliferation (S2G13 - Current Intel), working the al-Qa'ida anthrax program. Not quite satellites, but not really Dilbert either.
(TS) The next six months were eventful to say the least. The world of CP-CT (Counterterrorism) is high tempo as we engaged in "looking for a needle in a stack of needles." It is not enough to identify someone as a bad guy, but rather identify the ones that are engaging in actively pursuing WMDs. CP-CT has been described as the nexus where the worst people get the worst weapons.
(TS) During that time I was able to collaborate with other partners within the IC, including:

- CIA, FBI, SCS, GCHQ, DSD*;
- non-IC partners such as working groups within the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) and National Labs; and
- many in-house resources such as Forensics, S2C22, S2I, HS2G13, and S2G31.**

What I found was a great group of dedicated professionals who were willing to put in their piece of the puzzle. I'm not sure who came up with the idea that government work is slow, but they probably never worked around here.

Current Events (U):
(S) By the end of my first six-month tour, I had experienced a whirlwind of new tools, agencies,
and programs within NSA. As a result of everyone's collaborative efforts, partnerships were forged, collection was sustained, and reports were issued on Biological Warfare targets. I was even able to travel to Hawaii to discuss BW targets living in Southeast Asia with NSA/CSS Hawaii and members of DSD's CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear) group.
(S//SI) Since that time, I have adjusted to the pace of life here at the NSA. I am currently working in the India Branch of Regional Targets where we are looking for sustained accesses to Indian leadership communications (in a country where face-to-face is the norm). As of today, my nine months have offered me the opportunity to work with some great people, learn from model mentors, and attend many training classes. Some of my favorites have been the Foundstone Ultimate Hacking class and a Terrorist Training Camp (but that is another story).

Conclusion (U):
(U) I am only one of 290(ish) IADP (Intelligence Analysis Development Program) members who are scattered out around the globe. Some are in places with cuddly kangaroos, some are downtown, some are in Georgia, and some are in places that are really hot and dangerous. The fact is, our program has some of the smartest people that I have ever worked with who constantly raise the bar. The Agency is giving us the opportunity to do good things, and that's really all I wanted when I came on board.
(U) My time is up, I thank you for yours.
