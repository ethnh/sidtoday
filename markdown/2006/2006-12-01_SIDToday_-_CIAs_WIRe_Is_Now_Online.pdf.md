# (C) CIA's 'WIRe' Is Now Online... 

FROM: Geoffrey K. Fowler
Managing Editor, World Intelligence Review (CIA)
Run Date: 12/01/2006
(C) Editor's note: This summer CIA launched the "WIRe" as its premiere corporate intelligence publication (see the related article ), containing all-source, finished intelligence. Now, the WIRe is available online, via Intelink. The roll-out announcement follows:
(C) CIA's Directorate of Intelligence is pleased to announce the launch of the World Intelligence Review (WIRe) online -- a JWICs-based version of, and companion to, the daily printed WIRe product. The WIRe online utilizes modern Web technology and tools to convey the full scope of WIRe content in a graphical user interface patterned after the best of public online content presentation.
(C) While the WIRe online and the WIRe hardcopy initially will closely parallel each other with the same selection of articles and general content, the WIRe online reflects a substantial new area of emphasis and expansion of support for our readers. Because of its online nature, we anticipate being able to make many WIRe articles available in a much more robust and timely fashion than is possible with the hardcopy, and users will quickly recognize the substantially enhanced experience provided by the online presentation. Unlike the hardcopy, all published WIRe content is available at your fingertips--not just today's edition--thus allowing users to quickly assess the flow of analysis on key issues.
(C) Individual articles are presented with supporting graphics, and many include multimedia, interactive, and video content not presented in the hardcopy edition. Related articles are also available to viewers as are robust search tools, grouping of content by region and issue for easy review, open-source content, and useful references such as leadership profiles and the World Factbook. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds are supported for users who want to be updated regarding changes in the site.
(C) WIRe readers other than named recipients of the hardcopy version may review TS//SI/TK WIRe content via the site. Customers may continue to access the full archive of CIA reporting available on CIASource by directing their browser to
or through the CIASource link available on the WIRe online.
(C) Readers will recall from our inaugural edition that the transition to the WIRe was a first step in a broader DI [Directorate of Intelligence] initiative, and that planned hallmarks of the WIRe were flexibility of presentation, quality, depth of content, and our commitment to provide timely, comprehensive, and rich insights. With today's issue, the WIRe has reached its 1,000th article published and reaffirms through the deployment of the WIRe online its commitment to pioneer on behalf of its readership. As always, the WIRe invites your continued feedback.
