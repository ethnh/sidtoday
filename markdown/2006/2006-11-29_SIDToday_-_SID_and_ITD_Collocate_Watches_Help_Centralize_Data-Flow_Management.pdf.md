(U//FOUO) SID and ITD Collocate Watches, Help Centralize DataFlow Management

(C) Shepherding data from a collection site, through processing at NSAW or a Cryptologic Center, and on to dissemination to the customer is an exceptionally complex task that requires strong coordination across Enterprise elements. It takes an unusually diverse team of civilian, military, contractor, multi-directorate technicians, and yes, even 2nd and 3rd Party partners, to keep the data moving. Thanks to a 2005 recommendation from the joint ITD-SID Data Flow Governance Board, truly centralized data-flow management at NSA has taken a giant leap forward.
(U//FOUO) In September 2006, the Collection Strategies and Requirements Center Office of Targeting and Mission Management (TMM, S3C3) collocated the 24-hour SIGINT Data-Flow Operations organization with ITD's centralized watch office, the Global Enterprise Command Center (GECC, or X22), to improve inter-directorate trouble-shooting of communications anomalies while streamlining procedures. Born in battle following the 9/11 tragedy, the GECC has quickly established a reputation throughout the global Intelligence Community for providing "best in class" management of the secure SIGINT global telecommunications network, and this new alliance between the GECC and TMM is already yielding impressive results.
(S//SI//REL) By sitting in close proximity and being able to meet face-to-face at any given moment, the GECC's on-duty Director and Enterprise Managers and SID data-flow personnel are able to share knowledge and partner to identify and resolve problems quickly and with minimal impact to mission. GECC personnel oversee and manage the operation of the ITD Enterprise while SID data-flow personnel ensure the correct data is collected, processed, and delivered to the right target office in the timeframe required.
(S//SI//REL) As an example, GECC personnel may work to fix a poorly performing circuit while SID data-flow personnel may remove a badly constructed selector to prevent a large volume of unwanted data from flooding NSA systems. From these collaborative efforts, NSA is experiencing shorter down times, and this, in turn, is resulting in a more reliable and stable product for our consumers and customers.
