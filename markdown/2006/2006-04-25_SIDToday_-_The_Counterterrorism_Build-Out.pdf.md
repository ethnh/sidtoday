(S) The Counterterrorism Build-Out

FROM:
Global Capabilities Manager for CT (S2I)
Run Date: 04/25/2006
(S//SI) Counterterrorism (CT) contributions are made every day by many in the SIGINT enterprise - from various S2 Production Centers, S3 Data Acquisition organizations, SCS sites, NSA Cryptologic Centers, forward-deployed analysts and our foreign partners, to relatively new production partners in the War on Terrorism such as USM-44 (European Security Center) and USM-1 (Fort Belvoir). In addition, new regional language centers such as Utah and Detroit are quickly coming on-line to increase our language capabilities against terrorist targets. Thanks to our talented workforces, each CT entity plays an extraordinary role in providing or supporting valuable and timely information to our customers and partners.
(S//SI) The CT Analysis and Production Enterprise continues to grow and assume greater responsibility for important CT target sets. By reaching out to others in the cryptologic enterprise, we can develop more analytic capacity and exploit more CT targets than any single entity can do alone.
(C) The following describes CT's mission build-out plans by location:
(TS//SI) NSA/CSS Washington : The CT Primary Production Center Manager (PPCM) at NSA-W is Ms. To date, NSA-W hosts the largest share of mission and people supporting the analysis and production of CT targets, and much of the analytic and technical expertise needed to prosecute terrorist targets resides here as well. NSA-W will retain the responsibility for ensuring effective transfer of mission to other production centers and for ensuring the techniques for developing new target sets are transferred as well. To date, NSA-W is expected to retain analysis and production primacy on a variety of terrorism targets in the Mid-East, Africa, Europe, Central Asia and the homeland. In addition, NSA-W will work with the new CT Mission Management Center to prioritize CT target sets, streamline policies and ensure effective synchronization of CT efforts around the globe.
(TS//SI) NSA/CSS Georgia : The CT Production Center Manager (PCM) at NSA-G is Mr. NSA-G already has contributed substantial resources and efforts to the Global War on Terrorism. With the change to a cryptologic center, NSA-G increases their analysis and production (A\&P) responsibilities on existing target sets such as Iraq, and expands their A\&P responsibilities to additional target sets such as Horn of Africa. In addition, their partnerships with foreign partners and SID language authorities are helping to increase our linguist capacity in a variety of low-density, GWOT languages. Overall, NSA-G's primary responsibility remains focused on the Middle East region. The NSA-G CT mission set includes:

- Sunni Extremism, Iraq

- Non-Governmental Orgs (NGOs), HOA (future; in partnership w/CT \& ISI/Follow-the-Money)
(TS//SI) NSA/CSS Texas : The CT PCM at NSA-T has been Ms. who is soon to transition to a new job; Mr. will take the CT helm and continue Ms. s work. Mission build-out at NSA-T will be a phased approach to ultimately have adequate personnel resources to prosecute the entire Sunni Extremism and Hizballah targets in the Americas. FY05 began the initial buildup of the Hizballah and Sunni Extremism effort at NSA Texas. In FY06, efforts continue to build the DNR* and the DNI* CT missions; and work begins to move the related FISA* mission. In addition, NSA-T will continue to work the CT Balkans Mission, currently focused on Islamic extremists in Bosnia who use the location as a facilitation hub and as a jihadist pipeline between Western Europe and the Middle East and South Asia. NSA-T will further develop a CT Eastern European mission. NSA-T has plans to transition to a new facility in FY09
(TS//SI) NSA/CSS Hawaii : The CT PCM at NSA-H is Mr. C. NSA Hawaii has been designated as the "CT hub" in the Pacific. NSA-H will continue its ramp up of CT missions in the Asia Pacific region. The top priority in FY06 was the complete transfer of the CT Philippine mission (including the transfer of Moro Liberation Islamic Front (MILF) mission from NSA-W to NSA-H). This effort consolidates the CT Philippine missions in one location at NSA-H. The top priority in FY07 and beyond will be to continue building a CT capability against other Sunni and Hizballah targets in the Asia Pacific Region. The end state is to have all CT operational activity on CT targets in the Asia Pacific Region located at NSA-H. DSD* and GCSB* are key partners for NSA-H.
(TS//SI) European Security Center : The CT PCM at ESC is Mr. NSA-W is working with ESC to develop a mature, autonomous SIGINT analysis and production capability. ESC currently works a variety of Tier 0 and Tier 1 CT mission sets against select terrorist targets in Europe and Africa. The CT mission set at ESC includes:
- Ansar al-Islam in Germany (assigned Fall 2005)
- Moroccan Islamic Fighting Group (assigned Fall 2005)
- The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat target (transition beginning Spring 2006)
- Lebanese Hizballah/Africa (assigned Spring 2004)
- Lebanese Hizballah/Europe (to be assigned in 2006)
(S//SI) USM-1 (Fort Belvoir) : The CT PCM at USM-1 is Mr. Earlier this year, NSA-W engaged USM-1 to perform telephony research and development on Lebanese Hizballah Technical/Communication Department and those Lebanon/Beirutbased telecommunications and front companies from which Hizballah procures equipment and/or sustains a maintenance capability. The mission set is very important and was previously a gap for the CT enterprise. Future CT mission for USM-1 includes the authority to conduct DNI metadata analysis.
