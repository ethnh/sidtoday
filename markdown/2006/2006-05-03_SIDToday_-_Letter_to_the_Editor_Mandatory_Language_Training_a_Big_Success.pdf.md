(U//FOUO) Here's a comment on the recent article Mandatory Language Training :

# Comment: 

(U//FOUO) I think that the recent completion of the 160-hour language training program was an awesome success. It has inspired many linguists in my work area to learn, and has raised their morale by a large amount which honestly I did not expect. Thank you, SIDtoday for bringing the latest and greatest on this wonderful, fascinating topic.
