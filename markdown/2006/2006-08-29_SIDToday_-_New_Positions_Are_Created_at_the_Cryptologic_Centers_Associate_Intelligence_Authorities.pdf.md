(U//FOUO) As the planning matured in 2004 and 2005 for mission build-out and workforce expansion at the Regional SIGINT Operations Centers, creating what are now the four CCs in Georgia, Texas, Colorado, and Hawaii, it became clear that the functions and responsibilities of the NSA/CSS Senior Intelligence Authority (SIA) in respect to IA workforce shaping, development, and sustainment needed to be replicated at each of the CCs. To that end, Cindy Farkus, the SIA and Assistant Deputy Director for Analysis and Production, asked that each CC advertise for and select a senior (GGD-15) Intelligence Analyst to serve as the CC's NSA/CSS Associate Intelligence Authority (AIA).
(U//FOUO) Collectively, the SIA's and AIAs' primary purpose is to help mission managers acquire the IA workforce they need; ensure that all IAs have the skills, knowledge, abilities, tools, opportunities, and leadership they need to perform effectively and grow professionally; and represent and speak for the profession and disciplines of cryptologic intelligence analysis across the global cryptologic enterprise, the U.S. and foreign partner Intelligence Communities, the federal government, academia, and private industry.
