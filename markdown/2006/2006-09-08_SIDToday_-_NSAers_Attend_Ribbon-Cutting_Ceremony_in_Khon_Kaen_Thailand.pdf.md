(S//SI) Team Thailand (F47)
Run Date: 09/08/2006
(S//SI) Our Third Party colleagues in Thailand get a new operations building.
(S//SI) On 29 June 2006, our Thai SIGINT partners hosted S33 FORNSAT Division Chief and members of Team Thailand in a dedication and ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Division Six (the Thai SIGINT element) site in Khon Kaen, Thailand.
(S//SI) MG Phiroon, Mark Cronin of Team Thailand, and
(c) (S//SI) The group joined Division Six in dedicating a new Third Party operations building at the Khon Kaen site, and celebrated the robust SIGINT relationship between NSA and Division Six (part of AFSC, the Thai Armed Forces Security Center). In accordance with Buddhist tradition, a group of monks blessed the new facility with holy water and trees were planted to signify life and longevity.

(S//SI) NSA provided funding for construction of the new operations building, which replaced an aging and inadequate facility previously located on the same site. The old building was destroyed in mid-June, just in time for dedication of the new facility. The new operations building provides a spacious and modern working environment with ample offices and meeting rooms, and an operations floor with plenty of room for current mission and future mission expansion.
(S//SI) The building dedication and ribbon-cutting ceremony was presided over by AFSC Deputy Commander MG Piroon Palponsong, with formal remarks from Mark Cronin. This new building serves as a tangible reflection of our long-standing commitment to helping Division Six improve its SIGINT operations throughout Thailand, especially in Khon Kaen, where Division Six also allows NSA to maintain First Party-only SIGINT operations at our INDRA facility.
