Where: FANX 2 Auditorium
(U) See below for details on how to register.
(U) Are you interested in learning more about the Trusted Foundry and the full suite of microelectronics products and services available to you, including integrated circuit system engineering, logical and physical design, package engineering, assembly, product assurance, and failure analysis? If so, please join us on 9 November 2006 to learn more about the Trusted Foundry and how to acquire end-to-end microelectronic services from I6. Representatives from IBM will be present to discuss their available technologies and roadmap including high performance (GHz range), radiation-hardened (Rad-Hard) by design, embedded non-volatile memory, and intellectual property.
(U) NSA and IBM partnered to establish the Trusted Foundry to guarantee access to the manufacture of world-class sensitive and classified microelectronics semiconductor wafers for NSA, the Intelligence Community, and DoD. This relationship with industry provides customers access to leading-edge technologies that will keep pace with rapid industry advances and customer demands.
(U) This symposium is open to all cleared NSA/CSS civilian and military employees of NSA, and contractors whose parent companies hold a valid confidential disclosure agreement (CDA) with IBM. System engineering and technical assistance contractors are covered under NSA's CDA with IBM.
