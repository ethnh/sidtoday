(S) Info on Ships Is Now Available to the SECRET-Level Warfighter

(S) Info on the identity, location, cargo, etc. of ships around the world now available to the tactical user.
(S) SIGINTers and their tactical customers live in different worlds. SIGINTers deal every day with highly classified material, while most US military forces are cleared only to the "straightSECRET*" level. How to bridge the gap? We do this by deleting all information hinting at our SIGINT sources and methods (a process called "sanitization") before sending out the intelligence. The bad news: sanitization is often a time-consuming, labor-intensive process. The good news: there are times when we can automate the process.
(S) A case in point is the success SID has had in using existing technology to sanitize data from the shipborne Automatic Identification System (AIS) signal, for release at the SECRET level. AIS is a PROFORMA data link associated with maritime cargo, merchant, and other vessels over 300 tons. The signal provides ship information (e.g. identification, position, course, speed, destination, cargo contents, etc.) to worldwide WRANGLER database users and various customers.
(S) It's easy to see why this information might be of interest to tactical customers who are cleared to the SECRET level. The data supports the tracking of large vessels that may be involved in illicit trade, smuggling, or even terrorism-related activities. However, at 1.2 million records a day, there is no way SIGINTers could possibly sanitize this material by hand, even if they wanted to! Last year, Weapons and Space's Data Services Division (S2J1) took advantage of existing technology -- known as the RADIANT MERCURY guard device - to solve this problem.
(S) RADIANT MERCURY receives the data, sanitizes the content and, on a near-realtime basis, forwards the results to tactical users (like the US Coast Guard and US Navy) via the Integrated Broadcast Service Support Office (IBSSO). The data is also available presanitized in the WRANGLER database, which can be used for historical purposes.
(S) This technology has narrowed the "classification gap" in a seamless way and helped us deliver timely intelligence to the customers who can use it.
