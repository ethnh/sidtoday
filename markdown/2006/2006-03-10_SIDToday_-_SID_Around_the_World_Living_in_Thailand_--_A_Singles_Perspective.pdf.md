(C) SID Around the World: Living in Thailand -- A Single's Perspective

FROM:
Office Manager/Protocol Officer, NCR Thai (C)* Run Date: 03/10/2006
(C) Here's our second SID Around the World article of the year, describing what it is like to live in Bangkok, Thailand...
(U) Living in Bangkok is a wondrous adventure to behold. Don't believe the hype about Bangkok being a third-world country. Bangkok is similar to any big city all over the world. The differences you find in Bangkok will probably be the uniqueness the people bring to any country. In Bangkok you need to keep an open mind and a pleasant disposition. You have two choices with your approach to Bangkok: you can either enjoy the experiences it has to offer or be forced to begrudge the day you stepped on its soil. I chose the first attitude; having an open mind is the best way to go when living in Bangkok.
(U) The people of Thailand have the uniqueness to pique your senses and a yearning for adventure. The Thai people are very patient, tolerant, gracious and accepting of people new to the country. Their Jai yen (meaning "cool heart") attitude and lovely smile will make one return in kind. There are many customs the Thai people are famous for, and you can enhance your knowledge by going out and enjoying what this country can reveal to you.
(C) I have had a very good tour in Bangkok as a single female. Yes, I know the perception is Thailand is a "man's paradise," but I can tell you Thailand has many wonders for a single woman to enjoy. One area of delight many women enjoy is the opportunity to have clothes tailored in every design, color, fabric, etc. Thailand is very famous for their gorgeous silk fabrics. If you are looking for everyday-wear clothing, Thailand has many textiles from which to choose. The possibilities are endless. Another avenue of delight is the purchasing opportunities of the various gems and jewelry available in Thailand.
(U) If you prefer to forego the expensive route, then traveling in Thailand is also available for the adventurous woman. The beaches of Phuket, Jomtien, Ko Samet, Hua Hin and Pattaya you have to see to believe. I've had the opportunity to enjoy all of these beaches and more during my tour. The waters are beautiful bluegreen and aquamarine in color, and you can see to the bottom even in deeper waters.
(U) During the high season (November-January) the beaches can become quite expensive and crowded. I prefer to travel during the off seasons, February-May; the prices are reasonable and you receive a palatial room for pennies and travel packages (to include flights) are more reasonable than going to Caribbean destinations. And traveling as a single woman is just as safe as walking to your corner grocery store. Being alert is the key in any big city; therefore, being aware of your surroundings is still needed. I have never had a problem when traveling in Bangkok or any area within

Thailand, but it is always fun to do so with a friend. That brings me to another plus for Thailand - the cost of living.
(U) The cost of living in Thailand can shock you in such a way you would never want to live back home again. You can get just about everything your heart desires and live the life of a queen. Bangkok allows one to enjoy the leisure part of life, if you want. The personal and domestic services available to a single person allows one to enjoy life in Thailand like you would never enjoy, unless very wealthy, living in the United States. You can hire a maid for less than $\$ 100$ a month or $\$ 1200$ per year as a single person. Most domestic services include: cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing, and babysitting children and/or pets. Tell me where you find that kind of help so cheaply? And the Thai domestic help are kind and trustworthy; therefore, no need to worry about your valuables.
(U) I have had the good fortune to find a very good maid, who has been with me for close to 3 years. She practically runs my household, which leaves me available to do whatever my heart desires.
(U) Bangkok, Thailand provides so many opportunities, it would take me many pages to inform you of them -- but you get the gist of it. I've thoroughly enjoyed my tour and hope this review has enlightened others to take a step on a new adventure.
