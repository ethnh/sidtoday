(U//FOUO) Proposal: Mid-Career Reorientation Class
FROM: SIGINT Communications (S0202)
Unknown
Run Date: 11/17/2006
(U//FOUO) Mid-career SIGINTers: We'd like your feedback on a proposed new program -- a reorientation class for veteran SID employees.
(U//FOUO) The proposal: To hold sessions to reintroduce mid-career SIGINTers to the Signals Intelligence Directorate.
(U//FOUO) The rationale: If you've been working in SIGINT for 10 or 20 years, it's been some time since you first sat through the "Intro to NSA" classes (such as the old CY-157) you may have attended when you EOD'ed. Since that time, there have been many changes to NSA, and to SID specifically: new organizations created, others disbanded, new leadership, new ways of operating. Workers are, of course, familiar with their home office and the issues surrounding it, but perhaps many have lost track of the larger SID-wide picture (especially if they took tours outside of SID, or took a leave of absence), and would benefit from a brief reorientation.
(U) The next step: We'd like your feedback on this idea.

- Do you think such a program would be beneficial?
- If so, how long should it be - a half-day, one day, two days?
- What would you like to see in terms of content?
- Who should be encouraged to take the class?
- Any other thoughts?
(U) Your feedback will largely determine whether or not we proceed with this idea, and (if we do) the form the reorientation will take. Please send your comments to
$\square$ . Thanks!
