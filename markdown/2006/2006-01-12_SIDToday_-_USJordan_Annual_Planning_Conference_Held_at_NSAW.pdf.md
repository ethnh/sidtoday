(S//SI) US/Jordan Annual Planning Conference Held at NSAW

(S//SI) US, Jordan discuss the fight against terrorism.
(S//SI) The US/Jordan Annual Planning Conference recently took place at NSAW. A three-person delegation from the Jordanian Electronic Warfare Directorate (EWD) and a four-person delegation from the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate (GID) traveled to NSA to attend the conference. The conference included high-level meetings between EWD leadership, DIRNSA, SID Director and FAD leadership.
(S//SI) The main thrust of these meetings included discussions on NSA and EWD's joint interest in fighting terrorism. EWD, who has traditionally provided assistance to NSA on more conventional targets and collection, wants to play a much more active role in the Global War on Terrorism (GWoT). They emphasized the fact that terrorists are no longer using conventional methods to communicate but instead are using GSM, Thuraya, and High-Powered Cordless Phones. During the meetings with DIRNSA and the SID Director, EWD asked for NSA's assistance in acquiring some of this technology, specifically an air-interface GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) capability. NSA is currently looking at ways to assist the Jordanian EWD in this regard.
(S//SI) The GID portion of the conference focused mainly on the NSA/GID special collection initiative. Discussions focused on the expansion and growth of that program. In addition, GID asked for NSA's assistance with their FORNSAT capability. NSA promised to provide technical assistance as needed.
(S//SI) Overall, the conference stressed the need for additional cooperation between the US and Jordan in support of the GWOT.
