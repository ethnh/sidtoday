(U) Reservist SIGINTers Pitching In From Sites Across the Country

(U) Far-flung military Reservists assist NSA offices, working as part of "virtual teams." Can they help you, too?
(U) Many military Reservists have valuable cryptologic skills that can help the Agency carry out its SIGINT mission. They typically fulfill their Reserve obligations by spending one weekend per month doing just that. But what happens when the Reservists don't live near Ft Meade or one of the Cryptologic Centers - are they out of luck? Not at all. In fact, Reserve Component personnel carry out SIGINT work from over 40 Reserve and National Guard sites across the country. (See a map .)
(U) This program is managed by SID's Reserve Mission Management (RMM) organization, which provides a virtual, web-based architecture to integrate Reserve Component (RC) cryptologists into the NSA Extended Enterprise. This architecture allows the cryptologists the chance to serve on the "front lines" with high-priority missions as members of a "Virtual Team."
(U//FOUO) One such mission area supported by Reserve cryptologists is the China/Korea Product Line (S2B). They work on topics such as North Korea food-related issues, activities that produce revenue for North Korea, or efforts to establish stability for the regime. With North Korea once again encountering starvation conditions, the Intel Community is very interested in what they are buying, selling or producing, to include fertilizers, pesticides, and farming equipment.
(S//SI) Reservists have begun to meet immediate S2B needs to scan and translate certain Chinese material to determine its value to the Intel Community. Since there are no full-time resources allocated to this effort, Reservists are the sole producers of this information: they scan the material, determine the appropriate priorities, and translate and forward the foreignlanguage data as needed.
(S//SI) Currently, seven RC Linguists are providing support for this effort at four Reserve sites around the country. These linguists range from native speakers to trained linguists who achieved 2/2 (i.e. limited working proficiency) on their annual DLPT (Defense Language Proficiency Test). One superior linguist performed 14 lengthy translations during his drill weekend (2 days) during the month of April. The target office had very positive comments about the support received.
(U) Can you use additional help from qualified Reserve linguists and analysts? Could you use that extra mission support? Let's talk. Please contact us via:
