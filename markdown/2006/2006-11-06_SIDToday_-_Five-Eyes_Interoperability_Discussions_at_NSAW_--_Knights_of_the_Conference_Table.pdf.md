(U//FOUO) Five-Eyes Interoperability Discussions at NSAW -- Knights of the Conference Table?

(S//SI//REL) Did you ever wonder how the exchange of data and targeting is accomplished to collect worldwide SIGINT? The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) Office of Targeting and Mission Management (TMM) hosted two conferences contemporaneously in early October on these very topics. TMM hosted the Global Targeting Implementation Group (GTIG) and the Data Flow Management Working Group (DFMWG), successfully resolving issues and problems to ensure targeting selectors of interest and sharing resultant collection would continue.

# (U//FOUO) Global Targeting Implementation Group 

(S//SI//REL) The GTIG was focused on the completion of an Interoperability Interface Control Document (ICD) related to targeting connectivity. Following a tripartite workshop in May 2006, a number of key issues emerged requiring further discussion. The five partners need to reach a consensus on a common business process for selector interoperability. Agreement on this process will lead ultimately to a common exchange interface, which will be implemented by NSA's Unified Targeting Tool (UTT), GCHQ's MONKEY PUZZLE, CSE's PEPPER BOX and the systems selected by DSD and GCSB (likely, but not confirmed, to be NSA's 2PUTT System).
(S//SI//REL) The ultimate aim of the five partners is to implement strong selector exchange to allow interoperability into the future - allowing access to current capabilities offered by WEALTHYCLUSTER 2 and those promised by TURBULENCE and beyond.

## (U//FOUO) Data Flow Management Working Group

(S//SI//REL) The Data Flow Managers were also concerned about interoperability. Data exchange is paramount to continued success against the Global War on Terrorism and other crises. Specific agreements were reached regarding the status of the data exchange mechanism, and the use of zip codes for distribution of voice collection. Also discussed was a plan for sharing of targeted Short Message Service (SMS) traffic. Legal and policy issues also need to be reviewed to move forward with a more extensive process for sharing this data, and a plan exists to do so.

## (U) Volume of Collection and Targeting

(S//SI//REL) Volume was a topic that was discussed by both working groups. Because every partner is being affected by the volume of collection and targeting, they are taking actions individually and jointly to ascertain the impacts to their respective infrastructures and processes. Since volumes are not expected to drop with TURBULENCE and other pending efforts, continued knowledge sharing of the actions taken by each partner to deal with incoming volumes is vital. All agreed to continue to share all of their attempted efforts, whether they are successful or not.

## (U) A Celebratory "Knight" Out

(U//FOUO) Even though the conferences were held in nearby rooms, busy agendas limited the interaction between the two groups. To round out the week's activities, we celebrated success with a dinner at Medieval Times, where we "knighted" a British participant -- don't tell the Queen.
