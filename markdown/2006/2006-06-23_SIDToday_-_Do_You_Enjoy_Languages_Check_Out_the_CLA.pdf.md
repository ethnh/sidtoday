(U) The second in our series of articles about NSA's Learned Organizations...
(U//FOUO) The Crypto-Linguistic Association (CLA) is the NSA/CSS professional organization devoted to the support of our language community. Founded in 1965 by Sydney Jaffe (pictured), one of the most brilliant language analysts our country has ever produced, the CLA functions as a forum to highlight the accomplishments of the language community, a venue to share problems and expertise, and an advocate to help develop language skills to the highest possible level.
(U//FOUO) Currently, the CLA has over 300 members, and is continually growing. In fact, just this past year new branches of the CLA were established at NSA/Texas and NSA/Georgia.
(U//FOUO) The CLA works closely with the Senior Language Authority (SLA) to develop and promote programs and events for the benefit of the language community, not only here at NSA, but also in the broader language community throughout the country. The CLA and the SLA have a special Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) which creates a synergy which is of benefit to both.
(U//FOUO) Among the activities the CLA sponsors are:

- A monthly speaker series. Recently we have had talks such as "The Decipherment of Linear B" and "Translator Tools for the 21st Century."
- Mini language courses to broaden the community's knowledge of the world's languages. This past year we featured mini-courses in Mongolian and Xhosa.
- Conversation hours in 20 languages, including Farsi, Arabic, Korean, Kurdish, Chinese and many more. These give participants-language analysts and people from other skill fields who wish to join- opportunities to practice their oral and aural skills in a friendly atmosphere.
- An annual banquet with a nationally recognized speaker on a topic of interest to the language community.
- An always expanding foreign film and audio library, from which CLA members can check out films, audio books and music free of charge and with no hassle. At last count we had more than 170 films in 54 languages.
- An annual book swap, both at Ft. Meade and FANX.
- A foreign language film festival, which this year presented

- Field trips to places of interest to the language community. In the past year, CLA members have had fascinating, classified, behind-the-scenes tours of the Secret Service, the Center for Advanced Study of Language and the National Virtual Translation Center.
(U//FOUO) To honor the achievements of language analysts, the CLA presents four prestigious annual awards. For long-term language achievement, there is the Sydney Jaffe Award for civilians and the Captain Joseph Rochefort Award for military personnel. For extraordinary achievement by mid-career language analysts, the CLA presents the Norman Wild Award to civilians and Colonel Alva B. Lasswell Award to military personnel.
(U//FOUO) All of these awards honor language professionals whose outstanding mission accomplishments reflect the tradition of leadership, ingenuity, and scholarship exemplified by their namesakes. The names past winners can be seen on the award plaques at the CLA Awards Wall in OPS2B.
(U//FOUO) We enthusiastically encourage anyone who enjoys language to join the CLA. You don't have to be a language analyst. We can help you enhance your language skills, learn more about language, and get to know some of the best language analysts on the planet. Last but not least, it's fun!
