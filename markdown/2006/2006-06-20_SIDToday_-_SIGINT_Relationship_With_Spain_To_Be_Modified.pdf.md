(S//SI) In addition to terrorist targets, NSA and Spain to now cooperate on Russian organized crime.
(S//SI) In response to a Foreign Affairs Directorate-sponsored request to modify the existing NSA SIGINT relationship with Spain, the Office of the Director for National Intelligence has approved an expansion of SIGINT exchange. Since July 2002, NSA has jointly targeted several terrorist groups with Spain's Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (CNI, National Intelligence Center), most notably the ETA separatist group. Now, with the ODNI approval, NSA can embark on a new target set, that of Russian Organized Crime. Additionally, the expansion approval raises the level of the relationship to Top Secret.
(S//SI) Initially discussed with the foreign partner in May 2005, the subject of Organized Crime quickly became a primary target beneficial to both services. Both services easily identified nearly a dozen targets of mutual interest.
(S//SI) With the approval in hand, FAD and S2F21 (Transnational Organized Crime) will now pursue the expanded relationship with CNI. The first formal discussions will be held at the annual CT Analytic Conference to be held in June 2006 at NSAW.
