(U//FOUO) Do you have an Intelink account? If not, it's easy to get one!
(U//FOUO) NSANet may be the "home" system for NSAers, but every day we interact ever more closely with the other DoD and Intelligence Community agencies - and that means the use of Intelink is also expanding. Are you taking full advantage of what's available on Intelink?

# (U) 17K Users 

(U//FOUO) A quick check shows that there are almost 14,000 Intelink accounts in the NSAW group. This doesn't even count users at Cryptologic Centers, field sites, and elsewhere. In addition, Intelink access is still being provided via legacy systems. If we had to guess, we would estimate that, including NSAW and the extended enterprise, more than 17,000 NSAers have Intelink accounts.

## (U) How to Get It

(U//FOUO) There are two types of potential Intelink users: those who already have an account and those who don't. For most of those who don't, getting an Intelink account is an easy matter, requiring only three things: US citizenship, TS//SI/TK clearances, and supervisor approval. Contractors are also eligible with Contracting Officer Representative (COR) approval. If you meet these requirements, then to get an account, just fill out the application. To do that, go on to NSANet, type " go itsc," click on "Request an Account," and then select "Intelink" (the one on the left side of the page).
(U//FOUO) RSCH2002, Introduction to Intelink, is available to help users who seek more information about how to navigate through the Intelink environment and how to more effectively use the search engines. Contrary to rumor, however, the class is not required prior to requesting an Intelink account -- nor should users wait to complete the class prior to requesting an account.

## (U) How to Use It

(U//FOUO) Some of the many NSAers who already have Intelink accounts haven't actually used them because of a false impression that doing so is "too hard." Not true: just activate the VPN Dialer (Start > Programs > CISCO Systems VPN Client > VPN Dialer). Once you activate the VPN dialer, you can get to Intelink in several ways. Bring up any browser and:

1. Type in any Intelink URL (e.g. www.insw.neu.com) or
2. Click on any Intelink URL on a web page or in an email, or
3. On NSA Daily (www.nsa), select "Ext Connections," then click on the link for Intelink. (Similarly, a link exists on SID today under "External Connections.")
(U) In each case, you will need to log in using the same password you used to activate your VPN dialer. You can also bookmark your favorite Intelink URLs for quick access in the future.

## (U) What's Available

(U//FOUO) On Intelink you will find a wealth of information about the activities of our IC partners (e.g., CIA and DIA), DoD elements (e.g., CENTCOM, PACOM, etc.), and DHS/Law Enforcement organizations. Intelink also provides access to numerous databases and applications (e.g., weather information, Jane's, etc.). In many cases, Intelink is the only place
such information is available.
(U//FOUO) NSA also supports our customers by providing a wide range of information such as SIGINT product, post-publication requests, access to databases such as WRANGLER, NTOC Threat Reports, the IAD documents, and many other products and services.
(U//FOUO) Intelink has existed for almost 12 years (see a previous article ), and is more useful than ever before. We encourage you to make full use of it in the course of your work.
