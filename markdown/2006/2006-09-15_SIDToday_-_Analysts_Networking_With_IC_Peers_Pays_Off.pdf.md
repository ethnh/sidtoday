(U) Analysts: Networking With IC Peers Pays Off

(U//FOUO) Collaboration with our analytic peers at other Agencies can reap great rewards. The following example from the Office of International Security Issues (S2C) illustrates how "two heads" can be better than one when dealing with a complex issue and the great success that can be achieved when NSA analysts work closely with their counterparts.
(U//FOUO) From Regina Hambleton, the NSA/CSS Representative - Defense, and former Global Capabilities Manager for International Security Issues (S2C):
(C) I am sure that there are many success stories that derive from NSA and CIA collaboration. I just wanted to share with you another that has its roots in a Career Analysis Program (CAP) tour that a CIA analyst took within NSA.
(C) International Security Issues mission has benefited from the work of several analysts who came to NSA for 6 weeks under CAP. We integrate them into the workforce and use their language and analytic skills to produce SIGINT reports. If there are customer visits, community analytic discussions, or target relevant meetings the CIA analysts are also encouraged to participate. At the end of their tours, all the analysts have said it was a worthwhile experience -improving their understanding of SIGINT and providing them with a network of contacts. The CIA analyst in this story was a CAP participant in 2003. It only goes to underscore that these relationships can be long lasting.

# (U) The Story: 

(S//SI) International Security Issues (ISI) was recently analyzing a lengthy French-language conversation concerning international agricultural negotiations. The conversation provided great detail but was VERY technical. After very long and thorough research, a senior ISI analyst felt she had figured out the majority of it, but 1) wanted a second opinion, and 2) still needed one piece to the puzzle. She called a CIA counterpart who had been an integree in the ISI office for one month back in 2003.
(S//SI) They discussed the problem areas in detail; the ISI analyst sent her counterpart the text in question and the two spent a very long time working on it together. According to the ISI analyst, it was interesting to see her CIA counterpart almost immediately put ideas together that had taken her a lot longer to grasp.
(C) In the words of the ISI senior analyst, her counterpart is a fabulous resource who is very willing to help and generous with her time. She would likely be willing to work with the other ISI branches if the need arises. Getting to know her has really demonstrated the value of having experts from other agencies integrated here (and vice versa) for a period of time.

## (U) Making Contacts of Your Own...

(U) Analysis and Production has made "Achieving a collaborative analytic community" a strategic goal for 2007-2010. One way to achieve this goal is by working more closely with our customers, providing them with a more complete intelligence picture through collaborative analysis.
(U) Working closely with our counterparts at other Agencies benefits both parties and insures that the Intelligence Community (IC) is providing the best intelligence to our customers, be they policy makers or the war-fighter in the field. Now is the time to reach out to your counterparts -
- pick up the phone, start an e-mail exchange, or arrange for a visit. If you're not sure who your counterpart is at a specific agency, work with the folks in Customer Gateway who will be glad to put you in touch with the right NSA liaison. Working together we can put the "pieces of the puzzle" together and accomplish so much more.
