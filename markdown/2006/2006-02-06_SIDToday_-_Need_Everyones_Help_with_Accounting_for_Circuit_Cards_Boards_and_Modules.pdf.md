(U//FOUO) Need Everyone's Help with Accounting for Circuit Cards, Boards, and Modules

FROM: SID Property Accountability (S02S1)
Run Date: 02/06/2006
(U//FOUO) The New Year is the perfect time to commit to accomplishing the really important things that need to get done. Here we are already in February 2006, getting ready to start a new year for property accountability and inventory. In 2006, SID hopes to achieve, through hard work and communication, the same or better success than the 2005 inventory. SID results for the 2005 inventory were the best yet - 99.75\% of all SID property was found. This year we will have new types of items to account for, and need to dedicate ourselves if we are going to achieve $100 \%$ in the 2006 inventory.
(U//FOUO) For 2006, new items have been added to the Agency-Owned Accountable Property (AOAP) list, namely circuit cards, circuit boards, and circuit modules. This means we will now be inventorying these items in addition to our existing property. The items can be very elusive if not tracked from the day they are received. It is the kind of item that can end up hidden in a drawer or placed in another piece of equipment, and consequently not accounted for during inventory.
(U//FOUO) We have taken time to develop a procedure to help track and account for these items from the day they are received until their developer uses them. If you go to the SID Property page and visit the "Barcoding Circuit Cards" link, you will see an explanation of how these items should be tracked and accounted for.
(U//FOUO) Again, this is a new year with new items to account for, so the best way to do this is to help by understanding the process that has been laid out for you. In short, Property Accountability is everyone's responsibility. By following these guidelines, SID almost certainly can achieve its goal of $100 \%$ accountability for all property.
(U//FOUO) If you have any questions about property management in SID please contact Ms. (S) (S) (S), Chief S02S1 on (s).
