(U//FOUO) The NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center (NTOC) presents "Meet Us at the NTOC: Opportunities Day," to acquaint participants with our history and progress to date, share information about our mission and ongoing initiatives, and introduce opportunities to become part of our talented and dedicated team. Join us to learn about one of NSA's earliest initiatives in executing SIGINT and information assurance cross-mission collaboration and to hear about job opportunities in the NTOC.
(U//FOUO) The NTOC was established in June 2005 to address the growing threat to U.S. information networks vital to the nation's security. Through its own performance and key partnerships, the NTOC seeks to deliver and build unmatched capability in its key mission areas of network cognizance, threat characterization and assessment, and Computer Network Operation (CNO) synchronization.
(U//FOUO) Registration is not required. Because seating in the NTOC Command Center is limited to 50 people, participants will be admitted on a first come, first served basis.
(U//FOUO) For those unable to attend this session, we will be offering a second session in the near future at a time to be determined.
