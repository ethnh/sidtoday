(U) Retention Allowance: No Effect on Promos or Awards

FROM:
SID Workforce Performance Executive (S0)
Run Date: 03/14/2006
(U) There was a question at MG Quirk's recent town meeting regarding retention allowances.
(U) Retention allowances have no impact on promotions, QSIs, or any awards. Funding for retention allowances is provided by the Associate Directorate for Human Resources (ADHRS). Requests are forwarded through the organization's management to the SID Chief of Staff for approval. Once approved, they are sent to ADHRS for approval/funding. The policy for requesting retention allowances can be found at:

# HRS admin newsletter 

(U) Each year, managers are required to review the retention allowances for each of their employees and provide an assessment for the continuation, adjustment or termination of that allowance. Supervisors must document their recommendation and return their decision back to ADHRS for final Agency approval. This review is normally initiated in October of each year.
(U) At this time, all requests for new retention allowances and those allowances reviewed during the annual process have been forwarded to ADHRS for final approval. Employees should receive pay adjustments within the next few pay periods.
(U//FOUO) Please contact me if you have any questions regarding this response.
