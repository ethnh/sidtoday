(U) The Crypto-Mathematics Institute Adds Up

FROM: Joe McCloskey
President, CMI
Run Date: 06/30/2006
(U//FOUO) The Crypto-Mathematics Institute (CMI) is the oldest of the Learned Organizations at NSA. It was established by Lieutenant General John A. Samford, Director, NSA, in a memorandum dated October 1957. The CMI has been an integral part of the mathematics community at NSA ever since its inception.
(U//FOUO) The purpose of the Institute is to promote those aspects of mathematics which pertain to cryptology and to provide a focal point for the NSA mathematics community in fields of common interest. Its membership is open to anyone with an interest in mathematics, both applied and cryptologic in nature.
(U//FOUO) CMI sponsors a variety of social and scholarly events, often in conjunction with an Agency office or the Professional Health Program (PHP). Recently, on June 9, 2006, CMI and CES cosponsored MATHFEST . This year's MATHFEST included eight classified talks by members of the community on a wide range of topics of current interest.
(U//FOUO) The annual CMI Awards Banquet was held on the evening of June 9, 2006 at Windows on the Bay Restaurant in Pasadena, Maryland and 186 attendees were present. The Institute bestows a variety of honors at the annual banquet: the CMI Teaching Award, the Essay Contest Awards, Distinguished Memberships, Distinguished Service, and the CMI President's Award. These awards taken together indicate the value that the CMI places on education, achievement, service to the community, and the written preservation of our unique cryptologic literature.
(U//FOUO)The CMI Teaching Award was established in 1997 to honor important teaching contributions to the mathematics community.

- Teacher of the Year, 2005: $\square$

The CMI Essay Contest was established in 1959 to recognize outstanding written contributions to the fields of mathematics and cryptology in two categories: research and applications. (There were two winners this year for the latter.)

CMI Essay Contest Winners 2005:

- Winner, Research: $\square$, Suneel Sundar
(U) A Tutorial on Hilbert Series
- Honorable Mention, Research: Douglas J. Shors
(C) Things that Commute with Codebooks (Especially AES)
- Winner, Applications: Art Drisko, $\square$
(U//FOUO) HONESTY Pays: Three Strikes, Not Out
