(U//FOUO) Client Central: Share the Results of Your Customer Exchanges

FROM:
Customer Gateway, CRM Technologies (S11)
Run Date: 10/24/2006
(U) Do you have phone or email exchanges with SID customers? Attend conferences or make visits to customer locations? Participate in analyst-to-analyst exchanges?
(U//FOUO) If so, the benefits derived from such exchanges -- the unique insights into a customer's viewpoint -- have most likely been limited to a small audience: you, your close colleagues, and perhaps your management. No mechanism has existed for you to communicate the results of your customer exchanges with the rest of the enterprise. Until now.
(U//FOUO) With the new version of Client Central -- SID's web tool for viewing customer profiles, visits and interactions -- anyone across the corporation can document interactions they have with SID customers. Simply type " go client-central," click on the highlights tab, choose the link in the upper right corner to enter a highlight, and a voila, a form pops up to allow you to summarize an exchange you have had with a customer.
(U//FOUO) Highlights so entered become corporate knowledge -- available to anyone with NSAnet and a PKI certificate. They can be retrieved later, viewed by customer, sorted by date, and so on.
(U//FOUO) Client Central also offers the capability to attach documents (PowerPoint briefings, Word files, etc.) and provide feedback on existing customer interactions. In addition, the new release provides an improved interface, while still offering the basic features: upcoming and past SID visits (including agendas and summaries of key visits) and a profile of each SID customer, as well as the highlights of interactions.
(U//FOUO) Future releases will enable users to enter and view customer interactions by topic (tied to the Strategic Mission List). For more information on Client Central, both the current version and future plans, contact Your input can help drive upcoming releases.
