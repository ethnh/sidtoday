(U) Branch Managers' Responsibilities for SOD-CPE Rollout

FROM:
Chief, ISS's Marketing and Communications Branch (S12M2)
Run Date: 09/29/2006
(U) CPE Administrators need Branch Managers to provide certain pieces of information prior to their branches scheduled rollout (information is listed below). Providing this information will enable CPE administrators to create your CPE settings according to your specifications, which will ease the transition from SOD to CPE and lessen the impact to your organizations. The best opportunity to provide this information will be at the hands-on training.
(U) Please be sure to provide the following information to the S12 Integration Team (dl s12_integration):

- (U) Appropriate CPE branch name
- (U) This name does NOT have to align with your organizational name but instead can align with your subject of interest. Naming your branch this way will prevent issues in the event of a re-organization.
- (U) List of branch members and roles
- (U) Roles will be defined at the hands-on training or can be found on the CPE webpage
(U) Because SOD pick lists will not be transitioned to CPE, it is recommended that you immediately create your branch pick lists on the first day of your SOD-CPE rollout.


## (U) Upcoming

(U) Further details on CPE will be forthcoming on a regular basis via CPE communiqu√©s between now and the rollout. For more information on CPE, please visit the CPE website ("go cpe").
