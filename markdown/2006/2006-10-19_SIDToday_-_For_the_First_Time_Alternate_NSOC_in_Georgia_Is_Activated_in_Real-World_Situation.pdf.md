(S) For the First Time, Alternate NSOC in Georgia Is Activated in RealWorld Situation

FROM:
NSAG, DECKPIN Coordinator
Run Date: 10/19/2006
(S) The NSA/CSS Georgia-based alternate $\underline{\text { NSOC }}$ (known as DECKPIN) was activated this summer, the first time this has happened in a real-world, no-notice scenario. DECKPIN was created to take over critical NSOC functions, should the Fort Meade facility ever lose its ability to operate, for any reason. On this occasion, the DECKPIN activation was prompted by a reduced power supply in NSOC. Here's how the story developed:
(S) In late July, high temperatures in the Baltimore area and problems with Baltimore Gas and Electric power generation caused server and communications failures around the NSA Washington complex. Those failures resulted in a critical limitation in NSOC's ability to provide full CRITIC* support to the Intelligence Community. Late on 31 July, the NSOC Senior Operations Officer (SOO) notified the NSA/CSS Georgia (NSAG) Watch Officer that the DECKPIN IT infrastructure should be activated as a contingency, and the equipment was warm-started accordingly.
(S) Early in the morning of 1 August, the SOO alerted NSAG to go to full activation, and a full recall of DECKPIN personnel began at 0400Z**. Team B DECKPIN was on duty by 0445Z, and each of the manned DECKPIN desks coordinated activities with their counterparts at NSAW. At 0800Z the SOO called and reported that NSOC was sufficiently functional to release the DECKPIN team. The IT infrastructure, along with personnel support, were also placed on standby during the day and evening of 3 August, to ensure availability while the BGE work was completed.
(S) The successful real-world activation of DECKPIN proved that the NSOC Continuity-ofOperations Program (COOP) is fully functional and that NSAG is prepared to back up NSOC, should the need ever arise in future.

(U) Notes:

* (C) A "CRITIC" is critical information concerning possible foreign threats to US national security that are so significant that they require the immediate attention of the President and the National Security Council. CRITIC information is sent at the highest precedence by the most rapid means available to ensure delivery within 10 minutes.
** (U) Z, or Zulu Time, is the standard used in watch operations around the world. It equates to Greenwich Mean Time.
