(S//SI) Tools for the Mission
FROM: the Target Knowledge Branch (S32233)
Unknown
Run Date: 07/10/2006
(S//SI) The Target Knowledge Branch provides four tools to help analysts better understand the target space.
(S//SI) Mary is tasked with analyzing GSM cell phone data to locate a member of a terrorist group. James is tasked with surreptitiously accessing remote computers on an 802.11 wireless network at a terrorist site. James and Mary need cutting-edge analysis tools to be successful at their jobs....
(S//SI) Mary receives an email tipper from RETURNSPRING that a suspected terrorist's GSM phone has been found in Call Detail Record (CDR) data. She queries the RETURNSPRING database for the metadata associated with this GSM phone. The query results indicate the GSM unique cell id where the GSM phone was active. Using this information, she checks FASCIA, which provides a more comprehensive account/catalog of CDR data and coupled with other corporate systems like MAINWAY, allow her to perform target analysis. However, the CDR data does not contain exact location information for this unique cell id - the only information Mary is able to determine is the city location. Unfortunately, this is not enough. Mary needs to know specifically where this GSM phone was active.
(S//SI) Luckily, Mary is aware that a PILOTHOUSE survey has been recently conducted in this city. She uses EAGLEVIEW to process the survey data for that city and is able to see on a map an approximate location of the unique cell id. Now Mary not only knows the city location, but the approximate unique cell id location within the city! Spurred by this knowledge, she leverages corporate resources by further processing EAGLEVIEW output data using BELLVIEW and CELLFINDER. These tools allow her to perform spatial queries, access the ASSOCIATION database for target tracking, and determine the location of the cell towers.
(S//SI) What about James? He receives data gathered from several 802.11 wireless surveys conducted in the vicinity of a terrorist site. Although the survey packet data is voluminous, he is undaunted; he uses NETWIZ to process and filter the survey data, identify the network configuration, and determine the general location of access points. Next, James uses SOFFITPORT's services to determine where to place an implant in the target space and where to place a listening post. SOFFITPORT even helps James determine the optimal power-level for the implant! Armed with this data, James' office reviews the plan, then decides to implement the exploitation solution.
(S//SI) Two different scenarios, but one common thread: each requires a raw-data processing tool or service to meet operational needs and increase the probability of mission success. The Target Knowledge Branch (TKB - S32233) provides four capabilities that help civilian and military analysts better understand the target space and successfully implement reconnaissance missions.

- EAGLEVIEW_pre-processes raw GSM survey data files generated by COTS front-end collection devices like TETLEY and NEMO/PILOTHOUSE. Recently, an enhanced version was released that features a GIS viewer and the ability to overlay CADRG maps to enhance data visualization.
- NETWIZ is the latest release of the DRAGONVIEW project client. Analysts use NETWIZ to analyze wireless network data from several SIGINT collection systems, displaying both the logical and physical views of collected 802.11 data.
- RETURNSPRING processes metadata from SIGINT collection systems and TAO Bridging
Missions for the purpose of display and analysis. It ensures that valuable target data is made available and stored in corporate agency systems and in some cases, in TKB's databases.

- SOFFITPORT provides services supporting geolocation and the selection and placement of RF data-bridging devices. SOFFITPORT can be used to model the target environment based on customer specifications and to determine the best locations for transmitters and receivers.
(S//SI) If you are interested in using any of these capabilities for your mission, or if you'd simply like to learn more, go to the TKB website ("go tkbranch" or
