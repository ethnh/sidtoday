(U//FOUO) Readers had their own memories of Mr. $\square$ career, as prompted by the article "THEN vs NOW: How Being an IA Has Changed in the Past (Almost) Half Century"

(C) Frenchie was a good choice for an analyst interview. He is friendly and outgoing, and unconventional to boot. He has an excellent attitude for helping out, and is hardworking. I first met him when I as a COMINTer working in ELINT spaces more than 15 years ago, and he was kind enough to take me under his wing and teach me some of the ropes of what is now Office of Weapons and Space.
(U//FOUO) As an example of his flexibility and eccentricity, most recently we had a class together where role playing took place. Frenchie stepped up gallantly to undertake the role of Jacques Chirac in an exercise where the UN was mediating with several countries regarding nuclear power in Iran. In the scenario, Israel was going to bomb Tehran, and other major powers were trying to intervene (pretty much without success). The UN hadn't yet entered the picture. I played Kofi Annan and lead more than 50 UN role players. The name of the young man who played Blair, I've forgotten, but Frenchie, myself and the young man formed a triad to negotiate Iran's way out of being bombed with a great deal of coordination from the UN role players.

(S//SI) I am sure Frenchie's memoir stirs mostly fond memories of our analog era. What's fascinating to me is that many of the Russian air defense-related PROFORMA datalinks he broke ground on are still in use by "CCCP" clients! G001Y (SWAMP), noted in VINTAGE HARVEST as first heard in 01NOV55, is routinely collected from Syria. I happily imagine the Syrian ADZ maintainers scrounging for parts...
(U) An example of both an amazingly robust class of sensor-enabled technology, as well as testament to a living cryptologic treasure whom I am proud to call my friend. Thanks, Frenchie!
