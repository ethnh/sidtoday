(U//FOUO) US, Allies work on the Improvised Explosive Device problem...
(U//FOUO) Intelligence analysts and engineers representing a wide range of U.S. Government and allied nation agencies attended the Joint IED Defeat Organization's (JIEDDO) Worldwide Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) Analyst Summit at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida from 23-25 May. This second summit continued work on the goals of the first IED summit. (See the 28 April 2006 SIDtoday article for an account of the first session.)
(U//FOUO) Building on the previous session, JIEDDO established five topic areas for break-out groups:

- information sharing/information architecture
- intelligence campaign plan
- science and technology
- targeting (kinetic and non-kinetic) bomb-maker networks
- information operations
(C) Accomplishments of the second IED summit included:
- a list of all known IED discussion fora, including VTCs, recurring conferences, InfoWorkSpace collaborations, etc. JIEDDO will circulate this list to all participants to enhance common understanding of the IED problem set;
- a discussion of the (200+!) worldwide IED data repositories and on-line resources, and plans to develop a single, comprehensive IED database;
- an exhaustive discussion of the JIEDDO Intelligence Campaign Plan (ICP), including necessary additions. (The revised ICP will be issued by Sept 2006);
- a general recognition that IED reporting and research lanes in the road are not clear, which leads to confusion and duplication of effort. JIEDDO took an action to address this issue.
(U//FOUO) NSA continues to play a key role in the Counter-IED effort through a number of critical initiatives. Watch SID today for further Counter-IED developments.
