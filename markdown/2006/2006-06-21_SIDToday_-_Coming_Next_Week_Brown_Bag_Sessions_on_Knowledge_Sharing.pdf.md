(U//FOUO) Coming Next Week: Brown Bag Sessions on Knowledge Sharing

FROM: Lucia Jesus and Operation SIGINT
Run Date: 06/21/2006

What: Brown bag sessions on knowledge sharing
When: June 26 - 30, 12:00-1:00
Where: OPS2B 4118-3
Advance registration is required; see below for details.
(U) By 2010, 70\% of all federal employees will be eligible for retirement. 50\% of them will choose this option. That means a depletion of intellectual capital on the order of millions of subject matter experts. How is NSA affected and what can it do about it now?
(U//FOUO) Developing people, processes, technology and organizational learning increases NSA's return on investment. For example, at CIA, collaboration tools such as wikis and blogs, are used to build knowledge repositories to ensure future mission success. They have over 10,000 hyper-linked wikis and over 1000 bloggers. However, knowledge management is more than just tools and technically enabling databases. It connects those with positive voices and focuses on solutions and those who are truly committed to their profession, their mission and their organization.
(U//FOUO) OpSIGINT will host a series of brown bag sessions at Knowledge Sharing Awareness Week from June 26-30, 2006. Our invited speakers will be:

- Dr. Calvin Andrus, the Chief Technical Officer of Mission Innovation at CIA, who will speak about knowledge management and its impact on preserving critical knowledge for mission needs, and
- Jeanne Holm, Chief Knowledge Management Architect at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who will recount how their rapid response knowledge management system was used during times of crisis and tragedy, such as the Challenger and Columbia disasters.

OpSIGINT speakers will run demonstrations on tools readily available at NSA for knowledge capture and transfer, and share knowledge management best-practices available here at NSA that will ensure the future viability of NSA's precious treasure: knowledge.
