(U//FOUO) Unusual happenings in Alaska: SIGINT linguists do the speaking, rather than the listening...
(S//SI) On 14 March of this year, US Air Force units in Alaska received a transmission that appeared to be coming from a foreign aircraft. The speaker announced, in Russian, his intention to defect to the United States. Surprised military commanders quickly contacted the Alaska Mission Operations Center (AMOC), and arranged for one of the Center's Russian linguists to serve as a real-time interpreter. Meanwhile, F-15 Eagles were scrambled to intercept the alien aircraft. What the commanders didn't know at the time was that the entire event was part of a no-notice, live-fly* exercise, and that the "defector" was, in fact, a second Russian linguist from the AMOC!
(S//SI) The exercise played out like this: Once the battle staff determined that the foreign aircraft's intentions were peaceful, a message was immediately relayed to the F-15 Eagles that were already airborne and in the vicinity of the defecting aircraft. The "defector" was subsequently escorted to a safe landing in Anchorage, Alaska and potential hostilities were successfully averted.
(S//SI) The live-fly exercise provided realistic homeland defense training for Air Force and Aerospace Defense commands* in the region. A week later, on 21 March 2006, two additional AMOC linguists participated in the same scenario conducted in similar fashion. All were praised by Alaskan Command senior leadership for their professionalism and for their special skills, which brought a sense of realism to the exercises.
(S//SI) With these recent successes, there is no doubt that Alaskan Air Force and Air Defense units will continue to call on SIGINTers at the AMOC for outstanding exercise support.
(U) Notes:
*A "live-fly" exercise involves aircraft actually flying - as opposed to a "paper" exercise, in which all activity is simulated.
**These commands consisted of the Eleventh Air Force (11 AF), the Alaskan Command (ALCOM), and the Alaskan North American Aerospace Defense (ANR) Command.
