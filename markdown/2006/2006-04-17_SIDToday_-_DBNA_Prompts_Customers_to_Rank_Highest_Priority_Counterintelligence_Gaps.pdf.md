(C//REL) DBNA Prompts Customers to Rank Highest Priority Counterintelligence Gaps

(U//FOUO) Decision-Based Needs Assessment (DBNA) is a process that captures intelligence needs and determines critical gaps in the SIGINT response. It is a "cleanslate" approach that allows customers to state their needs without reference to formal Information Needs. After discussions with customers, NSA queries the National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) to determine whether the stated needs are formally documented. The appropriate Issue Manager Team (IMT) uses the results of the analysis to develop a SIGINT strategy or an improved customer or functional support plan to close the identified gaps.
(C//REL) In June 2005, SID launched the Counterintelligence (CI) DBNA. It served as an invitation for the CI community to directly shape the United States Cryptologic System (USCS) CI strategy. NSA assembled a team with representatives from:

- S11 (Customer Gateway),
- S17 (Strategic Intelligence Issues),
- S2D (Counterintelligence and HUMINT Support), and
- the NSA CI Center.

The CI Community provided input on their information needs and critical intelligence gaps related to decisions or actions expected over the next 18-24 months.
(C//REL) The Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive (NCIX) hosted a National CI Collection Working Group Off-Site from 7-9 March 2006. During this off-site, participating members voted on the highest priority CI gaps, resulting in a consensus from the CI Community on a worldwide-prioritized ranking of those gaps.
(S//REL) Community participants provided positive feedback at the conclusion of the off-site. Subsequently, the feedback endorsing the final outcome of the voting was provided to NCIX and the Europe/Russia/Africa IMT. The IMT will take the results and incorporate them into the creation of the USCS CI strategy.
(S//REL) The Requirements Analysis Center (S114), which facilitates the DBNA process in conjunction with the IMT, believes that the approach used for the CI DBNA will serve as a model for the future. The process will be further tested with upcoming DBNAs on Iran and Space Situational Awareness. Stay tuned for more information.
