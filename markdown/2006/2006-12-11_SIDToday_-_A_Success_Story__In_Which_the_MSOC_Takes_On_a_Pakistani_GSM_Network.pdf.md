(TS//SI//REL) A Success Story, In Which the MSOC Takes On a Pakistani GSM Network

(S//SI//REL) The New Mission Development Center (NMDC) within the Misawa Security Operations Center (MSOC) created a brand new mission for the site, resulting in improved coverage of international terrorist and trans-Asia targets.
(S//REL) This is a story about Misawa's New Mission Development Center (NMDC), which is one of several that extend the mission of the SIGDEV Strategy and Governance (SSG) organization around the world.
(S//REL) Misawa's NMDC has four branches: a Signals Development Center (SDC); a Network Analysis Center (NAC); a Target Analysis Center (TAC) and a System Development Branch.

(TS//SI//REL) In March 2006, SDC analysts identified two GSM 1 infrastructure links carried over the Chinastar-1 satellite. Processing these signals briefly through a recently acquired developmental JUGGERNAUT system revealed the links were in use by a Pakistani operator. A longer look produced Priority 2 and 3 telephone calls, which prompted the NMDC to keep the links on developmental collection and perform more analytical work to determine the relative value.
(TS//SI//REL) The NMDC System Development Branch continued surveying Chinastar-1, identified ten additional signals carrying Pakistani GSM links and placed six of these on developmental collection.
(S//SI//REL) The TAC further analyzed the links and engaged S2I (Counterterrorism) to assess their value. S2I determined the links served the Karachi area.
(TS//SI//REL) Because the NMDC identified the signals of interest and informed the appropriate target offices, the MSOC received sustained tasking for these signals in April from S2I11 (al-Qa'ida Senior Leadership Branch). FORNSAT Planning (S33121) had proactively installed two JUGGERNAUT systems in LADYLOVE, Misawa's sustained mission area, but they lacked the modems necessary to take over collection from the NMDC. Both the NMDC and LADYLOVE engaged FORNSAT Planning and Collection Management (S33123) branches to rectify the capability gap. In June, FORNSAT Planning provided additional modems to enable the collection of the GSM carriers. After the installation of the new equipment in July, the collection of the Pakistani links moved from

the NMDC to LADYLOVE.
(TS//SI//REL) Since then, the NMDC has identified and added to sustained collection six more Pakistani GSM infrastructure links--a total of fourteen. These provide sole-source collection of the infrastructure links for various GSM providers and enable development and reporting on al-Qaeda senior leadership, which primarily uses GSM and C2C ${ }^{2}$ modes of communication.
(U//FOUO) So it was that Misawa's NMDC discovered an important new target and drove the creation of a new mission capability.
