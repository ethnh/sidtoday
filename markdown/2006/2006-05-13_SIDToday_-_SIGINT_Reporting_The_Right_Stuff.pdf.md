# (U) SIGINT Reporting: The Right Stuff

## (U//FOUO) Finding the balance between reporting facts and insights.

(U//FOUO) One of the major themes emerging from this month's analysis conference was the need for our analysts to share their professional insights. Why? Simply put, because customers find them invaluable... and ultimately, they contribute to making our nation a more secure place. It is no longer enough to publish a SIGINT report that lets the SIGINT fact speak for itself, when professional amplification or judgment can add value.
(U//FOUO) With this in mind, NSA leadership has for some time encouraged our analysts to insert their expertise and insights into our SIGINT reporting -- in other words, to do more assessment reporting. I should clarify that by "assessment reporting" I'm not talking about only official Assessment Reports -- I'm referring to SIGINT reports of ANY kind that include analytic insights.
(U//FOUO) It is difficult in daily analysis and reporting to find the right balance between reporting facts and providing insights, given the volume, velocity and variety of SIGINT that we deal with. Meeting customer requirements is demanding on its own. Using resources to their maximum capability and capacity, efficiently and effectively is one of the great challenges of any manager.
(U//FOUO) Now is a good time to consider how well we are doing in this regard... How frequently we are producing intelligence consisting of more than just the facts? Are we defining intelligence based on old models or are we being responsive to customers and their Intelligence Needs?
(U//FOUO) Recently, $\square$ showed me a sample study on the SIGINT reports going out to customers, indicating that only about $25 \%$ of the reports released in 2005 included more than the explanation and description of SIGINT facts. (See related article .) Looking at those numbers, I'd like to explore ways to increase the level of analytic commentary making its way into our reports.
(U//FOUO) I want to know what your thoughts are, and have asked $\square$ to collate them. Please email him your perspectives ( $\square$ ) or post them on the SID today blog:

(U//FOUO) This is an important topic for A\&P, and I very much look forward to hearing what you have to say.
