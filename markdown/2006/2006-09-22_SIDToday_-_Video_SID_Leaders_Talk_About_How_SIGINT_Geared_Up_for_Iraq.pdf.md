Operation SIGINT
Run Date: 09/22/2006
(U/FOUO) The first of a series of video interviews with SID leaders is now ready for viewing! The topic of the interview? Former Deputy Director of SID, Charlie Meals, and current SIGINT Director MG Quirk recall the preparing, planning and orchestration of efforts and events leading up to the invasion of Iraq 2003.
(S//SI) According to Charlie Meals, this was one of the most successful SIGINT operations and is rich in lessons that should be captured and shared. MG Quirk lives up to his reputation as a great storyteller when he highlights the creation and evolution of the Iraq Issue Management Team (IMT), the coordination of the Rock Drills and the unprecedented customer support that was established.
(U//FOUO) This short, 30 minute video-capture serves as a primer for a series of video-captures that will drill down further in exploring those components that made the SIGINT support to operations such a success. Here's the link:
