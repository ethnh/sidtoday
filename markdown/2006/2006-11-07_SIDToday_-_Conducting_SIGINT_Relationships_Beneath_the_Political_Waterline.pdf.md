(S//SI//REL) Conducting SIGINT Relationships Beneath the Political Waterline

(S//SI//REL) Third Party SIGINT organizations sometimes prefer to keep quiet about their SIGINT ties to NSA.
(S//SI//REL) The fall of Saigon in 1975 had impact far beyond Vietnamese borders. In Thailand, the US operated a large SIGINT facility in Ramasan, but after a sudden change in administration -- very much like the recent coup in Bangkok -- the Thai government developed drastically new policies, and the US was told to withdraw all its military forces in Thailand by March 1976. This included the closure of the US SIGINT base.
(S//SI//REL) At the same time, the US had been formulating a proposal to expand the Thai Third Party relationship to include coverage of Southeast Asian communist communications, but that plan was put in abeyance while both sides assessed the impact of the new Thai government policies. In the end, both sides opted to continue to expand the relationship, with the Thai side desiring to keep its newly expanded role out of the political limelight. Even to this day, the Thai are sensitive about exposing the SIGINT relationship to their political masters for fear of a politically driven reaction.
(S//SI//REL) Conducting SIGINT relationships beneath the political waterline has become a way of doing business for many partnerships.
