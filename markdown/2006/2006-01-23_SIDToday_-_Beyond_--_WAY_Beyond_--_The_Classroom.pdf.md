(S//SI) Two NSA Global Network Interns experience a fascinating 4-month tour in Iraq.
(S//SI) The war in Iraq has brought many vivid images into our homes eliciting all kinds of emotions. One of the most poignant ones was of a wounded medic, whose first action after checking for the welfare of his comrades, was to provide medical help to the very same man who inflicted his wounds. This incredible act of professionalism inspired the awe and admiration of viewers everywhere and was made possible though the efforts of two young men in NSA's GNEVA (Global Network Exploitation and Vulnerability Analyst) Development Program ( GDP ) while on a 120-day tour in Baghdad.
(S//SI) 2003 graduate of the
U//FOUO) graduate of the
videos while performing their duties of "disambiguating the good guys from the bad guys" for the Joint Document Exploitation Center in Baghdad. How did it transpire that the footage was in a video belonging to one of these "bad guys"? When US soldiers captured the insurgent who had fired on the medic, they found a Sony Handy Cam mounted on his rifle; the man had intended to use the footage for propaganda and training purposes.
(U//FOUO) Both NSA interns felt that all the people they worked with (military, government civilians, and contractors) were extraordinarily professional and devoted to the mission. They also felt privileged to be working with Iraqis, who exhibited a high level of patriotism and justified pride in the past achievements of their country. $\square$ firmly believe that "some day Iraq could be an amazing place to visit" and, they noted, there are many people working hard together to see that day come.
(U//FOUO) It was apparent that the impact this tour had on the interns was a positive one but, they insist, there has not been a bad tour yet. "The program is excellent," stated, "and the administrators of the program definitely stand behind us." $\square$ added that the exposure to other elements of the Intelligence Community received during his tour provided an education "you could not receive from reading or spending a lifetime at NSA-W."
(U//FOUO) Both and will graduate from the GDP in 2007 and, while it is not clear where they will apply their talents after that, it is obvious that the experience they gained from this program will enable them to tackle any challenge with skill and confidence.
