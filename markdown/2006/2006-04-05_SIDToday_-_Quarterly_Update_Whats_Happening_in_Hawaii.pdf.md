# (U) NSA/CSS Hawaii Participates in BALIKATAN 06 

(U) The NSA/CSS Hawaii performed a leading role in the success of BALIKATAN (BK) 06 which was conducted from 12 February to 10 March, 2006. BALIKATAN is the annual, combined bilateral exercise between the U.S. and Republic of the Philippines. U.S. and Republic of the Philippines Armed Forces combined to conduct Humanitarian/Civic Assistance (H/CA) projects, and a field training exercise with live-fire portion. The primary SIGINT support focus areas for BK 06 were force protection and Counterterrorism (CT) target access and development.
(S//SI) NSAH provided Direct SIGINT Support to BK operations by establishing a limitedduration Crisis Action Center (CAC) which managed six Target Pursuit Teams (TPT) and coordinated efforts from Special Collection Service (SCS) Manila. During the exercise, the CAC and the supporting SIGINT teams processed over 138 million call events, including over 500 associated with High Value Targets (HVTs) and more than 20,000 associated with priorityinterest individuals. These efforts also resulted in 35 Force Protection tippers, two of which alerted supported U.S commanders of HVT's operating within 2KM of their (CJTF) positions.
(S//SI) The concept of SIGINT support operations for BK 06 was an evolved fusion from the "Mosul model" (see a previous SID today article for background) tailored to fit the Pacific regional GWOT (Global War on Terrorism) challenges. Central to this was the deployment of the Quadra-Spectre technology - the first in the Asia / Pacific region. By emphasizing near real-time synchronized collection, automated processing and correlation of national/tactical data Quadra Spectre realized an overall 37\% increase in target event collection. Target analysts estimate that the Quadra-Spectre deployment resulted in an overall $60 \%$ increase in knowledge of the GSM signals environment on Jolo Island alone.

## (U//FOUO) HIGHCASTLE

(U//FOUO) The NSA/CSS Hawaii has completed the HIGHCASTLE (HC) Information Technology infrastructure modernization. The installation was completed in late February 06 and has resulted in conditional acceptance by the site. Resolution of ONEROOF Digital Audio System interoperability issues continues.
