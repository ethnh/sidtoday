# Course Overview: 

(S) The current frozen conflicts in Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, and Transnistria, as well as the recently resolved conflict in Ajaria; while originating from the internal desire on the part of indigenous populations to manage their own affairs, have been exacerbated by the post-Cold War Machiavellian attempts by Russia to maintain its imperial influence in the former Soviet territory. This seminar will focus on the origins of these conflicts, the effect of Russia's meddling, the current state of affairs, and the prospects for resolution.
