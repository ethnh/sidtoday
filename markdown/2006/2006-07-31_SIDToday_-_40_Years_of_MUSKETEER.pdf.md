(C) MUSKETEERs deploy on special collection and survey missions. Events will be held to mark a major milestone that was reached this year...
(C) For the past 40 years MUSKETEER, the Special Deployments Division (S3161), has provided valuable SIGINT products and services for a myriad of customers both internal and external to NSA. In recognition of this momentous occasion, MUSKETEER will be celebrating its 40th Anniversary this September with a series of events, including a cake cutting ceremony as well as an open house consisting of tours and briefings. For the latest updates and to register for events, go to the MUSKETEER 40th Anniversary webpage .

## (U) Origins

(C) In 1966 the cover term "WEREWOLF" was identified for a newly formed project, tasked to address technical ELINT characterization shortfalls. Fortunately, the original chief decided on a name further down the generated list of hopefuls and "MUSKETEER" was born. At around the same time that the minimum wage in the U.S. rose to a whole dollar, soon-to-be MUSKETEERs were performing collection and analysis of an ELINT target that was reported as exhibiting parameters outside of normal operating conditions. Analysis revealed that the collection equipment was inducing the signal anomaly. The problem was corrected and future development efforts were redirected.
(C) Out of this mission grew the "niche" function and naming of the first MUSKETEER project, known as ALPHA. It was initially assumed that there would be, at most, 26 missions of this type, therefore the use of the phonetic alphabet for a naming scheme seemed appropriate. Fortunately for the MUSKETEER organization, the mission requirements kept on coming.

## (U) Added Responsibilities

(C) In 1991, MUSKETEER's ELINT focus changed when the COMINT-based CAVALIER program merged into MUSKETEER during a major W-Group reorganization. This new partnership enabled the expansion of MUSKETEER's enhanced collection and survey operations to include both ELINT and COMINT.

## (U) Accomplishments

(TS//SI) For over 40 years, MUSKETEER's accomplishments have spanned the global SIGINT spectrum, ranging from direct support to the Warfighter to force protection to Third Party assistance in the successful takedown of terrorist cells. During the Balkans conflict, MUSKETEER analysis and evaluation of vulnerabilities in the SA-6 surface-to-air weapons system resulted in the neutralization of multiple batteries by U.S. Navy fighter aircraft. While deployed to the Philippines, MUSKETEER prosecution of communications resulted in a foiled assassination attempt on the JTF-510 commander. More recently, data collected by a MUSKETEER survey team enabled the host government partner to arrest a terrorist cell while the team was still conducting operations.

## (U) Staying Relevant

(U) Throughout our agency's history, organizations have been created and disbanded in accordance with changing times and missions. It is said that if an organization doesn't maintain relevancy, it is destined for oblivion. Obviously, transformation is the key to productivity and survival in the corporate world and government alike.
(C) Over the past 40 years and hundreds of missions beyond the initial estimate of 26, MUSKETEER has maintained a changing culture. This state of readiness and ability to respond to the ever-changing tide of world events are what allows our workforce to continue the traditions established by MUSKETEER founders in the 1960s. Though the people have changed in the last 40 years and the target sets have evolved in both technologies and collection locations, one thing has remained the same as evidenced by MUSKETEER's credo:
" Any Target, Anywhere, Any Time "
