(U//FOUO) SID Office Wins Prestigious Safety and Health Award FROM: $\square$
Environmental and Safety Services (ME6)
Run Date: 06/13/2006
(U//FOUO) In April 2006, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) recommended the Special Services Division of the Office of Target Reconnaissance and Survey (S316) its highest mark - the Voluntary Protection Program STAR Site award.
(U) OSHA's VPP STAR Site Award identifies world-class safety and health management systems, as determined by a rigorous on-site OSHA evaluation. Out of more than 7 million eligible work sites, S3163 is one of only 1,461 sites throughout the nation to be nominated for this prestigious designation (and only the second in the Intelligence Community to do so), putting S3163 in the top 1/1000th of 1 percent for excellence in safety. The recognition represents some key benchmarks:

- first-ever recognition of this type by any office in Data Acquisition (S3)
- SSD is only the second Intelligence Community organization to be recognized by VPP in its history (I62's Special Projects Lab is the other NSA VPP site).
- OTRS SSD is one of only nine US Government entities recognized among 1,461 VPPranked businesses nationwide since the program inception in 1982.
(U//FOUO) OSHA VPP evaluation team leader, commended SSD's management and employees for an outstanding 3-year safety record of zero work-related illnesses and injuries. He said that SSD's STAR rating was a testament to the attitude and commitment of the SSD staff and the support of SSD and OTRS management to integrate safety/health as a key value of operational culture.
(U//FOUO) $\square$ chief of OTRS, further cited the invaluable work of the SSD program by $\square$ ME6 safety specialist, to support the OTRS SSD VPP. He also congratulated $\square$ chief, and the entire S3163 team, for its initiative to pursue VPP recognition. Such effort, he noted, is a key example of the DIRNSA's emphasis on people as a most valuable mission resource.
(U//FOUO) Given the thoroughness of the SSD program preparation and evaluation results, the final written report should be prepared and approved within the next few weeks. Once approved by the Assistant Secretary of Labor, there will be an awards ceremony at NSA in approximately $2-3$ months.
(U) Congratulations to the S3163 workforce for this incredible achievement and to OHESS and the S3163 management team for their support in this effort.
(U//FOUO) POC: $\square$, Chief, S3163 $\square$ s/ $\square$ b)
