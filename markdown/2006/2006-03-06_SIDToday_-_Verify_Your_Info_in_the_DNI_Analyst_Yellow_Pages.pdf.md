FROM:
S01 Dancehall Team Lead
Run Date: 03/06/2006
(U//FOUO) Recently, the Director of National Intelligence announced the unveiling of the "Analysts Yellow Pages" (see DNI message ).
(U//FOUO) If you are an analyst, check out the following Intelink site to see your information in the Yellow Pages (you will need your PKI certificate, and remember to activate your VPN Dialer):
(U//FOUO) Verify your information, and if it isn't correct, the Analytic Resources Catalog (ARC) will let you correct it online for a short time. The data will then be sent back to NSA via the Dancehall Team.
(U//FOUO) How does the ARC get the information on the analysts in the first place? Remember the 6-month data-calls in which the DANCEHALL Team asks you to enter or update your skills profile in DANCEHALL database? (See related article .) Well, those skills profiles are what is populating the ARC Yellow Pages. The fields that are being used are the three National Intelligence Priority Framework Topics (NIPF) fields and your contact information.
(U//FOUO) If you wish to provide feedback about the ARC Yellow Pages, contact NSA's POC, There will be more information coming as more analysts test the tool. We will also be setting up demos, etc. Stay tuned for more on the ARC Yellow Pages.
