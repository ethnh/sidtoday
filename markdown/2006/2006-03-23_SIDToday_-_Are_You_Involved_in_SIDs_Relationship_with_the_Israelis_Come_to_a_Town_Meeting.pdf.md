(TS//SI) Are You Involved in SID's Relationship with the Israelis? Come to a Town Meeting

FROM: Rick Ledgett
Acting Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3)
Run Date: 03/23/2006

What: Town meeting for those involved in the SID - ISNU relationship When: 29 March, 0900-1030
Where: Friedman Auditorium
(TS//SI) In late February a group of SID and FAD leaders travelled to Tel Aviv to meet with counterparts in the Israeli SIGINT National Unit (ISNU). I participated in my corporate role as the SID coordinator for the relationship with ISNU. It was a fruitful exchange that will yield greater cooperation focused on common national goals.
(TS//SI) In the interests of briefing you about the strategy that was developed, as well as to discuss with you the implications for SID's relationship with the Israelis and to propose a way ahead for both our organizations, there will be a Town Meeting on 29 March, 0900-1030, in the Friedman Auditorium. All U.S., blue-badged people in SID who are currently involved in any aspect of the SID relationship with the ISNU are requested to attend the Town Meeting.
(TS//SI) Colleagues from the Foreign Affairs Directorate, to include our SIGINT Liaison Officer to Israel, will be at the Town Meeting to help answer any questions you might have. We look forward to seeing you there!
