(U) A Great Place to Work

(U) Managers, have you considered the factors that add up to a great work environment?
(U) We've all known about the great places to work in regards to exotic locations, or the "once-in-a-lifetime" career-enhancing tour of duty. However, there are other enriching aspects that make for a great place to work. First, it must be understood that a great place to work is totally different from a good place to work. A great place to work is where employees enjoy working hard together as a team. Teamwork prevails with grace and excellence even under the pressure of a crisis. Impossible?
(U) A great place to work may indeed seem impossible. In fact, the new employee would be inclined to scope, with leery eyes, for any undertones of backbiting, complaining, or favoritism, but as time passes; a skeptic discovers there are no signs of dysfunction. Conversely, it is the respectful interactions, diligent helping hands, and never-ending humor that separate the good from the great place to work. The pleasant office dynamics actually encourages newly assigned employees to go with the flow!
(U) Where is this place? A great place to work is easy to recognize. A common sentiment sadly echoes from departing employees, "This was the best office I've ever worked in." Many simply would not want to leave; even the forward deployed! The secretly envious wait patiently for an opportunity to serve, while others would boldly question, "Are there any vacancies!?" Routine visitors would whisper to one another, "They always get along so well." Customers often esteem the work ethic, while peer organizations would seek to discover the office's best practices.
(U) A great place to work is well organized. No one says, "That's not my job." The office is too busy to accommodate strife, jealousy, or turf battles. All employees are important and celebrated. No one is criticized. Instead, employees highly respect one another and encourage one another. In a great place, it's all in a day's work.
