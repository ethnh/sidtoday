(U) How to Change the Intelligence Community Without Leaving Your Desk!

(U//FOUO) By now most of you have received and deleted the message from the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the Hon. John D. Negroponte, announcing the "Release of the NIS [National Intelligence Strategy] Implementation Plans," no doubt thinking "What do these plans have to do with me and my job?" The short answer is that at least a portion of these plans will affect the work you are performing in SID.
(U//FOUO) Background: Last year the DNI produced his NIS as the overarching strategic document for the Intelligence Community (IC). This strategy consisted of five Mission Objectives (MO) focused on the major classes of missions of the IC and ten Enterprise Objectives (EO) focused on the management, effectiveness, and efficiency of the IC. Objective owners on the DNI staff have been expanding each Objective with specific goals, actions, and initiatives to achieve the Objective. In his recent message DNI announced the completion and publication of the implementation plans for the Objectives.
(U//FOUO) "Why do I care?" Even if you are not fascinated by strategic planning and the big picture, there are three broad reasons why you should take the time to look at the implementation plans that apply to your mission, career field, expertise, or interest:

1. These plans provide a high-level view of the direction of the IC -- useful because NSA/CSS will be going in the same direction. The performance plans will give you a larger framework for understanding the changes and requirements that will affect the work you do.
2. These implementation plans offer you a wide array of opportunities -- useful if you want to expand your career and horizons by working on technical and subject-matter groups and projects beyond NSA/CSS. Experience with these groups will be helpful throughout your career and may lead to a tour in another element of the IC.
3. These plans will provide new tools and techniques -- useful in enhancing your productivity and support to the missions of NSA/CSS.
