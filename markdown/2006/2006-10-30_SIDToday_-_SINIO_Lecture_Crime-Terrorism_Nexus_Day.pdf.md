(S) Terrorism remains a critical concern to the United States Government. While many aspects of the terrorism issue are well known, there are some features that we do not fully understand or appreciate. One of these aspects is the crime-terrorism nexus. The speakers will discuss the purported links between terrorists and transnational criminal syndicates and networks as well as drug trafficking organizations. There also will be a presentation of the alleged nexus from the perspective of senior terrorist expert. This seminar will be open only to U.S. persons.
