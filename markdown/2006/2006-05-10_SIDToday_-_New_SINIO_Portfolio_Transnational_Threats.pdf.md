(C) New SINIO Portfolio: Transnational Threats

FROM:
SINIO for Transnational Threats (S17)
Run Date: 05/10/2006
(C) The new Transnational Threats portfolio represents a merger of the SINIO/Counterterrorism and SINIO/Crime \& Narcotics portfolios.
(C) Among the wide variety of transnational threats facing the United States, the Intelligence Community (IC) has long recognized a level of connection between terrorists and drug traffickers, alien smugglers and transnational criminal syndicates and networks. While the extent of these connections remains a matter of discussion, it is increasingly difficult to focus on terrorist entities without reference to the extra-legal groups which help facilitate terrorist activities through funding, the provision of false documentation, and travel.
(C) Indeed, the recognition of these connections prompted the National Intelligence Council (NIC) in early 2004 to establish the position of National Intelligence Officer (NIO) for Transnational Threats. The NIO/TNT is responsible to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) for over-the-horizon analysis of how foreign terrorism emerges, behaves, and threatens US interests, as well as for homeland security, drug trafficking, and organized crime issues.
(C) In recognition of the potential benefits of this construct, the Chief of NSA's Strategic Intelligence Issues Office (S17), Dr David Shore, recently announced the merger of two SIGINT National Intelligence Officer (SINIO) portfolios -- Counterterrorism and Crime \& Narcotics -- into a new Transnational Threats (TNT) portfolio. This new team, comprising a SINIO and three Deputies, will immediately begin serving as DIRNSA's representatives to the IC for strategic issues related to:

- Terrorism,
- Transnational Criminal Syndicates and Networks,
- International Drug Trafficking,
- Illicit Finance,
- Worldwide Alien Smuggling, and
- Human Trafficking.

A key part of the SINIO/TNT's responsibilities will be to ensure a robust analytic exchange between external customers/partners and the appropriate analytic elements at NSA and in the Extended Enterprise.
