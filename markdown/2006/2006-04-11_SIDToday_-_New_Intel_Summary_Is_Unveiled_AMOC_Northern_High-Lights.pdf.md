(U) New Intel Summary Is Unveiled: 'AMOC Northern High-Lights'

(S) The Alaska Mission Operations Center (AMOC) launched the first two editions of a new SIGINT assessment product, dubbed the "AMOC Northern High-Lights." This unserialized intelligence summary enabled the site's fusion analysts to take a closer look at some of the hottest issues from recent Russian military aviation operations; issues that more standard/formal SIGINT reporting often fails to fully exploit. Providing more context and background information, as well as more space for the team's analytical assessments, the "SIGINT Highlights" quickly emerged as a customer-friendly product that could facilitate intelligence exchanges from PACAF (Pacific Air Forces) to USAFE (US Air Forces in Europe), initiating valuable dialogue on the Russian target set.
(S//SI) Early editions of the "Northern High-Lights" included:

- articles on increased Tu-95/BEAR-H training activity,
- rarely seen TU-22MR/BACKFIRE Intelligence Collection Flights against Japan,
- alleged AN-72/COALER border violations against Japan, and
- new trends in Su-24/FENCER tactical training activity.
(S//SI) All of these events had previously been reported on the AMOC operations floor through standard SIGINT processes. Yet the "Northern High-Lights" articles did not stop at answering the standard, what happened when? Instead, they went on to ask, why? And what do we assess this to mean? To further refine the value of this product and explore possibilities for others, the AMOC is engaged with S2's new SIGINT Assessment Cell to help develop new forms of highquality, non-traditional intelligence reports for our SIGINT customers worldwide.
(S) The "Northern High-Lights" has already helped facilitate healthy discussions among Alaskan intelligence organizations focused on giving theater commanders predictive intelligence on Russian intentions to deploy strategic aviation assets to their forward staging bases. The collaborative effort sparked by the "Northern High-Lights" has already lead to the assessment that Russian deployment activity is undergoing fundamental changes and thus our indicators must begin to change as well - but that is a topic to be discussed (in far greater detail) in the next edition of the "Northern High-Lights."
