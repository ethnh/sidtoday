(U) With the Independence Day holiday just around the corner, SID today would like to post some anecdotes from the workforce regarding their most memorable 4th of July celebrations.
(U//FOUO) Last year, we asked employees to send in their stories of being overseas on the 4th, and had a great response. (See part 1 and part 2 .)
(U) For this year, we invite you to send in your "memorable 4th" stories, no matter where they occurred. If we get enough submissions, we'll post them as an article. Send your input to nsa. Looking forward to hearing from you!
