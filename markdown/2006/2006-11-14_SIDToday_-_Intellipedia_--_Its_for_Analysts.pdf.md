(U//FOUO) Intellipedia -- It's for Analysts
FROM
Customer Gateway (S11)
Run Date: $11 / 14 / 2006$
(C//REL) Intellipedia is an Intelligence Community-wide wiki for analysts - a collaboration tool that allows content on intelligence targets to be edited by anyone. It is available on all the versions of INTELINK, i.e. INTELINK-TS, INTELINK-S and INTELINK-SBU. Currently, only about 20 registered users of Intellipedia are from NSA, the smallest of any of the big IC Agencies. CIA has more than 200 registered users and is leading the charge. CIA is so serious they are offering a 6-day "sabbatical" that introduces CIA analysts to the new collaborative capabilities on INTELINK. Intellipedia is available at: Intellipedia main page .
(TS//SI//REL) Intellipedia is a great place to collaborate and to share what is known about intelligence targets. NSA's wiki tends toward cryptologic articles, but Intellipedia is focused on intelligence sharing on broad intelligence topics. Some current articles in the Breaking Events section on the INTELINK-TS Intellipedia include:

- the North Korean announcement of a nuclear test,
- the murder of Russian journalist, Anna Politkovskaya, and
- rumor-control over the reported death of Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Sistani.

There's even a whole category of links to Intelligence Gaps. In short, there's something for everyone.

# (C//REL) Also Available: INTELINK Instant Messager and INTELINK Blog 

(C//REL) Intellipedia is part of the larger transformation of INTELINK. Along with Intellipedia, the INTELINK folks have provided two other key tools that are designed to bring analysts together. All of them are available to NSAers (US citizens only). The first is Intelink Instant Messenger (IIM). This chat tool is small, easy-to-use and is accessible by NSA, CIA, NRO, NGA and other agencies. Information on how to access it from NSANet is available on INTELINK-TS at the INTELINK Instant Messaging website .
(C//REL) The second tool is INTELINK Blogs. Web logs, blogs, for short, have become a great tool for sharing your knowledge and your point-of-view with others. Distinguished from Intellipedia, which should be fact-based, INTELINK Blogs provide a forum for the discussion of "should and could," rather than "is or was." You can access the INTELINK blogs at the INTELINK blog homepage .
