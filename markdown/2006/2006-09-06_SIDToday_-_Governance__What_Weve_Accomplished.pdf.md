(U//FOUO) Governance: What We've Accomplished
FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 09/06/2006
(U//FOUO) Together, we've made great progress over the last four years, both in terms of "building out" our SIGINT System to locations worldwide and in terms of managing how that global system operates. Last year I stated that " The US SIGINT System continues to grow as a worldwide venture. As it expands, we need a thread that connects all the pieces... Governance is that thread. " Let's review what we've accomplished to date in the governance arena and consider what lies ahead.
(U//FOUO) In the last few years, we have taken the following steps to give clear and unified direction to all of our Extended Enterprise operations around the world:

- (S//SI) What are our top missions? For the first time ever, we now have a process for weighing the varied and conflicting national-level requirements levied on the SIGINT System and prioritizing them in a systematic way. This is the Mission Discernment process. The results of this process are published in our monthly Strategic Mission Lists*.
- (S//SI) How are we doing? Having settled on which missions to work through Mission Discernment, we saw a need to regularly evaluate our performance against those targets and to look for ways to improve. So, we created the Mission Assessment process. The results (i.e. how well are we doing against each target, and the prognosis) are regularly posted in Mission Assessment Briefings.*
- (S//SI) How do we distribute our available resources? The third major piece of the puzzle was the creation of a Mission Apportionment process, by which we decide how to allocate our limited resources to where they are most needed.
(U//FOUO) The above processes give us an enduring mechanism for steering the SIGINT System, but there's one area still remaining to be addressed: longer-term US Cryptologic System (USCS) planning. NSA has been working hard to put in place a Future Mission List to prioritize those strategic cryptologic missions we believe will be of greatest importance in the future, and to allow us to start now in acquiring the essential capabilities we will need if we're to be effective against emerging threats.
(U) Thanks, and Keep Up the Good Work!
(U//FOUO) As you know, I've focused much of my efforts as SIGINT Director on governance issues, and I'm convinced that the results are worth the effort. It was essential that we institutionalize a global SIGINT governance system, and many of you -- SIGINT leadership, staff and analysts - have overcome many obstacles to make this a reality. You have my sincerest thanks. I urge you to continue to improve and refine these processes as we move into the future, so that SIGINT will play an ever-more-important role in safeguarding our nation.
