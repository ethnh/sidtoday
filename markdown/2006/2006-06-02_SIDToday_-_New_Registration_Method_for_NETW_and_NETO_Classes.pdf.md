(U//FOUO) New Registration Method for NETW and NETO Classes
FROM: Deborah Maklowski
NSA/CSS Deputy Senior Intelligence Authority
Run Date: 06/02/2006
(U//FOUO) As many of you may know, most all of NSA's available training on data network operations and exploitation is provided under contract with an outside vendor. This includes nearly all the NETW and NETO courses. For analysts in SID, in the SID elements at the Cryptologic Centers, and now in NTOC*, this contract is funded by SID/Analysis and Production (A\&P).
(U//FOUO) In our desire to make sure that these A\&P training dollars were spent wisely -- i.e., making sure that the students in the courses were analysts (of whatever kind) with a demonstrable need for this kind of training -- A\&P, SID, and the National Cryptologic School had jointly devised a registration methodology that looked good on paper but, as it turned out, was confusing and didn't work too well in practice. For those of you who, over the course of the last year or so, experienced problems and frustration with this registration process, please accept our apologies. We have heard your complaints and have scrapped that method.
(U//FOUO) In the future -- which starts pretty much right now -- SID's SIGINT Mission Interface for Education and Training (S01SMI/E\&T) will send out calls each month for analysts interested in signing up for NETW and NETO classes scheduled 6 weeks out. Analysts will have two weeks to provide the registration data requested (including a justification for the training) to A\&P, which will verify analytic need and send a prioritized list of students for each class to ADET.
(U//FOUO) ADET will register the students in the Enterprise Learning Management (ELM) system, creating a wait list if necessary, and ELM will manage the course from that point. We believe this will greatly reduce the number of empty seats in each class and will solve the problem that led to classes being cancelled despite the existence of a wait list.
(U) The first of these calls, for classes scheduled to run in July 2006, should go out very shortly, so keep an eye on your email!
