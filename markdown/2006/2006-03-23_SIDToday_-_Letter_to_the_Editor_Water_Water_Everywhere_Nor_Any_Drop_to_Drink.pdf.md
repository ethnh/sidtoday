# (U//FOUO) Here are reader comments on yesterday's article A Growing Security Challenge: Competition for Water 

## Comment:

(U//FOUO) When I was TDY to Jordan in 1999, I had a fascinating conversation with some lowranking Jordanian Army officers. They described how Israel and Syria were both involved in fresh-water supply projects to Jordan, but the Israeli water was unfit for use. "Who is the true friend of Jordan?" they asked, rhetorically.
(U) My taxi driver spoke enough English to do the job (and I spoke enough Arabic to be polite), but we were unable to find a way to describe water that falls from the sky.
(U) A resident American recalled that there had been rain about six months before.
(U) Many hotels I've stayed in (US and Europe) will defer laundry of bath linens until the guest requests it, to save water and energy. (My home bath towel gets washed weekly, which is fine with me, for just the same reasons.) However, my hotel in Amman washed them every day, because that was their concept of high-class service, despite the national scarcity of water. What I saw as waste was a symbol of modernity to them.

(U) Comment:
(U) This is an excellent article. I am a recent hire from industry where I worked as a Hydrogeologist/Project Manager for an environmental consulting firm, so water issues are very familiar to me. It is no exaggeration to say it's just a matter of time until wars erupt because of competition for the resource... in fact, even the U.S. has severe water issues with multiple states in the West continuously entangled in litigation over water rights.
(U//FOUO) I think it's critical to have articles on topics that the NSA traditionally does not address (at least primarily), such as water resource issues, and the Agency should expand its efforts in monitoring resource issues.
