# (C) VoiceMatch: A New Offering at NCS 

FROM: Adolf Cusmariu
Technical Director, Operational Technologies (S202B11)
Run Date: 07/18/2006
(S//SI) Several articles this year introduced voice-matching analyses based on powerful technology recently obtained from MIT/Lincoln Laboratories; the analyses involved the voices of Bin Laden, Al-Zawahiri, Zarqawi, and other lesser-known or suspected terrorists. (See one of the earlier articles.)
(C) Due to language analyst interest, the National Cryptologic School has approved a formal short course (four hours) on practical use of MIT's tools; the designator is TOOL 2019. The course will be taught by the author, and will be based on a tutorial found at:
tutormit.html
(C) The course will be self-contained and will include some basics of the speech signal to make the technology more intuitive. Topics will include:

1. The Speech Signal
2. The WaveSurfer editing and playback tool
3. The MIT voice-matching approach
4. The Speaker Comparison Algorithm (SCA) tool
5. Model building in the Trainer
6. The Speaker Watchlist Tool (SWT)
7. Language-independent features
8. Error sources
9. Tricks-of-the-trade

Students will have MIT's tools loaded on their desktop PC's at the NCS, together with a voice database for comparison and testing. An atmosphere of experimentation and discovery will be fostered.
(C) In order to give us a better idea how many plan to sign up for this course, please contact either the author (www.mit.org) or the NCS's (www.necs.com) and let us know of your interest.
