(U) Please join us on October 4th, 2006 for Democracy: The Noble Experiment , a day-long seminar focused on current issues in democracy promotion.
(U) This seminar will explore some of the pillars of a liberal democracy. As the United States is vigorously engaged in all corners of the globe, expanding the worldwide community of democracies is a key objective of U.S. foreign policy to ensure our security, future peace, and prosperity. Yet, there is significant debate as to how best to effect meaningful, democratic change.
(U) Topics addressed in this seminar will include:

- the cycle of conflict and reconstruction issues;
- elections and political participation;
- the rise of civil society; and
- nationalism and national identity.

Speakers from inside and outside the government will discuss how these aspects are critical to the formation and sustainability of democracy, as well as the challenges and obstacles to implementation.
(U) To enroll in the seminar (AREA 1800), please visit the NCS webpage ("Go NCS") or contact Roland Recker at www.necs.org or www.necs.org We look forward to seeing you at what promises to be a thought-provoking day!
