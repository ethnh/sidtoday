(U) SID Slightly Over-Strength

(U) Here's a question that came into the SID Mailbag regarding SID's staffing levels...

Question: (U) In looking for a new job, I noticed that all the HQ vacancy announcements are prefaced with "Due to the status of SID manning, only NSA civilians currently assigned to S, S0, S01, S02, S1, S2, S3, SE, SSG, ST AND SV may be considered for this vacancy." What's going on back there?

Answer: (U) The statement currently included in SID vacancy announcement is just one step SID is taking to manage our end-of-year strength authorization. NSA must account for the number of people on its payroll via reports to Congressional oversight organizations at the end of each fiscal year. The Agency is expected to not exceed its overall strength allocation; one NSA Directorate might be slightly over-strength and another under-strength, but it must balance out Agency-wide.
(U) For the first time in several years, NSA is projected to reach its overall strength. The SIGINT Directorate is projected to be slightly over-strength. As a result, SID is temporarily restricting processes that could push our strength even higher and thereby restrict staffing in organizations that are under-strength.
(U) This restriction you see on vacancy announcements does not apply to reassimilees from the extended enterprise or to ICAP (Intelligence Community Assignment Program) graduates. SID recognizes our obligation (as well as the benefit) of assimilating these folks back into the headquarters work force. The text of our vacancy announcements has recently been reworded to make this more clear.
