(U) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present the 20th in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for 2006. " Iraq - By the Numbers ... Prospects for Stability, Insurgency, and U.S. Presence " will be presented by D/SINIO for Near East.

# Course Overview: 

(U//FOUO) To an almost numbed public, the war in Iraq exists as a daily experiment in futility. A rising body count on all sides, failing infrastructure and deep ethno-sectarian divisions threaten to fracture Iraq with regional implications. Taken in 30 -second sound bites, sensational factoids and photo ops, it would appear that progress is a long distant goal.
(U//FOUO) Iraq - By the Numbers is a blow-by-blow look at the major issues in Iraq. The good, the bad and the ugly are laid out and explored. We'll look at the SIGNT behind the stories, and the significance glossed over by the daily grind of mainstream media reporting. The discussion will include, but isn't limited to:

- The Insurgency
- The Ethnosectarian Divide
- Elections, Democratization and Government Formation
- Chances for Stability

Rather than claim to have all the answers, Iraq - By the Numbers will explore whether we're asking the right questions. What would a "democratic Iraq" realistically look like to Iraq? Are there sufficient levels of safety, security and working infrastructure for the "average Iraqi" to even care about democracy? What are the regional implications of the apparent progress in the primarily Kurdish north? These and other questions will be addressed as we attempt to make some order out of the puzzle that is Iraq.
