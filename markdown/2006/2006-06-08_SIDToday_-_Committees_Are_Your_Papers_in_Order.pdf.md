(U//FOUO) Committees: Are Your 'Papers' in Order?
FROM:
SIGINT Policy (S02L1)
Run Date: 06/08/2006
(U//FOUO) All Agency committees are required to have an approved charter...
(U) Oh no, not another meeting!?!?
(U//FOUO) Seriously, are you a member of an official committee or board that meets on a regular basis? Are the goals of the committee directly linked to the Agency's mission? Does the committee have an approved charter on file?
(U//FOUO) For NSA/CSS, a committee is defined as a group formed to be the most effective, expeditious and/or economical means of accomplishing an objective. This group, without the organizational structure the committee affords, would be unable to meet its objectives. Committees are required to have a formal written charter, approved by the sponsoring Directorate. NSA/CSS Policy 1-16, "NSA/CSS Committee Management," explains the charter process.
(U//FOUO) A list of all approved charters on file for SID can be found at the webpage below:

# Committee Charters 

(U//FOUO) If your committee is not currently on the list referenced above, or you are a member of a newly formed committee, or your group just has not taken the time to draft a charter, please review NSA/CSS Policy 1-16 and bring your group into compliance.
(U//FOUO) The SID focal point for committee charters is , SO2L1, , S02L1, . She is already working with several committees to update their charters, and looks forward to helping you with this important intiative.
