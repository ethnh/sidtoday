(S) SIGINT Leads to Capture of Colombian Narcotics and Weapons Trafficker

FROM:
Chief, FARC Branch, NSAT (FTS2F3)
Run Date: 11/02/2006
(S//SI//REL) NSA/CSS Texas (NSAT) provided strategic and real-time tactical intelligence leading to the capture of narcotics and weapons trafficker Jose María Corredor Ibague, also known as Boyaco, at a secluded encampment about 90 miles south of Bogotá on 15 October 2006. Boyaco headed an organization that trafficked cocaine on behalf of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and also purchased and coordinated inbound weapons shipments for the insurgency. His organization represents the link between the FARC and its foreign trafficking operations.
(S//SI//REL) The Embassy Intelligence Fusion Cell (EIFC) in Bogotá provided foreign releasable intelligence, published by NSAT's Transnational Crime and Narcotics (TCN) Division, directly to Colombian government leaders and military tactical elements, prompting a Colombian Joint Special Operations Command unit to launch an operation against Boyaco.
(S//SI//REL) During the operation, Denver's Aerospace Data Facility, National Security Operations Center, EIFC, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and NSAT TCN personnel came together to provide around-the-clock support in the form of geolocational information, analytic support, and finished intelligence which enabled Colombian forces to locate and capture Boyaco. The success of this effort is a testament to the critical nature of cooperation in today's cryptologic enterprise.
(S//SI//REL) NSA intelligence provided essential locations and intentions of the target during the operation itself, but more importantly, sustained collection and analysis furnished by TCN was pivotal in initially identifying the importance, need, and opportunity for planning and conducting an operation. Since Boyaco's July 2005 escape from a Venezuelan prison, where he was being held for narcotics trafficking, until his recapture this October, TCN has issued close to 300 SIGINT reports on his organization and activities. TCN continues to monitor intercept for reflections of the impact of Boyaco's arrest on FARC operations, as well as intentions to secure his freedom.

(S) Also captured at the encampment, which was capable of supporting 300 people, were 20 members of Boyaco's organization, including his wife and second-in-command, alias "La Negra." Boyaco, who has worked for the FARC for over 10 years, is currently undergoing questioning in Colombia pending extradition to the U.S.
