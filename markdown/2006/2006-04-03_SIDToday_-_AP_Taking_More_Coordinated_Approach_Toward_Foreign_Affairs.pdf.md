(U//FOUO) SID leaders travel to Germany to confer with SIGINT Liaison Officers.
(U//FOUO) On 14-16 March 2006, Carl Johnson and I attended the annual SIGINT Liaison Officer (SLO) Conference in Wiesbaden, Germany. If you're not aware, NSA has a SLO in many of our Third Party countries acting as the front-line representative in managing those partnerships for NSA. While the depth of these partnerships may vary, the challenges each of the SLOs faces are often similar, and this conference provides an opportunity for them to share problems and solutions and engage Agency seniors for relevant insight.
(U//FOUO) It is no secret that NSA has aggressively sought to expand these partnerships to help in the War on Terrorism and to address continued mission needs against other, more traditional, targets as well. It is the recognition of the critical mission role that SLOs play in leveraging such partnerships that led Carl to gladly accept an invitation to attend the conference this year.
(U//FOUO) SLOs, for the most part, are not connected to NSANet, so many conference attendees had questions about issues like Transformation, Turbulence, and the new budgetary "Lane" construct. As such, Gary Grantham, the Foreign Affairs Director and Jim Cusick, the Deputy Director of SID (acting), spent a great deal of time reviewing the current state of play on these and other strategic issues of import. The SLOs, however, had just as many questions about A\&P, with particular interest in the current status of Mission Alignment, the relative roles of GCs, GCMs and PPCMs* and, perhaps most importantly, changes that A\&P was pursuing in the Foreign Affairs (FA) arena.
(U//FOUO) With this in mind, Carl (SID/Deputy Director for A\&P) focused his discussion on the critical role of GCMs in managing their enterprise-wide mission, including the role they play in leveraging foreign partnerships. My presentation focused on moving partners, as appropriate, up the reference model (pushing them to provide analysis, not just bits of information) and providing insight into the new processes that A\&P is putting in place to guide the development of such relationships.
(U//FOUO) Given their role in partner engagement and given their relative lack of connectivity back to NSA, it was clear that SLOs want more insight into the overarching intent/strategy that A\&P and SID have with any given partner. To be blunt, they want to see coordinated A\&P positions with regard to each partnership and timely (and fully informed) A\&P answers to partner questions and inquiries. We believe the new A\&P FA processes we are instituting will help address these needs.
(U//FOUO) We discussed the new processes and the Foreign Affairs Management Board (FAMB) at length, advising that our goal is to facilitate cross-target strategy development and decision making, with the intent that A\&P mission priorities drive the strategy with each partner. In this regard we again stressed the role of the GCMs, with specific emphasis on the role that individual GCM representatives will play in the FA virtual team construct.
(U//FOUO) We left them with some of our own "care-abouts" as well, namely the need to manage partner expectations, provide a clear picture of partner capabilities and future opportunities, and arm us with a true picture of the partners long-term interests to facilitate our own decision making. In short, they fully welcomed the additional rigor that A\&P is adding to the FA process. They also clearly appreciated the investment that we made in traveling to Germany to represent A\&P and SID interests. For my part, I enjoyed the frequent sidebar discussions on partner issues, especially as these serve to inform how we press ahead in
developing processes to enable more effective partner engagement. Then again, I also enjoyed the bratwurst almost as much.
