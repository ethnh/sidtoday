(U//FOUO) SID Stands Up Team to Manage Deployments
FROM: the SID Deployment Team (S1)
Unknown
Run Date: 09/29/2006
(U//FOUO) Many questions face potential deployers. Whom should I talk to? What do I need to know?? Who are my contacts back at NSAW? What's the right kind of training for me? -- Too many questions for one person to answer, and sometime it's difficult to find that "one" right person.
(U//FOUO) Anyone who has worked a portion of the deployment process, or deployed in the past, knows there are a lot of moving parts, any of which can fail without constant monitoring and attention. Our mission requires that we send our folks forward to hostile areas. We cannot afford for this process to fail. To ensure success, SID Leadership has endorsed the stand-up of the SID Deployment Team. The purpose of this team is to synchronize these efforts at a corporate level throughout the SIGINT Enterprise.
(U) Specifically, the team will:

1. (U//FOUO) Standardize deployment training - Develop a two-tiered approach to ensure there is a base-line training plan (Tier 1) and position-specific training plan (Tier 2) for all deployers.
2. (U//FOUO) Manage expeditionary cryptology within SID - Develop SID-specific processes for administering the Cryptologic Expeditionary Force (CEF) program, selecting deployers and appealing deployment non-approvals.
3. (C) Address cover positions - Define a SID strategy that outlines appropriate cover for expeditionary SIGINT positions.
4. (U//FOUO) Review and revalidate positions - Biannually institute a process for all expeditionary positions.
5. (U//FOUO) Trouble-shoot - Monitor trends to identify and resolve consistent problems, raise key issues to SID leadership, build Agency networks to improve communication, and serve as the focal point for all deployment issues (utilizing the SID Deployment Forum as appropriate).
(U//FOUO) This team will act on behalf of SID Leadership for all deployment issues, in conjunction with all appropriate Agency organizations. The members of the SID Deployment Team are Chiet Chief and Chieti (C) (C). For questions related to deploying for SID, how SID is managing the Cryptologic Expeditionary Force (CEF) Program, or general queries, please feel free to contact the team at $\square$.
