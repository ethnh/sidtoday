(U//FOUO) Upcoming Close-Out of P3 Cycle and Initiation of GG15-and-Below Promotion Cycle

FROM:
SID Performance Management Executive (S0)
Run Date: 12/12/2006
(U//FOUO) I wanted to give you a heads-up that final P3 evaluations must be completed and submitted no later than 16:00 on 2 February 2007. Since the P3 deadline will be here before you know it, now is the time to start thinking about the next phase in the performance management process: the promotion cycle. Although the Agency promotion timeline has not been finalized, I know that the SID deadline to submit PRPs (Performance Review Packages) to supervisors will be in early March.
(U//FOUO) This note is to remind you to begin updating your Internal Staffing Resume (ISR) and assembling your PRP. Your PRP should contain:

- your resume,
- your last three final P3s and interims at your current grade, and
- your employee profile once it is available on/about 1 March 2007.

The HRS (Human Resources Service Centers) web page will be updated in the future to reflect the FY07 promotion cycle. Until then, you may still access the FY06 promotions, awards \& recognition web page for guidance and examples of how to complete your ISR and PRP.
(U//FOUO) Additional articles will be forthcoming detailing the promotion process and timeline, to include when and where to hand in your PRP, as well as how and when to pull your employee profile. Once the promotion cycle is in full swing, the SID Workforce Performance Management home page will contain the most up-to-date information about the upcoming promotion cycle. If you wish to access SID promotion information from the FY06 promotion cycle, go to the SID Workforce Performance Management home page's library .
(U//FOUO) Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have regarding the promotion process.
