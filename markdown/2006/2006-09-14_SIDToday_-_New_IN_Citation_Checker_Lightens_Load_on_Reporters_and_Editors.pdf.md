(U) New IN Citation Checker Lightens Load on Reporters and Editors

FROM:
of the Reporting Board (S12R)
Run Date: 09/14/2006
(U//FOUO) One of a SIGINT report editor's responsibilities is to check the REQS (requirements, or Information Needs/INs) line of each report, but the normal tools for doing this require submitting multiple queries for reports that contain multiple IN citations. This is a cumbersome process that can result in frequent generation of error messages, causing reporters extra work to correct them after publication.
(U//FOUO) Language analyst of Regional Targets (S2A) wrote a script that checks IN citations, and Information Sharing Services (S12) is grateful to him for allowing it to be accessed from the Reporting Page . ...And so will all reporters and editors once they start using the program, a JavaScript bookmarklet that can be installed in a Web browser like any other bookmark. Editors and reporters are encouraged to use this quick way to double-check whether IN citations are valid, are correctly formatted, and apply to the current report.
(U//FOUO) The bookmarklet will prompt for a REQS line; copy and paste the REQS line from your report into it, and hit return. While it's easiest to paste the REQS line into the field, you can also type in an IN number, but the checker is case-sensitive, which means extra care is needed in the typing. The bookmarklet will pop up a new Web page that displays, for all of your IN citations at once, the IN title, whether the IN is still current ("Active"), and the EEI cited. The information is being pulled from the NSRP web site, so you're seeing the actual text of the EEIs, without having to query each IN separately from the search page. Users can also launch the IN Citation Checker directly by bookmarking the tool in their browser.
(U//FOUO) This is a great example of individual initiative supported by larger organizations to the benefit of our hard-working analysts.
