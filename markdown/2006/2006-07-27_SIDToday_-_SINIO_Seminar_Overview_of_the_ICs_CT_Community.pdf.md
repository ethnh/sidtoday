## Course Overview:

(C) As we approach the fifth anniversary of 9/11, the Intelligence Community's efforts against terrorism continue to develop and mature. This is partly in response to the dynamic nature of the global terrorist threat -- which is judged to be spreading and adapting to international counterterrorism efforts -- but it also reflects the adoption of improved organizational structures, processes, and counterterrorism techniques. This seminar will provide a broad overview of the IC's still-evolving counterterrorism community, highlighting NSA's unique roles and responsibilities within that community, and will also address recent organizational and operational developments within NSA.
