(U) The Strategic Command Gathers No Moss

Deputy NCR USSTRATCOM (F1C)

# (U) What do these pictures have in common? 

(U) Congratulations if you knew that the two biggest events in Omaha last week were the ribbon cutting at the new USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC), and the concert appearance of the Rolling Stones. While at first glance there would seem to be little connection between the keeper of the United States' nuclear deterrence and the most enduring rock band in the world, STRATCOM (Strategic Command) and the Stones seem to be maintaining similar 40year timelines. The operations center that was transformed and formally re-opened on Tuesday was initially built in 1965, and the last time the Stones played in Omaha was in 1964, when they drew a crowd of 561 to the Omaha Civic Center.
(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS Representative (NCR) STRATCOM and I attended the GOC event, and saw USSTRATCOM Commander General Cartwright, USMC, LtGen Chilton, USAF, Commander of the STRATCOM Joint Functional Component for Space \& Global Strike, and a Lockheed Martin vice-president cut the ribbon. Gen Cartwright told the assembled battle staff and media people that the reopening was "a major milestone, moving forward how we are able to do business." And what a business it is! In addition to the traditional mission of strategic nuclear deterrence, STRATCOM is now responsible for:

- computer network warfare,
- global intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR),
- space and global strike capabilities,
- combating weapons of mass destruction and
- integrated missile defense.
(S) The F1C (NCR STRATCOM) team interacts daily with STRATCOM leadership and action officers on a broad range of issues across STRATCOM. While the sounds of "Jumpin' Jack Flash" were still echoing in the Qwest Center, NSAers were working actions that include countering adversarial use of the Internet, assessing the foreign threats to a modernized Nuclear Command and Control system, locating mobile missiles, launching a decision-based Needs Assessment to identify the Command's SIGINT requirements for space operations situational awareness and defining the interrelationships in the capabilities for theater SIGINT collection platforms like RIVET JOINT, to better support both STRATCOM and the geographic combatant commands that STRATCOM supports.
(U//FOUO) Because General Cartwright wants to "fight the networks" as if it were a weapon system, STRATCOM is striving to bring the offensive and defensive aspects of network operations and warfare closer together. So, while a lot of our daily focus is on getting SIGINT support applied to the Command's mission sets, we in F1C are also blending cryptologic missions in a manner similar to what they're doing in the NTOC (NSA/CSS Threat Operations Center), because STRATCOM's missions require it.
(S) While transformation is clearly a watchword at USSTRATCOM, "legacy missions" remain critical as well, and even they show evidence of mission blending. On 7 October, I was in the STRATCOM Commander's Situation Room (CSR) with IAD Director Mr. Wolf and General Cartwright, discussing plans for an upcoming Information Assurance Focus Day. Discussions
were interrupted when the GOC Battlewatch Commander called General Cartwright to inform him that a Russian SS-N-18 had just been launched. Although the launch window had been announced days earlier in accordance with START Treaty protocols, an in-flight ICBM still draws intense interest at USSTRATCOM.
(S) Missile tracking data from a variety of sensors including SIGINT, Infrared Intelligence (IRINT) and Radar Intelligence (RADINT) was routed to the CSR and displayed on the large wall screens and assessed. In rapid succession, General Cartwright contacted the USNORTHCOM Commander and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to ensure common awareness. All of this was done very rapidly, because a nominal 26 minute flight from launch to impact in a test range in Kamchatka, contradicts Mr. Jagger's assertion that "time is on my side." It was fascinating to be a front row observer on a real-world scenario that shows how integrating a global perspective on strategic weapons from STRATCOM with a focus on defending the homeland at NORTHCOM is a complex and nuanced undertaking.
(U//FOUO) Opportunities exist to join in and make a difference in this very exciting mission area. So here's an invitation to each individual in the enterprise who has said, "Start me up!" to themselves recently. If you "Can't Get No Satisfaction" in your current assignment and feel like a "Beast of Burden," you'd be a "Fool to Cry." "Get Off My Cloud" and apply for a tour as the STRATCOM Account Manager in S1 which is currently advertised. Selection will put you in the center of where NSA and DoD are headed and make you "Happy," because although you can't always get what you want, if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.
(U//FOUO) Submitter @SSP@S1@SSP, Deputy NCR STRATCOM, had a front row seat at the Stones concert and his only disappointment was that the set list didn't include "19th Nervous Breakdown."
