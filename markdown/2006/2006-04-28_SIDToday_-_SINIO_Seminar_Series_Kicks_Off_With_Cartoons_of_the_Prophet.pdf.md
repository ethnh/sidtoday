(C) On Wednesday, 3 May the SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present the first in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for Summer 2006. " Cartoons of the Prophet: Clash of Cultures or Momentary Misunderstanding? " will be presented by the SINIO for Europe, and the D/SINIO for Near East South Asia.

Course Overview:
(C) Four months after the publication of 12 cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper, protestors set fire to the Danish Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon and a dozen people died in violent protests in Afghanistan. This seminar will describe the sequence of events and the issues growing out of the publication of the cartoons--from both the European and Islamic perspectives. The conflicting claims that pit "freedom of expression" against "respect for religion," as well as the call for "standards" for the media, will be examined. The long-term impact on Europe, the United States and Islamic countries--and the potential "clash of civilizations" -- will be assessed. The implications for U.S. policy and the role of the Intelligence Community and SIGINT will also be discussed.
