# (U) CPE Online Training Now Available 

FROM:
Chief, ISS's Marketing and Communications Branch (S12M2)
Run Date: 10/11/2006
(U//FOUO) In addition to instructor-led training sessions, CPE (Content Preparation Environment) instruction is now available via online computer-based training (CBT).
(U//FOUO) The CBT includes a tutorial that uses step-by-step instructions to show the student how to create a report and send it to a reviewer, as well as how to do revisions and recalls. It can be accessed by going to the CPE website ("go cpe") and then selecting Computer-Based Training under the subheading Help and Training listed in the Featured Services box on the left side of the page.
(U//FOUO) If you are on a UNIX terminal and use Netscape, you will have to download Flashplayer to your machine in order to access the CPE CBT. If you do not wish to do so, the CBT is also accessible in Internet Explorer.

## (U) Feedback Welcome

(U//FOUO) The CBT contains a mechanism that allows users to provide feedback, whether positive or negative, on its content and organization. Your candid feedback will help us in our efforts to make the CBT as useful and practical to you as possible.

## (U) Upcoming

(U) Further details on CPE will be forthcoming on a regular basis via CPE communiqu√©s. For more information, please visit the CPE website.
