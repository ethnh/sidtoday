(U//FOUO) Looking at Intelligence in a Different Way
FROM: David T. Moore
Senior Intelligence Authority, Technical Director (S2)

(U//FOUO) Are you looking for a good, non-traditional read on intelligence? I may have a resource for you! As the Technical Director for the Senior Intelligence Authority, I serve as a thought leader for the Office of the NSA/CSS Senior Intelligence Authority. So, exactly what does that mean?
(U//FOUO) I am part of an informal group of professionals spread across NSA/CSS and the Intelligence Community that seeks to inform and challenge contemporary thinking about intelligence. My focus is the theory and practice of intelligence sensemaking. Over the past several years, first in the Advanced Analysis Lab and then in my current position, I have been developing and implementing a method of critical thinking and analytic problem solving in support of NSA, SID, and Analysis\& Production (A\&P, S2) efforts to improve intelligence creation.
(U//FOUO) Such innovation does not occur in a vacuum. Developing new ideas requires communication and collaboration with NSA/CSS, Intelligence Community (IC), other U.S. Government, non-government, and Allied partners involved in related efforts. Such work leverages collective and individual strengths, and gathers information to the furtherance of A\&P, SID, and NSA/CSS missions. For example, recent work as part of the National Defense Intelligence College's Denial and Deception Advanced Studies Program led to the development of new paradigms for structuring intelligence sensemaking that consciously consider the possibility and likelihood of adversarial deception. The implications of this work are broad and I am pursuing them further at both the classified and unclassified levels.
(U//FOUO) My work with external experts and my deliberations about the practice of intelligence creation result in my collecting and generating resources for cryptologic intelligence professionals. I publicize A\&P outreach efforts such as the collaboration between SIGDEV and a regional college's institute for intelligence studies, or the AAL and the Global Business Network efforts to the larger intelligence community. One consequence of this partnering is the recognition of Mercyhurst's* value to the IC as an open-source resource. Novel partnering with the National Intelligence Council is being explored.
(U//FOUO) Finally, I seek to bring useful resources from the outside into the Agency. As a part of this work, I maintain a web site containing documents, conference and trip reports, and news of events of interest. A report on a trip to Apple Computer and IDEO is a recent addition. Other new materials are added on a routine basis. At present, these are textual. In the future I plan to add video and audio files. To get there, type "go iatd" in your browser, or click HERE.
