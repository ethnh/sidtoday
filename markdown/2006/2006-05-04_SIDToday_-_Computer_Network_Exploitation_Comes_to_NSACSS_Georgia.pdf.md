(S//SI) With a snip of the fiber optic cable serving as the ribbon, NSA/CSS Georgia leaps into the 21st Century! NSAG recently marked a significant milestone in its continued growth and development as a cryptologic center when leaders from NSAW and NSAG participated in the Georgia Remote Operations Center (GROC) ribbon-cutting ceremony. NSAG Deputy Commander was joined by Teresa Shea, Chief of NSAW's Tailored Access Operations Group, and NSAG SID Chief CAPT Lee Cardwell.

(S//SI) The occasion represented the culmination of months of hard work by many key people in Maryland and in Georgia who dedicated their efforts to bringing this first step in Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) operations to NSAG as part of Tailored Access' Remote Operations Center mission.

(S//SI) opened the ceremony by expressing his great pleasure with celebrating the initiation of this new mission in Georgia. He also thanked Ms. Shea and her staff for all their hard work in bringing the GROC into existence, commending the Tailored Access Operations Group for looking ahead toward growing CNE at extended enterprise locations even before General Hayden envisioned the mission alignment concept.
(S//SI) The pattern for the growth of the tailored access mission in Georgia follows that of the other Cryptologic Centers -- crawl, walk, run. NSAG is the last of the CCs to come on line; because of that, its operation will be the most current, and it will benefit from the lessons learned by Hawaii and Texas.
(TS//SI) "It's really a pleasure for us to be here today," said Ms. Shea. "We're excited to see you coming on board, taking on responsibility for CNE, with plans to grow into CND* and CNA*. This is a growth mission, and we've established a very good partnership. We at NSAW consider you to be on the front lines, and we're proud to support you in your support to troops forward."
(S//SI) The GROC's current staff of three will be bolstered this summer by three additional operators. Next year an analytic piece will be added, and by 2008 the GROC expects to begin interactive operations that require the highest level of technical skills and training. By 2011 the effort will boast 80 - 100 analysts, operators, and infrastructure experts.
(S) While those involved in the establishment of the GROC look back with appreciation for what's already been accomplished, they also look forward to even greater things to come. The future of CNE looks peachy in Georgia!
