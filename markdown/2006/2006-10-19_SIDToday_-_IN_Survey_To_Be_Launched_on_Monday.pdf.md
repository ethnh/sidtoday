(U//FOUO) IN Survey To Be Launched on Monday
FROM: RDML Thomas P. Meek, USN
SID's Deputy Director for Customer Relationships (S1)
Run Date: 10/19/2006
(U//FOUO) Survey will determine whether Information Needs are working well. All who receive the survey are asked to respond.
(U//FOUO) Last year the Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD) conducted an Information Needs (IN) survey of SIGINT producers and enablers. We asked about the IN process, the structure and usability of INs, the National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) tool, and training and education.
(U//FOUO) You answered, and your responses were loud and clear: INs do not drive the system, NSRP is not user-friendly, there are too many INs, the process is time-consuming, and training is inadequate.
(U//FOUO) We listened and took steps to implement changes: we offered additional training courses designed to increase your understanding of INs, we made changes to the Research IN response process, we modified EEI-level Level of Effort statements, we improved user preferences in NSRP, and we used IN profiles and SIGINT tasks to dedupe and reduce the number of INs on the books.
(U//FOUO) Now we want to know if our efforts have paid off -- are we doing better? And where do we go from here? On 23 October 2006, we will launch the 2nd annual IN Survey to measure our progress and drive future improvements.
(U) The web-based survey should take less than 10 minutes, and all who receive it are urged to complete it. We value your feedback and ask for your cooperation in this endeavor. Please help us help you.
