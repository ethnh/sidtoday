(U//FOUO) MG Quirk's Wiki Walk-Through
FROM:
SID Technical Team
Run Date: $01 / 17 / 2006$
(U//FOUO) SID workforce encouraged to share information using the Wiki -- an on-line encyclopedia of knowledge compiled by... everyone.
(U//FOUO) Wiki Wiki, What is a Wiki? Wikis have been prevalent on the Internet for a number of years. Wiki is a Hawaiian word that means fast, fast. Wiki has also been turned into at least one acronym. One straightforward acronym is "What I Know Is... ." Another more literal translation from Hawaiian is " What is -- Know It ." In both cases, a Wiki is a new web collaboration tool that offers great potential for NSA and the community. They represent a new model of sharing -anyone can edit any part of a website at any time!
(U//FOUO) The core principle of Wikis are that the group is more knowledgeable than any individual member of the group and that by allowing all to edit, the accuracy and completeness of the information will grow exponentially, creating an enormous, increasingly accurate encyclopedia of knowledge over time. This concept is especially well suited to a closed network like NSA's where every user must be identified and authenticated.
(U//FOUO) On 28 December 2005, MG Quirk was given a "Wiki Walkthrough" of the Wiki editing tool. He was amazed at the Wiki tool ease of use and immediately made several contributions to the site! The Wiki environment captures and archives the discussions, documents, and ideas made by all Wiki users. MG Quirk highly encourages his leadership and the workforce to collaborate in this new adaptive, flexible web environment. Wikis are a new communications media designed to easily share and collaborate via the web.
(U//FOUO) Wiki spaces are available for exploration and improvement at the R6 Wiki site. Type " Go Wiki " in your browser to visit the home page and begin adding content. There is a Wiki page already established to capture ideas on new uses of Wikis, blogs, and other forms of collaboration on NSANet. (See the Wiki Emerging Collaborative Applications at NSA.)
(U//FOUO) It's is clear to MG Quirk that Wikis offer a valuable addition to the advancement of our net-centric enterprise and everyone is encouraged to apply them to their mission areas as appropriate!
