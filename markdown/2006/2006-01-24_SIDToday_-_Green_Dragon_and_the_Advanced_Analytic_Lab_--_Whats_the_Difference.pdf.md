(U//FOUO) Green Dragon and the Advanced Analytic Lab -- What's the Difference?

(U//FOUO) Recently some have heard about the GREEN DRAGON program and wondered, "What's the difference between GREEN DRAGON and the Advanced Analytic Lab (AAL) organization?" Although both are managed by A\&P, they are not one and the same! With the help of A\&P's leading authority on the subject, Curt Boylis, I'll do my best to clarify what each is (and is not):
(S//SI) First, GREEN DRAGON (GD) is not an organization, but rather a DIRNSA-driven program managed by A\&P. Its aim is to create "germination centers" that bring mature or postprototype analytic tools and technologies - not used at NSA up till now - and test them in realworld operations. GD is rapidly acquiring COTS/GOTS* tools and integrating them into test workstations to see whether these technologies can complement the tools we already use, to improve our effectiveness against real target problems. GREEN DRAGON sponsors neither technology nor tradecraft research, and operates on 90-day cycles.
(S//SI) The Advanced Analytic Lab (AAL), on the other hand, is an organization under A\&P (S22) that exists to develop advanced SIGINT methodologies and techniques and drive them into operations. It does this by:

1. Creating and fostering advanced tradecraft;
2. Guiding and advancing research in ways useful to SIGINT analysis; and
3. Providing A\&P liaison with the SID/RAD (Research Directorate) Bridge.

The AAL is all about research, whether waging analytic attacks against hard SIGINT problems, or by identifying the technical capabilities that SID needs and arranging for research to be carried out to find workable solutions.
(S//SI) As a program, GREEN DRAGON is dependent upon help from many existing organizations across NSA, including AAL. Presently, the AAL provides assistance to GD in terms of analytic technologies and new analytic tradecraft, but by no means is AAL a sole-supplier for GREEN DRAGON, nor does GD concern itself with AAL's research agenda. Both activities are overseen by A\&P, however.
(U//FOUO) These are exciting times for the SIGINT analysis profession. Unique opportunities exist for our analysts to participate personally in developing tools and other transformation activities that will retain NSA's status as the superlative intelligence producer for years to come.
