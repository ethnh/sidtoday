(TS//SI//REL) Expanding TAO's Operational Capabilities Out to the CCs

FROM:
TAO/Remote Operations Center (S321)
Run Date: 10/20/2006
(TS//SI//REL) Computer Network Exploitation now being carried out in Hawaii, Texas and Georgia
(TS//SI//REL) On 14 June, NSA Hawaii conducted its first interactive Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) operation -- in this instance against a Chinese target. The operation was a complete success. This is just the latest in a series of steps taken to develop greater TAO (Tailored Access Operations) capabilities at the Cryptologic Centers.
(TS//SI//REL) NSA Texas began conducting interactive collection operations in mid-October 2005. Next, an upgraded version of TAO's automated vulnerability-testing tool became operational in December 2005 and was put to use at both NSA Texas and NSA Georgia. By midMay 2006, NSA Texas had conducted over 3300 vulnerability scans, and NSA Georgia had successfully executed more than 1300.
(TS//SI//REL) Looking ahead, TAO analytic elements have teamed with the Cryptologic Centers to initiate a training program to certify endpoint network analysts at the CCs. A strong partnership between endpoint operators and analysts (i.e. those who get the data and those who examine the result) is crucial for the successful prosecution of Computer Network Operations targets.
(U//FOUO) Stay tuned as we continue to develop these capabilities in the Extended Enterprise!
