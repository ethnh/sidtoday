(U) Founded in 1994, the Women in Mathematics Society (WiMS) strives to enhance both the recruitment and retention of mathematicians at NSA. WiMS also supports national efforts to address the under-representation of women in mathematics and through WiMS mentoring programs.
(U//FOUO) A Brief History of WiMS: WiMS came into existence after a seminal conference in 1993 that was held to address the dearth of employment applications from competitive female mathematicians. At that time, the statistics on the number of female mathematicians employed at the NSA -- the nation's largest employer of mathematicians in the country -- were not encouraging. Records from 1987 to 1993 reveal that only $26 \%$ of the women hired during that period had higher than a Bachelor's degree, compared with $61 \%$ of men. Furthermore, of the roughly 30 Ph.D. mathematicians hired during that time, only two were female.
(U//FOUO) During the two-day conference, some of the most influential female mathematicians from colleges and universities from across the country gathered at NSA for a series of research talks, panel discussions, and informal networking sessions with NSA mathematicians. From this symposium emerged a set of themes that suggested concrete, near-term solutions to NSA's difficulty in attracting and retaining competitive women applicants. These themes provided the impetus for the establishment, immediately following the conference, of today's Women in Mathematics Society.
(U//FOUO) Since the conference and the formation of WiMS, the hiring statistics have improved significantly. Of the female mathematicians who have been hired since 1994, over 50\% of them hold either a Master's or Doctoral degree (with approximately $38 \%$ of them holding the Doctorate in mathematics). And the number of female Ph.D.s working in mathematics at the Agency has skyrocketed to over 40.
(U) Reaching out to a Younger Generation: WiMS strives to encourage more girls and young women to pursue advanced study and careers in the mathematical sciences. WiMS plays an active role in recruiting female employees and students to the NSA by sending members to speak at career fairs, at mathematics departments and institutes throughout the country, and at other venues that are attended by young women. For instance, for the past several years WiMS has sent a volunteer to the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics to speak about career opportunities in mathematics at the NSA.

conference is one of the premier events in the country for attracting the most talented undergraduate women majoring in mathematics. Throughout the year, WiMS will typically send 10-12 volunteers out on speaking engagements of this sort.
(U) WiMS also hosts an annual networking reception at the Joint Meetings of the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematics Association of America (two of the largest associations for mathematicians in the country). This reception gives graduate students and professors the chance to mingle with NSA mathematicians and to learn more about the working environment at the Agency.
(U) In yet another venture, WiMS has partnered with the NSA Office of Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Serving Institutions (HBCU/MI Office) to provide mentors to NSA summer graduate student interns. In this program, WiMS members are paired up with summer mathematics graduate students and meet with the students on a regular basis to discuss the ins and outs of graduate school, career concerns, and assimilating to NSA worklife.
(U//FOUO) WiMS Recognized with Federal Award: In February of this year, WiMS won the Baltimore Federal Executive Board (BFEB) Women's Council Award in the organizational category. This award is bestowed upon an organization that:

- exercises initiative and willingness in promoting activities and programs that have a positive impact on the development of women,
- assumes responsibility for improving an atmosphere of employment which is harmonious and supportive of the needs and achievements of women employment, and
- assists women employees in identifying and attaining career goals.
