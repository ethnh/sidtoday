(S) Polish Partner Making Enormous Strides with Reporting Effort

(S//SI) The SIGINT arm of our partner, the Polish Intelligence Agency (AW), has made tremendous strides with its reporting effort in the last five months. AW personnel received the first portion of FAD's* reporter training in mid-June, just as their TLO (Technical Liaison Officer) for analysis was PCSing home. AW analysts immediately grabbed the opportunity to stand on their own and have since released 34 reports.
(S//SI) A "technical exchange" circuit was set up over Baybridge so that SLO (SIGINT Liaison Officer) Warsaw and the course instructor could provide initial reviews or feedbacks to AW on the reports before they were released to a wide audience, but very little feedback has been necessary in the past few weeks. In fact, DIA analysts sent in feedback in late October on one report, citing the significance of the information as "high" and noted that they were looking forward to see future reporting of this sort.
(S//SI) This week, AW sent in two six-paragraph reports that would have made any NSA editor happy. The reports were properly formatted and included a great level of detail and attribution. With the exception of some minor English-language issues, the report was good to go. And the best part was that neither SLO nor the instructor had proof read the report for AW! The highly motivated AW analysts, who have released 34 reports since June (compared to 1 report all year before that), were scheduled to receive the second half of the reporter training in early December.
