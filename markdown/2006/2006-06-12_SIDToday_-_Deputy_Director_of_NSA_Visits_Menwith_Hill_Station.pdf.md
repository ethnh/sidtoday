(U//) Deputy Director of NSA Visits Menwith Hill Station

(U//FOUO) It was an exciting time for Menwith Hill Station (MHS) when Deputy Director Bill Black stopped by for a one-day visit on 25 May. The timing was perfect, as the announcement that Mr. Black would become the new SUSLO (Special US Liaison Officer) London was just released.
(U//FOUO) During his visit, Mr. Black had a chance to meet with a broad range of MHS personnel and see much of the station. After meeting with the commander and taking a "windshield tour" of the facility, Mr. Black spent much of the afternoon in Operations. He learned about MHS' contributions to TURBULENCE, horizontal integration, real-time tipping and our troops down range.
(U//FOUO) Later in the day, Mr. Black held a town hall meeting with the Menwith Hill workforce. In a laid-back, witty style, he spent the first part of this session commenting on some of the press that NSA was getting back home. He reassured the workforce that NSA receives a great deal of support from Congress and the President.
(S//SI) Mr. Black emphasized the importance of cross-mission collaboration and getting the whole of NSA on one interconnected infrastructure. Many of the components needed to make this infrastructure a reality are being tested at Menwith Hill Station. His comment that MHS is a key site for our exploitation of cyberspace was well received.
(U//FOUO) The close collaboration of the decision-makers in Washington and NSA was highlighted by the fact that the DIRNSA meets with the Secretary of Defense every Friday and with the President a couple of times per month. Political and military leaders are relying more and more on the intelligence and analysis that NSA provides. To continue and improve that intelligence, Mr. Black commented that, "We need to make the world SIGINT-friendly," and "We need to be as efficient and as effective as the internet."
(U//FOUO) After his comments, Mr. Black opened the floor to questions. He got quite a few, including issues related to personnel, national-tactical integration, the cryptologic centers, second-party relationships and the NSA budget.
(U//FOUO) When asked about his plans for his new role as SUSLO London, Mr. Black joked that his first priority is just to get here. He noted the importance of the relationship between the US and UK and looks forward to further strengthening this SIGINT partnership. With Mr. Black moving to the UK in the next couple of months, this visit will hopefully be the first of many to MHS as he takes up his new position.
