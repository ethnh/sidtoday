(U//FOUO) Alaska MOC Given SIGINT Authority

FROM:
Chief of Staff, SID/Analysis \& Production (S2)
Run Date: 07/11/2006
(U//FOUO) Trum Soule, A\&P's Chief of Staff, traveled to Anchorage recently to participate in a change-of-command ceremony at the AMOC and to formally grant SIGINT authority to the site. He also paid a visit to Yakima Research Station.
(U//FOUO) Last week I was honored to represent NSA at the change-of-command ceremony at the Alaska Mission Operations Center (AMOC) at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. Outgoing commander Lt. Col. Paul Wade, USAF relinquished command to me, and I passed the AMOC guidon to incoming commander Lt. Col. John Riehl, USAF as he assumed command. This seemingly extra step of passing the command through me is actually very significant. It was with this action that the AMOC was given SIGINT authority. It was truly a unique event.
(U//FOUO) Earlier in the ceremony, I observed as Col. Jacqueline Walsh, Commander of the 692nd Intelligence Group, officiated Lt. Col. Riehl's assumptiom of command of the 381st Intelligence Squadron; Lt.Col. Riehl is now serving as commander of both the 381st and the AMOC. After the ceremony, I had an opportunity to meet the NSA civilians at AMOC, and to receive comprehensive briefings and tours of the facility accompanied throughout by
(SS) an NSA civilian, who is Deputy of the AMOC.
(S//SI) The AMOC has a great mission, which expanded on the day before I arrived. Wendy Allen, Global Capabilities Manager for Russia, observed as our British colleagues transferred Russian air mission from Digby Global SIGINT Operations Center (DgSOC). Under Ms. Allen's guidance, the AMOC has restructured its operations to facilitate the transfer of Russian air targets from DgSOC and NSA/CSS Texas (see background) and ensure that it is postured for mission effectiveness and efficiency.
(S//SI) As the AMOC assumes full responsibility in its role as the Center of Excellence for Russian Air Targets, customers can expect to see a continued emphasis on timely and accurate reporting of Indications \& Warning (I\&W)/Threat Warning-related activity but they will also see a more focused approach to non-I\&W-related air activity which will emphasize value-added analysis and reporting. In a testament to our close 60-year UKUSA partnership, Her Majesty's Government now relies solely on NSA/CSS for its coverage of this vital mission.
(U//FOUO) En route to Alaska I took advantage of the opportunity to stop in Washington State and spend a day at Yakima Research Station. As is always the case, when I visit a field activity, the time was well spent. I never fail to learn something during my time with NSAers around the world. I was afforded tours of Yakima's operations floor and was given briefings on significant, local activities. My hosts were gracious and based on their enthusiastic descriptions of what Yakima has to offer, they might as well be members of the Chamber of Commerce!*
(U//FOUO) I arrived home about 72 hours after I left. I was tired, sure, but I was also grateful to again have had the experience of meeting with fellow SIGINTers and participating in passing the flame to a new commander at the AMOC.
