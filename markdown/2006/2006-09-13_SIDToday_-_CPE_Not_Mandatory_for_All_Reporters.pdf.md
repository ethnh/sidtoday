(U) CPE Not Mandatory for All Reporters

FROM:
Chief, ISS's Marketing and Communications Branch (S12M2)
Run Date: 09/13/2006
(U) As noted in last week's article, a new Content Preparation Environment report-authoring tool will be rolled out later this year. Here's some additional information...
(U) As the replacement for SOD, CPE will be used initially by current SOD users. After the initial rollout, it will also be available to other offices that might benefit from it. All reporters and analysts, however, are not obligated to use it.
(U) Rule of thumb: if you are a current SOD user, you will transition to CPE during the initial rollout. If you are not a current SOD user, the initial rollout of CPE will not affect you. (This does not pertain to Sensi-check, SRO/RO, or URS Center personnel, who will need to become familiar with CPE because of their special status).

## (U) Target Offices

(U) The offices listed in the link below are scheduled to participate in the SOD-CPE transition. If your office is not on this list, you do not have to worry about transitioning to CPE during the initial rollout. Also, please be aware that not all reporters in these offices will be using CPE. Remember the rule of thumb: if you are a current SOD user, you will transition to CPE during the initial rollout. If you are not a current SOD user, the initial rollout of CPE will not affect you.

## Rollout Schedule

## (U) Upcoming

(U) Further details on CPE will be forthcoming on a regular basis via CPE communiqu√©s between now and the rollout date. For more information on CPE, please visit the CPE website ("go cpe").
