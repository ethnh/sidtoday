(U) The New A\&P Strategy

FROM:
SIGINT Performance Planning (S01X)

(U//FOUO) The Goals and Objectives contained in the USSS Strategy (Placemat) can only be achieved through well coordinated efforts across the organization. Carl Johnson's introduction of the new A\&P Strategy is an example of how this takes place. The three Goals of the A\&P strategy, listed below, reflect the primary components of Goals B. 2 and C. 1 in the USSS Strategy. The activities managed through the A\&P strategy are designed to implement those USSS Goals at the "local" level and make the A\&P workforce an integral part of the effort.
(U//FOUO) Goal 1, " Deliver high impact analysis against the missions that matter most to our customers, " focuses on the customer, the analytic work force, and the management responsible for ensuring their preparedness and measuring their progress.
(U//FOUO) Goal 2, " Advance analysis through skills, tradecraft, and technology development ," describes the means by which A\&P will achieve its vision - by accelerating and expanding analysts' ability to recognize the relevance and intelligence value of information.
(U//FOUO) Goal 3, " Achieve a collaborative analytic community ," tackles one of the most important issues challenging the Intelligence Community. This goal builds upon the DNI's vision that analysis will increasingly be achieved through integration with partners, foreign intelligence relationships, and non-traditional partners who can provide added value to our analysis.
