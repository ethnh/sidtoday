# (U) Encouraging Innovation 

FROM: Dave Hurry
SIGINT Technical Director
Run Date: 04/27/2006
(S//SI) A new wiki and blog have been created to encourage a "network of innovators" among SIGINTers around the world.
(S//SI//REL) MG Quirk, the SIGINT Director, and the SID Senior Leadership are very interested in encouraging innovation across the SIGINT Enterprise. First, we may offer a definition for innovation as " a creative work environment that is oriented toward risk-taking ." We're talking about innovation geared towards producing actual results, not innovation regarding changes in organizational structures.
(S//SI//REL) We would like to encourage an entire network of innovators, with participation from SIGINTers around the globe. With communications tools now at our disposal, SIGINTers worldwide can easily exchange information, share knowledge, and reshape internal workflow processes. Wikis (an on-line encyclopedia of knowledge compiled by everyone) and blogs (a forum for exchanging opinions and ideas) are examples of the collaborative tools we can use to good effect in this endeavor.
(U) New Wiki
(S//SI//REL) We would like to introduce you to a new wiki called " SIDcom " (SID Collaborative Communications) to help SIGINTers more effectively communicate and share information across the enterprise via the web. A Topic Area entitled Instilling Innovation was created in the SIDCOM wiki. MG Quirk and the SID Senior Leadership encourages contributions to this wiki environment. This wiki web space is designed to share "unfinished" and evolving work in an open web environment, in addition to fostering cross-links to more structured web sites and portals.
(U) New blog
(U//FOUO) We additionally encourage you to use the new NSANet Blogging Service, JournalNSA, another forward step in net-centric collaboration. We created a new Community of Interest (COI) in JournalNSA named Innovative ideas, Solutions and Successes and would encourage dialog in this space about innovative concepts, practices, and/or solutions to SIGINT issues.
(U) The tools are in place to help colleagues around the globe innovate and produce better SIGINT -- let's use them!
