(U//FOUO) Improving Dataflow to a Valued Partner
FROM:
Chief, CHIPPEWA (S3C12)
Run Date: $11 / 14 / 2006$
(S//REL) CHIPPEWA, part of the Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) and charged with the mission of passing sensitive intelligence to a Third Party customer, recently implemented a technical improvement, CommonView Beacons, to speed this process. CHIPPEWA CommonView Beacons provide web-based tools for the 24/7 monitoring and daily maintenance of this vital dataflow system.
(S//REL) Now CHIPPEWA operators are able to see when all traffic is received for processing and if any systems are not functioning properly. Before these beacons were installed, CHIPPEWA operators were unable to identify system problems unless the Partner alerted them or if an operator noticed something unusual.
(S//REL) The CommonView Beacons:

- reflect the overall status of production systems;
- provide notification when files arrive for processing;
- indicate the percent usage of each system; and
- alert operators when problems occur.

All of this comes together to ensure that all of the CHIPPEWA systems stay up and running, and that the Partner gets critical information in a timely manner.
