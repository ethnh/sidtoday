# (C) New USSID: Data Acquisition Enterprise Governance 

FROM:
Director, Enterprise Management, Data Acquisition (S3)
Run Date: 05/09/2006
(C) Governance, governance, governance...If you've...

- been involved with this year's Site Commanders Operational Review or any of the forums that MG Quirk runs on Mission Discernment or Assessment,
- work with I\&L or ITD on issues regarding the NSA/CCS field sites, or
- participated in DIRNSA's recent Enterprise Leadership Conference,
...you know that governance is a hot topic across the NSA. How do we define it and how does it affect people and functional responsibilities in the netcentric organization we are striving to build?
(C) Late last year, following almost a year's worth of activity and coordination with S3 sites worldwide, the SID Deputy Directorate for Data Acquisition (DA) published USSID SE5300 "U.S. SIGINT System Data Acquisition Enterprise Governance" - a first attempt at identifying a governance model and processes for the worldwide Data Acquisition Enterprise. Following on from SID Management Directive 411, in which DA is charged with overall operational control of all NSA/CSS collection sites, mission ground stations, and technical and research centers*, the Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (DDDA) has now outlined where responsibilities lie for:
- mission guidance, tasking and execution;
- resource allocation;
- policy;
- mission standards, and
- performance metrics
...using a "centralized direction and decentralized execution" model, with specific roles and responsibilities identified for NSA HQ elements and field site commanders.
(U//FOUO) Regardless of your position within Data Acquisition, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with this policy. Governance matters because we are all part of a single global organization. Defined roles and processes as well as a unified architecture and standards will promote agility and interoperability as we capitalize on partnerships throughout the Enterprise. The tenets of Governance are clear and consistent strategic intent and planning to enable netcentric operations, foster flexibility and accountability, and appropriately resource our missions.
(U//FOUO) We can reach this goal by consistent and open communication and a common understanding of what Governance is and why each and every one of us plays a part. You can access the Data Acquisition Governance policy by typing "go ussid" or simply by clicking here:
