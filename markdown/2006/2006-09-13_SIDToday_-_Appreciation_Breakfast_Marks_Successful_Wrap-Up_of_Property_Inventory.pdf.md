(U) Now vs. Then
(U//FOUO) As pointed out by keynote speaker Joe Brand, SID's Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Support (S02), SID has come a long way in its efforts to account for all of the property used by the Directorate. A few years ago, SID leaders recognized that the Directorate needed to do a better job of this, and took steps to improve the situation.
(U//FOUO) So how much better are we doing now? At the conclusion of the 2006 Inventory, $99.44 \%$ of the equipment (i.e. all but 232 pieces) was accounted for, and 10 more items were located in the days following. This represents a dramatic improvement over the levels of just four years ago, when 1,228 pieces were reported missing.
(U) What is "Property," and Who Counts It?
(U//FOUO) In this context, "property" refers not to desks or chairs, but specifically to pieces of electronic equipment with a price tag over $\$ 5,000$, and to all computers/servers, laptops and PDAs regardless of cost. The quantity is tremendous: SID property numbers 41,000 pieces of equipment valued at over $\$ 710$ million. This is the largest account at NSA, about $30 \%$ of the Agency total.
(U//FOUO) The difficult job of accounting for all of this property falls to the SID Property Office (S02S1), together with 167 property officers (as a collateral duty) and 145 managers scattered throughout SID. These personnel ensure that all property in their branch, division or office is identified.
(U//FOUO) As Mr. Brand noted, SID owes it to US taxpayers to keep close watch on the equipment entrusted to us. Through the hard work of all those who participated in the inventory, we're now doing a much better job of doing just that... and we'll try to track an even higher percentage next year!
