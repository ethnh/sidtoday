# (U) The UKUSA SIGINT Relationship 

FROM:
Deputy Special US Liaison Officer - London (D/SUSLOL)
Run Date: 07/06/2006
(S//SI) For half a century, our respective nations have benefited from the UKUSA SIGINT relationship begun during the Second World War. From the early days where we worked shoulder-to-shoulder at Bletchley Park, the relationship has grown in every facet of our profession, manifested today in our close collaboration at key locations like Benhall, Bude, Digby, and Menwith Hill in the UK and at Fort Meade, Fort Gordon, Medina, Denver, and soon to include Alaska in the US.
(S//SI) Today, US and UK military forces in harm's way are served by NSA Representatives, GCHQ Government Communication Officers, and integrees from both organizations, collaborating to provide timely, onsite support in the thick of battles in Iraq and Afghanistan.
(TS//SI) Our joint history is full of examples where, collectively, we provided better intelligence to UK and US policymakers and military commanders than we would have individually:

- keeping close watch on the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations throughout the Cold War
- supporting UK operations during the Falklands War
- leading the way for a broad coalition of partners during the Balkans crisis
- playing a critical role in the success of Desert Shield/Desert Storm
- monitoring for decades proliferation in all parts of the globe from China to Iran and Libya where SIGINT played a key role in discovering the AQ Khan network and bringing Libya to the nonproliferation negotiation table
- working to provide insights on crises in the Middle East, tensions between India and Pakistan in South Asia, international trafficking of narcotics, and most importantly today, on terrorism around the world.
(U//FOUO) Collectively, the UKUSA and Five Eyes partnership extends to every corner of the globe providing critical intelligence to help our nations' leaders make the world safer and more secure today and for future generations. The US Cryptologic Community takes great pride in being a part of this unique partnership.
