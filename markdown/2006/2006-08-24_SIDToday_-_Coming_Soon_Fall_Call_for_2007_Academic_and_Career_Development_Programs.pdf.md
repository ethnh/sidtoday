(U) Coming Soon: Fall Call for 2007 Academic and Career Development Programs

FROM:
SID Mission Interface for E\&T Issues (S01)
Run Date: 08/24/2006
(U) Are you interested in applying for external academic and career development programs? If so, watch for a SID announcement that will soon be released to the workforce soliciting nominations for a variety of training opportunities (see below for a listing of the programs).
(U) For FY 2007, SID senior management has made the decision to perform three calls for these academic developmental opportunities. As a result, calls will be made in the fall of 2006, with winter and spring calls in 2007. The first (i.e. fall) call will be released by the end of this month (August).
(U) The upcoming SID announcement will provide eligibility criteria for the various programs, instructions on how to apply, and guidance on how to submit applications. The SID senior management team will review nominations for these developmental programs collectively to facilitate selection of the best candidates for the most appropriate opportunity.

Note: SID personnel must ensure that their nominations are submitted in accordance with the SID internal deadline (which will be specified in the upcoming message) rather than Agency-announced program deadlines.
(U) If you meet the eligibility criteria and have your management's support, you are highly encouraged to apply for one or more of these career developmental opportunities.
(U/FOUO) Questions regarding this new process for these various training opportunities can be addressed to the SID Mission Interface (SMI) for Education and Training (POCs: $\square$
