(C) PKI technology proves low-cost method of allowing access by a wide variety of partners.
(U//FOUO) In response to guidance from the Director of National Intelligence to increase collaboration throughout the Intelligence Community (IC), the Overhead Collection Management Center (OCMC) recently transformed its NSAnet website into a powerful collaboration tool capable of protecting data, enabling multi-network access, and providing a web-based collaboration platform to support interaction between IC partners.
(C) As the Collection Management Authority for Overhead SIGINT, the OCMC needs to seamlessly interact with the National Reconnaissance Office, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and Second Party Partners across multiple IC networks such as NSAnet, INTELINK, and NGAnet. To meet these collaboration needs, the OCMC upgraded their website to host a "Horizontal Integration Secure Collaboration" library that allows partners to upload, publish, and collaborate on documents of all classification levels through the use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology. PKI technology allows multi-level access control and screens data from users based on verified security credentials and nationality.
(U//FOUO) Lessons learned from this low-cost initiative are being applied to current multimillion dollar acquisitions to reduce risk, cost, and development time.
