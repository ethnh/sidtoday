(S//SI//REL USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL, HUN) The Russia Production Center/SIGINT Development Division has turned to NSA's trusted Central European partner -- the Hungarian Military Intelligence Office (MIO) -- to foster a growing target-development relationship and forestall the steady decline of access to high priority Russian targets from both First and Second Party sites. Over the past few years, Russia/SIGDEV has coordinated with the MIO and with European Technical Center (ETC) personnel to conduct survey analysis with the goal of determining how this new SIGDEV relationship can ensure future access to desired targets.
(S//SI//REL USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL, HUN) The growing cooperation between the partners recently culminated in the first-ever visit of two MIO analysts to NSA HQ for a six-day "SIGDEV Bootcamp," a learning experience developed by Russia/SIGDEV analysts to demonstrate an effective approach to accessing the target and doing efficient selection and filtering of collected data, i.e., narrowing the huge collection funnel by means of metadata analysis of DNR (Dialed Number Recognition) and DNI (Digital Network Intelligence) material.

SIGDEV Strategy and Governance (SSG) as well as Ukraine, Balkans and Russia target analysts also took part in this initiative. A copy of the presentations will be placed on CD and pouched to the MIO for future reference.
(S//SI//REL USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL, HUN) In addition to the sessions at NSAW, the MIO visit was highlighted by two days at Yakima Research Station. The site briefings and demos focused on many of the latest foreign-satellite survey and analysis tools, which are slated for installation at the MIO in the near future.

(S//SI//REL USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL, HUN) As members of a five-person SRTD (Signals Research and Target Development) team that supports the entire MIO Organization, the Hungarian visitors were impressive in their expertise, breadth of knowledge and technical knowhow. Each one plays a multi-disciplined role, fulfilling the duties of intelligence analyst, signals analyst, collector, and collection manager. While the MIO is much smaller in size with less capability than NSA, what they lack in numbers they quickly make up for in ingenuity and creativity. The visitors eagerly shared their own insights and techniques, such as writing software for their own analytic tools to solve SRTD problems.
(S//SI//REL USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL, HUN) Russia/ SIGDEV continues to value this relationship with MIO; the open exchange and sharing during the Bootcamp have helped solidify the development of a strong working partnership. Russia/ SIGDEV also eagerly awaits the second phase of a planned COMSAT survey - a chance to put Bootcamp knowledge into practice and the next step in moving toward access and exploitation of desired Russian target sets. The survey, initially to be held in fall 2006, will probably be scheduled for early 2007 with the support of Musketeer, ETC, MIO and Russia/ SIGDEV personnel for search, survey, and on-site content and metadata analysis.
