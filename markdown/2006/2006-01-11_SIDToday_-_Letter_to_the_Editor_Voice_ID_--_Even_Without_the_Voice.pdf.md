(S) Here's a comment on the article "Technology That Identifies People by the Sound of Their Voices" :

# Comment: 

(S) I don't know how effective automatic voice ID will become, but here's a story showing what old-fashioned voice identification by linguists can do:
(C) A linguist colleague of mine once informed his supervisor that their target (I'll call him Terrorist X) had made a phone call to his accomplice, but the accomplice didn't answer.
(C) The supervisor said, "If nobody answered, how do you know it was Terrorist X that was calling?"
My colleague answered, "While the phone was ringing, he cleared his throat."
-- $\square$
