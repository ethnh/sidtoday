(S//REL) The overarching theme for this conference is centered on the evolving role of Overhead (OH) in the broader SIGINT Enterprise. Key components of this theme are challenges of integrating OH SIGINT with other Access Providers and OH's SIGINT response to new and emerging targets. Additionally, WOHC-06 will highlight the transformation of the end-to-end OH SIGINT collection management process and the partnerships that allow for worldwide OH collection opportunities in support of the nation and our allies. WOHC-06 is further designed to provide a forum for information exchange and dialogue on current and future OH SIGINT collection initiatives. The target audience for WOHC-06 encompasses the following:

- Working and mid-level collection and mission managers within the OH SIGINT Enterprise;
- Stakeholders from the Extended Enterprise to include, but not limited to, the S1/S2/S3 elements at NSAW and the Cryptologic Centers (CCs);
- GCHQ and DSD Headquarters elements; and
- DoD elements involved in collection management activities.
(S//REL) The conference format affords the opportunity to receive briefings on new and emerging OH SIGINT capabilities. Additionally significant emphasis will be placed on conduct of interactive workshops, where participants can expect to learn how the overhead enterprise is postured today and how we intend to serve our customers better in the future.
(S//REL) WOHC-06 organizers are currently soliciting candidate briefings and workshop topics -- please feel free to submit any ideas to 0000000000000 for consideration. Primary POC for WOHC-06 is Mr. Scott Thayer, Chief, Office of Overhead.
