(U) SID Around the World: A Glimpse of Utah

FROM:
URLC Operational Staff Officer

(U//FOUO) Did you know that NSA SIGINTers are living and working in Utah (at the Utah Regional Language Center - URLC)? Here's a taste of what life is like there:
(U) Utah has much to offer. While you can't get the whole picture in just one page from just one person, I offer you a glimpse of my Utah.
(U) My first look at Utah was from the dusty lanes of Interstate 15. As a child, my family drove from our home in southern California to Bryce Canyon National Park. Apart from the soggy sandwich and squabbles with my big brother, I recall a mile-long tunnel, beautiful red rocks, and wonderful views.
(U) I traveled Interstate 15 many more times over the years and the landmarks were always the same: Joshua trees in Apple Valley, the strip in Las Vegas, the red cliffs at St. George, and the manicured farmlands stretched out under the Wasatch Mountains as we rolled into Utah County.
(U) As a college student in Utah, my experiences were off the beaten path. I explored underground caves, climbed the 11,000ft peak of Mount Timpanogos, drove in the Moab Jeep Safari, cycled to Balancing Rock, hiked to Rainbow Bridge at Lake Powell, soaked in natural hot springs, skied at resorts, and drove four wheelers through the back country of Uinta National Forest. All of these experiences left vivid and lasting impressions on me.
(U) Dating introduced me to cultural opportunities in Utah. I admit to enjoying at least parts of an opera at Salt Lake City's Abravanel Hall, and most of a symphony. I liked all of Handel's Messiah at the Mormon Tabernacle, and who wouldn't enjoy fine dining at the top of the Joseph Smith building with its view of the Salt Lake Temple. Equally impressive was the after-dinner stroll through half a million Christmas lights on its grounds. When it came to ballets, I passed, but James Taylor at the Sundance outdoor amphitheater on a warm summer night -- now that's a memory!
(U) After five years away, my return to Utah has been somewhat nostalgic. Though I am not as adventurous as I was before, I still love to get outdoors. My son and I like to fish and explore along streams, and our family always takes the scenic drive through the Alpine Loop in October when the leaves are at full color. My wife gets a lot of mileage out of the zoo and the library near our home. As I've matured, I have gained an appreciation for local history, such as events commemorating the pioneers' arrival into the valley and a living history museum in the spirit of Williamsburg.

(U) For me, one of the best parts about Utah is being back along Interstate 15.

I'm happy to report that the landmarks appear just as faithfully in reverse order.
