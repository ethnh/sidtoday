(U//FOUO) I attended the Joint IED Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) worldwide Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) Analyst Summit at the Annapolis Junction L-3Comm/Titan facility, between 28 February and 2 March. This OSD*-sponsored event brought together close to 200 intelligence analysts and engineers from the Department of Defense, Military Services, Intelligence Community, and Law Enforcement communities. Additionally, allied representation included military and civilian members from Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and Israel.
(U//FOUO) The summit sought to establish five goals vis-Ã -vis the IED problem set:

1. Establish a community of interest
2. Establish a collaborative environment
3. Facilitate a common understanding of the problem set
4. Identify gaps and seams
5. Identify priorities of effort
(U//FOUO) A diverse speaker base, to include academia, provided technical and informational briefings on topics from analytical tools/techniques to the "demanding variables of the worldwide IED battle space;" from global Salafi terrorism through the Israeli perspective on countering IEDs and terrorism. All analysts came away with a greater appreciation for the complexity of this global problem. This forum provided an excellent opportunity to forge collaborative ties with a very diverse analyst population.
