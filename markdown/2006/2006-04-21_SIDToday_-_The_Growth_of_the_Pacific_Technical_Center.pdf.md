(U//FOUO) The Growth of the Pacific Technical Center
FROM:
Chief, Pacific Technical Center
Run Date: 04/21/2006
(U//FOUO) In early 2003, SID leadership announced their support for the establishment of the Pacific Technical Center, co-located with NSA/CSS Representative Japan (NCRJ) at Yokota Air Base, outside of Tokyo.
(U//FOUO) Recognizing that world events and new strategic thrusts demanded additional investments of funding and manpower in support of the PTC mission, the SID Director specifically tasked NCRJ leadership to identify what resources would be required for PTC to operate in the Pacific Theater the way ETC operates in the European Theater. Without hesitation, NCRJ and PTC leadership engaged and began building a cadre of professionals responsible for providing cryptologic technical and logistical services second to none in the Pacific AOR. The PTC is organized into four distinct branches; Systems Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering, Computer Science and Defense Communications Detachment Okinawa (DCDO).
(S//SI) The PTC Systems Engineering branch is the cornerstone for supporting NSAW Data Acquisition (S3) initiatives and providing technical support to the entire Pacific theater and its cooperating SIGINT 1st, 2nd and 3rd Party affiliates. A team of 28 highly skilled NSA civilians, joint-military personnel, and Japanese Master Labor Contractors (MLC's) have set the benchmark in the areas of Antenna Design, Fabrication and Certification, RF System Survey, Installation, Repair and Maintenance, Electronic Component Manufacturing and Signals Search and Survey.
(TS//SI) The PTC Telecom Engineering branch has developed into the focal point for implementing ITD solutions throughout the Pacific theater. With a team of 12 telecommunications, network engineers and installation specialists, PTC Telecom Engineering extends beyond Japan to provide and sustain the telecommunications services supporting SIGINT missions in Australia, Alaska, Thailand, Hawaii, India, Korea, Taiwan, Guam, Diego Garcia, and the Philippines. PTC is employing both traditional telecom and new IP-based networking to transform NSA's IT infrastructure to a reliable and agile network to meet constantly evolving mission requirements.
(S//SI) The PTC Computer Support branch is the ITD enabler for the Asia/Pacific Region. A cadre of 13 IT professionals provide Software Infrastructure and Mission Support services to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Party customers. They are recognized subject-matter experts in Computer Administration, Dataflow and Software Support.
(TS//SI) The Defense Communications Detachment Okinawa (DCDO) is an NSA facility, managed under the cognizance of PTC, and currently maintained and operated through Corporate HF Services (S3311). It is staffed with two NSA personnel, seventeen Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. employees, and thirty-one Japanese Master Labor Contractors. The mission systems at DCDO are an integral part of the US Cryptologic System (USCS) and significantly contribute to SIGINT collection against high-value PRC targets of interest. The facility is scheduled to relocate under Project CAMELUS in CY06. (See a background article .)
(U//FOUO) As the PTC expansion of personnel, space and IT infrastructure continues, the PTC customer base, operational footprint, and improvements in the area of Customer Outreach and Feedback have also continued to grow. In order to effectively manage this expansion, the Mission Integration Center (MIC) was formed. The MIC will serve to focus PTC resources to meet mission needs, to the maximum benefit of the United States Cryptologic System. Specifically, the MIC will formalize the tasking and requirements process, link resource management with mission priorities, improve Stakeholder relations, and provide leadership for configuration control and standardized system documentation.
