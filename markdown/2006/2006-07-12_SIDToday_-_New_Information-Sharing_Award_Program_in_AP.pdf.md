(U) New Information-Sharing Award Program in A\&P

FROM: Cindy Farkus
Assistant Deputy Director for Analysis \& Production (S2)
Run Date: 07/12/2006
(U) I am very excited about a new information-sharing incentive. It is a program that will give your supervisors a new and in some cases more lucrative way to reward your efforts to collaborate. While the existing A\&P Awards Program includes collaboration as one of eight encouraged behaviors, we thought it important to put extra emphasis on sharing information for analytic collaboration. Many A\&P offices routinely collaborate with their partners and customers, and gain great improvements in the intelligence they provide to their customers. This new award program enables all participants in a collaborative relationship (linguists, analysts, reporters, managers, enablers etc.) to be recognized.
(U) Options for recognition under this program include monetary and non-monetary awards, military awards, and honorary awards. Examples include:

- Time-Off Awards,
- Letters of Appreciation,
- Special Passes/Liberty,
- Letters of Commendation,
- Joint Service Achievement Medals, and
- Special Act Awards.

Awardees might get recognized for implementing a process improvement for collaboration within their team/branch, implementing a culture change, breaking down barriers to collaboration (technical, political, cultural), acting as change agent or mentor, developing a Collaboration Plan, etc.
(U) You will begin seeing reminders and "signs" of encouragement in the coming days, but the first awards under this program will be submitted starting in October. In the meantime, take a look at the program description (type " go infoshare" in your web browser). There you can also find InfoShare Primers on ways to get started, one for analysts and one for managers. If you have any questions about the program, please call the Information Sharing Team on $\square$ s.
