(U) Write Right: The Paperless Society

FROM:
of the Reporting Board (S12)
Run Date: 04/27/2006
(U) A recent request to settle a reporting format disagreement was accompanied by the information that a working aid from 1998 differed from one on the same topic from 2005. We confess to being packrats ourselves, but we were very surprised that someone of our persuasion would have overlooked the standard notice on the newer document that "this version contains all updates."
(U) This is a somewhat extreme case, but similar requests come in often enough (see Reporting Forum issue RF-003-05, on relying on outdated guidance) that a plea to reporters to consider throwing out all those old hard-copy policy and guidance memos seems in order.
(U) Not all of them, of course; we agree with the cynic who said that the paperless office was about as likely as the paperless restroom. Some documents are classics of their kind, as anyone who has a copy, hard or soft, of the old B Group Reporting Guidelines from the '90s knows. It's one of the best and most succinct summaries of principles of reporting around, and is being reviewed for updating of details before being posted on The Reporting Page.
(U) Other documents such as hard-copy memos contain information that can be extremely useful in tracing the line of reasoning that led to a particular decision or directive, or are handy references when disagreements arise about procedures ("we used to do just the opposite, what happened?"). Just make sure you don't cite outdated guidance. The most up-to-date information on reporting policy, as on personnel, training, IT support, etc., is on NSA WebWorld. Feel free to print copies for your own use (we too find it hard to read half a dozen screen windows at once), but check frequently to make sure you have the latest information.
