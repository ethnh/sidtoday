(S//SI//REL) New HF Collection System Installed on Korean Island FROM:
Special US Liaison Advisor - Korea (SUSLAK)
Run Date: $12 / 13 / 2006$
(S//SI//REL) Tons of equipment airlifted to remote island of Ulleung Do.
(S//SI//REL) General Dynamics contractors recently completed the installation of a fifth CHARTVEIN system, this one at Defense Security Agency (DSA, our Korean partner) collection site R-502, on the Island of Ulleung Do. CHARTVEIN is a cost-shared, multifunctional HF collection, DF and signal processing system that will update Korean and US capabilities against modern HF signals. The installation was completed ahead of schedule in spite of the size and complexity of the CHARTVEIN system and the remoteness of the collection site.

(S//SI//REL) The SUSLAK Engineering Systems Support Branch (ESSB) accompanied the onsite support representative to Ulleung Do to verify the correct completion of three of the nine antenna pads and antenna support pads for the new CHARTVEIN system being installed there. CHARTVEIN engineers also conducted a site survey in preparation for the system's installation in the newly completed operations building. ESSB also orchestrated the loading and unloading of 18 crates aboard two helicopters to ship CHARTVEIN equipment to Ulleung Do. The last six crates were shipped to the island on 26 September, and the CHARTVEIN installation team began installing the system.
(S//SI//REL) The DSA fixed collection site on the remote island of Ulleung Do, where the CHARTVEIN system was installed.
(S//SI//REL) The SUSLAK Installations \& Logistics Branch provided special support to the Engineering Systems Service Branch and teamed with the DSA Logistics Division to facilitate the movement of 18 crates of CHARTVEIN equipment from the DSA Headquarters to the Seoul Air Base. The crates totaled more that 15,000 pounds, and they were airlifted by the 17th Aviation Bde to the South Korean island of Ulleungdo, located in the East Sea.

(S//SI//REL) This effort was part of phase two of the CHARTVEIN install project, and with it, both SUSLAK and DSA anticipate a large increase in valuable intelligence. Although the site won't officially be on line for another couple of weeks, data is already being received from the system. A team from NSAW is coming to Korea to observe, check and test the system. The official acceptance test took place the week of 6 November and, the site became fully operational shortly thereafter.
