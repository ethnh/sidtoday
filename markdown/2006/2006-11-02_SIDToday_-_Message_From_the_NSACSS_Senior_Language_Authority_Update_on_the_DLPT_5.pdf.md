(U) Message From the NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority: Update on the DLPT 5

FROM: Cheryl Houser
NSA/CSS Senior Language Authority (SLA)
Run Date: 11/02/2006
(U//FOUO) The implementation of the Defense Language Proficiency Test* (DLPT 5) as the new test of record for cryptologic language proficiency testing and the introduction of required retesting** for civilian cryptologic language analysts has been difficult and challenging. Both the new format of the test and the focus on global proficiency have added additional stress in an already high-paced and stressful environment. The results of these new assessments, though not unexpected, have not all been as high as we have achieved in the past. We are committed to ensuring that the assessments truly reflect our Agency's capability in foreign language proficiency and that our workforce has the tools and assistance it needs to demonstrate this proficiency.
(U//FOUO) I have asked NSA/CSS Georgia Associate Language Authority (USLLA) and the Senior Language Advisor for Arabic (AAS) to gather the necessary information to identify the specific obstacles, difficulties and challenges in adapting to the new testing system and provide solutions and approaches that will ensure that our language analysts continue to be recognized and rewarded for the skills and knowledge they bring to the SIGINT disciplines. They will be focusing on the effects of retesting on the Agency's Arabic language population as a case study, but the results of their work are expected to have applicability to the experiences of the other language groups.
(U//FOUO) We will publish regular updates on their work and encourage you to contact them (C) (C) to share your experiences, concerns and suggestions.
