# (U) Have You Ever Met a US President? 

FROM: SIGINT Communications
Unknown
Run Date: 02/15/2006
(U) Aside from seeing a President when he visited NSA, have you ever had a chance encounter with a U.S. President? With the President's Day holiday coming up, SID today thought it would be interesting to hear about employees' stories along these lines.
(U) Perhaps you were jogging on the Mall in DC and came across President Carter or Clinton? Did you exchange words with Richard Nixon once in California? Let us know! Just write a couple of paragraphs relating what happened and send it to $\square$ @nsa and $\square$ @nsa. If we get a few anecdotes, we'll post them in an article.
(U) We published some NSAer memories of President Reagan shortly after he passed away: "(U) In SID er's View of History: Meeting President Reagan" .
(U) You may also want to check out the Thanksgiving stories we posted in November.
(U) You never know who you will run into in Washington...
