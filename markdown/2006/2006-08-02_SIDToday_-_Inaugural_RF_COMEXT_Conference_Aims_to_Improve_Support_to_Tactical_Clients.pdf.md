(S//SI) The synergy between Technical SIGINT and Geospatial analysis was most evident at the inaugural Radio Frequency (RF) Communications Externals (COMEXT) conference held at NSA/CSS Colorado in Denver in June. What is RF COMEXT? Simply put, it is external communications parameters associated with an RF emission. Why are consumers asking for this data? Tactical planners and operators need this data so that they can quickly know the identification and location of emitters in a given environment in order to support troops in theater as well as operational planning.
(S//S) The conference, championed by the RF COMEXT Center in Denver, provided an excellent venue for robust information exchange and dialog on how to mature the RF COMEXT mission to allow us to provide unique, discrete, and accurate RF emitter locations in geographic context. Attendance included representatives from each of the cryptologic centers, many intelligence community partners, and other stakeholders around the enterprise, and the level of attendance and participation was truly reflective of community and organizational interest in advancing this mission area.
(S//SI) The theme of the conference was " Consolidation of the Communication Externals Enterprise ," with the focus on validating the need to further develop the RF COMEXT mission, sharing information about mission-related activities currently underway across the community, and developing a mandate for further advancing this mission in a collaborative and transparent manner. The conference achieved all of this, and more.
(S//SI) The call for action from the conference participants was loud and clear - the need for capabilities, tools, policies, and training topped the list of issues raised throughout the sessions. With COMEXT historically being a by-product of COMINT-collected data, the challenge is to insure that COMEXT-specific data collection; storage, manipulation, and forwarding requirements on the SIGINT system are satisfied in the context of NSA's corporate architecture plans. Using a consumer-centric model, and an existing COMEXT tier structure, the foundations have been established for future success.
(S//SI) My keynote address at the conference was the perfect occasion to highlight the opportunities Transformation 3.0 provides to advance the RF COMEXT mission. They included the opportunity to:

- Develop collaborative and integrated information management systems compatible with Agency standards and structures;
- Develop common RF COMEXT data stores and tagging systems;
- Provide rapid response through the use of technology enhancements and process development;
- Build greater efficiencies by discovering and capitalizing on the commonalities between COMEXT, ELINT, and FIS; and
- Perform comprehensive analysis, using TechSIG and GEO disciplines that include multiple sources and transparency across the enterprise.
(U//FOUO) The conference participants left the session energized to move forward in further developing the RF COMEXT mission. Hats off to MAJ and his team, who did a fantastic job in organizing and leading this exciting activity.
