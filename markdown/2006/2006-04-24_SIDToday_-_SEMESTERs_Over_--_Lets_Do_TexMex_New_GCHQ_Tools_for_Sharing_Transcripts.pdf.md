(C) SEMESTER's Over -- Let's Do TexMex: New GCHQ Tools for Sharing Transcripts

FROM:
NSA integree to GCHQ
Run Date: $04 / 24 / 2006$
(C) New tools are now available to allow Voice Language Analysts at NSA and GCHQ (the UK's Government Communications HQ) to collaborate directly. A demonstration of these tools will be held at Ft Meade in early May.
(C) The word "TexMex" conjures up for many the spicy cuisine and lively music of the Southwestern United States. Project TexMex, however, comes not from the arid deserts of the Mexican borderland, but from the green and fertile plains of England, from NSA's closest SIGINT partner, GCHQ. TexMex is an acronym for Transcription EXchange, Modernization and EXpansion
(S) TexMex came about when NSA announced in 2003 that it would be decommissioning SEMESTER, the UNIX-based computer system used for over 20 years by NSA, GCHQ, CSE (Canada) and other SIGINT partners. In order to preserve and enhance the close collaboration and divisions of effort enabled over the years via SEMESTER, GCHQ took the lead* in developing a web-based replacement tool which would allow collaboration not only on traditional targets, such as MENA, Balkans, and Russian Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF), but across all SIGINT production areas and targets.
(C) Early this year, GCHQ analysts began using a TexMex tool called Crest Lite to peer into NSA's Crest repository of voice, fax, and C2C transcripts. Starting just last month, NSA analysts began using the TexMex tool Leptonyx Lite to review similar transcripts in GCHQ's Leptonyx repository. The TexMex tools have several advantages over their SEMESTER predecessor, such as the ability to search a complete pool of transcripts and built-in feedback buttons allowing interested analysts to contact their colleagues who originated the transcripts. As of now, TexMex is in use at GCHQ and NSA, and could in principle be made available to the other SIGINT Second Parties as well.
(C) With the deployment of these "Lite" tools, voice, fax and translations of C2C intercept from a much wider range of targets will now be available to share among all analysts at NSA and GCHQ. This may be a new way of working for some, but it fulfills the vision of the Second Party SIGINT Directors, including MG Quirk, that we move to a Need to Share, not Need to Know ** environment. Increased collaboration will bring a host of advantages, such as allowing greater flexibility in drawing up divisions of effort, jumpstarting new dialogues, and making it easier for linguists to share expertise. For this to work, TexMex will require the commitment of workinglevel analysts on both sides of the pond.
(C) Analysts, how can you get started? Come see TexMex tools demonstrated at the 4th Annual NSA Advanced Analysis Laboratory Analysis Conference, May 1 - 4, 2006. Or request a tailored demonstration during that period from ( ) or ( ) or ( ) , who will be tdy from Cheltenham to provide training.
