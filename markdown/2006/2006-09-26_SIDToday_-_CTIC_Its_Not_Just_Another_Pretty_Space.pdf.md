(U//FOUO) CTIC: It's Not Just Another Pretty Space
FROM: the Counterterrorism Primary Production Center (S2I) Unknown
Run Date: 09/26/2006
(U//FOUO) Okay, the Counterterrorism Innovation Center (CTIC) is different. And a bit disruptive. CTIC looks and feels like a design studio, recreation room, tradeshow floor, cognitive systems lab and Internet caf√© all rolled into one. Its main function, however, is pretty simple: CTIC is a place where the right mix of people and technology can help us imagine better ways of doing our work and help validate various technical approaches to getting it done.
(U//FOUO) The CTIC has three main focus areas. It is:

1. an innovation center where analysts can come together to discover and create new approaches to a problem;
2. a transformation center where analysts can "test-drive" high-powered tools not previously available to the government, to see how we can use them to improve our analytic horsepower; and
3. a germination center where analysts can find new ways to use existing tools that have a proven value in another, specific arena of NSA's business.
(U//FOUO) There are plenty of great ideas out there, and a lot of problem-solving already underway. Part of CTIC's mission is to amplify and focus such efforts while building a foundation to tackle bigger, systemic issues.
(U//FOUO) Some of those bigger issues are grouped around target technology themes like the following:

- (S//SI) Contributing to the development of VoiceRT, a voice-services platform. Initially VoiceRT will focus on voice keyword search technology and then expand to other applications such as speaker and language identification. (See related article .)
- (C//REL) Persona Analysis and Tracking Techniques ( PATT ): PATT intends to translate data into information sets that analysts can readily absorb, and create data summarization presentations, such as a summary of a target's activity online.
- (U//FOUO) The CTIC will foster visual analytics innovation. "Visual analytics" is a new term coined for an old concept - that humans are optimized to make judgments on visual data.
- (U//FOUO) Workflow Management - i.e. efficiently managing those sets of processes and functions required to fulfill our daily tasks. In the CTIC we will develop technical solutions so that analysts are relieved from manual processes, such as data entry and working in multiple GUI's (graphical user interfaces), by giving them a fully automated workspace.
(U//FOUO) CTIC project teams study specific issues, characterize gaps and shortfalls, imagine possible solutions, and recommend mature commercial- and government-off-the-shelf (COTS, GOTS) technologies for evaluation. Other projects, organized around themes like analytic integration and customer interaction, are intended to lay the foundation for improvements in collaboration techniques and higher-level analysis.
