(U) A Small Partnership? Perhaps, But Everything is Big in Texas!

(S//SI) NSA recently concluded a successful program review with our SIGINT partners in the Republic of Croatia, which will likely lead to a moderate expansion in our partnership that is firmly grounded in sharing intelligence on the Balkans target sets. The conference included a tour of the Cryptologic Museum, an afternoon at the National Cryptologic School, and a brief visit to NSA/CSS Texas for a mission overview and specific discussions with target analysts.

(S//SI) $\square$ (S) $\square$ Assistant Director for Technical Matters within the Croatian Intelligence Agency (OA) and leader of the six-person Croat delegation, was extremely pleased with the agenda, the results of the program review, and the interaction between the NSA and OA personnel. He thanked all of the briefers and the organizations that hosted the Croatian delegation. He also held out hope that the OA soon may receive legal authority to target international transit traffic, which could give them access to traffic of possible interest to NSA offices working transnational targets. Highlights from the program review include:

- Proposals from the OA to conduct joint surveys of newly found signals at four Croatian collection sites; the Balkans Divison (S2A5) is interested in these signals and would support surveys because they believe sustained collection may provide valuable intelligence on Montenegrin leadership, PIFWCs (persons indicted for war crimes) and human trafficking in the Balkans;
- NSA's offer to provide training in advanced DNR (dialed number recognition) techniques, reporting and signals analysis;
- An overview of NSA's "Follow The Money" target and $\square$ s promise to discuss FTM with his peers and determine whether the OA has information they can share with NSA on this target;
- An explanation of the ZORI RASIN Manual and how it will help the OA classify signals so that NSA and the OA can use identical terminology when discussing signals;
- An executive overview and operational briefings at NSA/CSS Texas; and
- A discussion concerning increased exchange of metadata and analytic information using the BAYBRIDGE circuit.
(S//SI) During their off hours, the Croats were treated to a tour of Washington DC, a tour of San Antonio's River Walk, and a tour of the Alamo. In Texas, a couple of the visitors purchased cowboy boots and one bought a Stetson (of course, the traditional "good guy" white hat). Before leaving Maryland, they treated NSA personnel to an informal dinner at Duclaw's in the Arundel Mills shopping center and the following evening they were the honored guests at an official dinner hosted by Fran Fleisch, the Foreign Affairs Directorate's Assistant Director for SIGINT Operations. In San Antonio, the Vice Commander of NSA/CSS Texas, took them to a superb restaurant on the River Walk where the visitors all ordered Texas steaks!
