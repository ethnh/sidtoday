(U) The NSA/CSS Texas Joint Training Center Opens: A Major Step Forward for Operations

FROM: $\square$ Chief, Communications/Public Affairs/Policy, NSA/CSS Texas
and $\square$ Multimedia, NSA/CSS Texas
Run Date: $01 / 05 / 2006$
(U) Here's the latest quarterly update from NSA/CSS Texas...
(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS Texas now has a first class training facility - the NSA/CSS Texas Joint Training Center, which officially opened on 30 November 2005. It represents a major step forward in providing unique training opportunities to our workforce, and particularly to those working in Operations. As pictured below, NSA/CSS Texas Commander Col. James Marrs, Education and Training Director, and Dean of Cryptology/National Cryptologic School/NSAW jointly cut the ribbon signifying the official opening of the new building.
(U) Col. Marrs and $\square$ made opening remarks and acknowledgments; and delivered the keynote address. He focused on the development of a strategy for all cryptologic center training and educational programs.
(U//FOUO) The 23,000 square foot facility allows NSA/CSS Texas to maximize use of the classrooms and computer labs, equipped with the latest technology, and provide essential "just-in-time" training. Specialized classrooms will now be able to provide signals development, language, analysis and information technology training, all of which are skills critical to the performance of the Operations mission. The Signals Development Center Lab is a highlight, and offers a new dimension in training which was previously not available. Scheduling difficulties and limited classroom space, major issues of the past, are now virtually eliminated.
(U//FOUO) Instructors are now available for Languages, Intelligence Analysis and Signals Analysis. Offerings will include:

- Career and Professional Development programs,
- 12-week language proficiency enhancement programs,
- 5-week advanced courses and 4-week intermediate courses in key languages.
- The DIA Intermediate Terrorism course with a SIGINT slant (offered for the first time locally).
(U//FOUO) As we build out within the extended enterprise, the true value of this facility will be measured by the higher quality of productivity among members of the NSA/CSS SID Operations Directorate; and, the corresponding higher level of capability and support that the enabling organizations can be expected to provide.
(U) The significance of this event was underscored by the presence of several notable officials, including Mr. Daniel Mezza, Regional Director from U.S. Senator John Cornyn's (R-Texas) office, who presented a Letter of Recognition on behalf of the Senator. Two former Medina Regional Security Operations Center (MRSOC) commanders were also in attendance, along with both the Chief, and Deputy Chief of Cryptologic Training Systems at NSAW.
(U) Tours of the facility, with its state-of-the-art technology, followed the opening. Visitors were impressed by the smart boards and improved language training equipment available for use. Positive comments on the new equipment and the upgraded spaces could be heard throughout the NSA/CSS Texas compound. Both students and adjunct faculty members were inspired by the prospect of learning and teaching in the new building.
(U) Col. Marrs accurately described the potential of the new Joint Training Center when he stated, "...the future education of our warfighters and workforce has entered the twenty first century."
