(U//FOUO) The Institute for Analysis (IFA)* is bringing some exciting events to the analytic community and hopes you are able to participate:

# (U) The Future of Borders 

(U) On 16 November, Dr. Jesse Goldhammer, a senior practitioner at Global Business Network, will present a briefing on The Future of Borders . The IFA has just completed an eight-month study of the driving forces that are transforming international borders and fundamentally changing the global security landscape for the United States. This briefing will outline these changes and will present an analytical framework - designed for intelligence analysts - that provides an alternative approach to generating actionable intelligence for known and unknown border-related threats.
(U//FOUO) Following the briefing, there will be a moderated discussion on the implications of the findings for the US intelligence, military and law enforcement communities. It will be held at the Bethesda Suite Marriott in Bethesda, MD on November 16th, from 10:00am-1:00pm. A light lunch will be provided for $\$ 10.00$. The Advanced Analysis Lab will be arranging for a van or bus to the Marriott.

## (U) Asking Better Questions Pilot

(U//FOUO) From 14-16 November, the Institute for Analysis, in conjunction with the National Cryptologic School, will be piloting a new seminar entitled "Asking Better Questions ." In this three-day course, analysts will learn how to improve the quality of their communication, analysis, and reporting through the process of asking better questions.
(U//FOUO) This process is designed to increase the "fitness for use" of the data and analysis for the customer's needs. Through pre-work and homework (2-3 hours total), individual exercises, group activities, and dynamic multi-media presentations, attendees will learn how improve the fitness for use of the analysis process by asking better questions of customers, asking better questions of themselves, and asking better questions of their analysis and reports. This new course is not yet listed in the ELM system, so please contact $\square$ by email to register for the course. Homework assignments and more specific logistical information will be provided in early November. (This seminar will be offered at NSA/Hawaii, NSA/Texas, NSA/Georgia and NSA/Colorado during FY07 so stay tuned for scheduling at your respective enterprise sites.)

## (U) Presentation on the Future of Latin America Using Scenario Thinking

(U) On Wednesday, 6 December, Peter Schwartz, noted futurist and Chairman of the Global Business Network, will describe four unclassified provocative scenarios for how leftism, populism, and anti-Americanism in Latin America could develop in the next 10 years in ways that matter to the U.S. The presentation will include a number of video dramatizations that powerfully convey the possible scenarios. Mr. Schwartz will also speak to the power of scenaric thinking to address complex and fundamentally uncertain questions related to national security. The presentation is intended for managers and senior managers in the intelligence community and military, as well as Latin America specialists in other parts of the government.
(U//FOUO) This presentation will be held at the Pooks Hill Marriott in Bethesda, MD on December 6th, from 10:00am-1:00pm. Check-in will start at 9:30 am. A light lunch will be provided for $\$ 10.00$. The Advanced Analysis Lab will be arranging for a van or bus to the

# (U)"The Internet, Netizens, and Narrative" 

(U) On Wednesday, 13 December the Institute for Analysis will be sponsoring a presentation by John Rendon, entitled " The Internet, Netizens, and Narrative ."
(U) John Rendon, CEO and president of the Rendon Group, says the Internet should be viewed as a new country, without borders or boundaries, whose only passport is technology. He also says that understanding the Internet and its components, both human and technological, is essential to providing predictive intelligence. In his presentation, Rendon will place in context recent changes in the Internet and the social impact these changes have as it relates to intelligence work. He will talk about the self-identifying characteristics of netizens, and how technology has opened up new forms of affiliation and new forms of social networks -- some helpful and some harmful.
(U) He will also address how the narratives produced and spread by these networks gain prominence and become viral - and even enter the mainstream, making them very hard to disassemble. In selected cases, social networks can produce negatively corrosive content that could lead to malevolent self-organizing systems. As these networks and the technology that enables them evolve, so too must the way in which they are watched, analyzed, and assessed by the Intelligence Community. Rendon will also talk about how open-source information can be tied to intelligence data in an actionable way to be made more effective.
(U) John Rendon is CEO and president of the Rendon Group and a self-described "information warrior." John is recognized internationally as an experienced and innovative strategic communications planner and operator. He is a leading advocate of new and emerging technologies that are changing the way individuals, agencies, and organizations observe, analyze, and communicate information. John has served as a senior communications consultant to the White House, the U.S. Department of Defense, senior government and military officials in the U.S. and internationally, and to Fortune 500 companies. He is a participant in forwardthinking organizations such as the Highlands Forum and the Aspen Institute, and is a contributor at key international strategic communications forums. Considered an authority on the real-time global information environment, John lectures on strategic communications, international campaign management, and crisis management at universities worldwide.
(U//FOUO) Mr. Rendon's presentation will take place in OPS2, 2B4118-6 from 1000-1130. Please RSVP by e-mail to $\square$ . If you have any questions or need any clarifications, please do not hesitate to contact $\square$
