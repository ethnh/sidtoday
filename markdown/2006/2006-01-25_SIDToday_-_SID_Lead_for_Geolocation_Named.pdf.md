# (S//SI) SID Lead for Geolocation Named 

FROM: Jim Cusick
Acting SIGINT Deputy Director
Run Date: 01/25/2006
(S//SI) The ability to geolocate targets has become a vital component of the SIGINT mission and its support of the war on terrorism. In order to effectively and efficiently provide this service, SID has determined we need central oversight and prioritization across the extended enterprise. As a result, I recently established the position of SID Geolocation Lead, with $\square$--who has been leading geolocation efforts in Data Acquisition -- now stepping into this role for SID.
(S//SI) $\square$ s job is not intended to supersede any geolocation initiatives already happening in SID, but rather to identify ways to strengthen our current operations and to find ways to improve NSA's ability to locate targets in future. As SID's Geolocation Lead, he will:

- (S//SI) Define a long term, comprehensive geolocation strategy;
- (S//SI) Produce a plan for managing our current geolocation capability gaps by setting priorities and making the best use of resources;
- (C) Shape and influence corporate policy for geolocation that will allow the broadest possible dissemination of geolocation technology and information.
(S//SI) One of $\square$ 's initial tasks will be to serve on the SID GEOLOCATION Integrated Process Team (IPT) formed at the request of MG Quirk and headed by Cyndi Beck, the Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO) Global Capabilities Manager. The GEOLOCATION IPT is working to ensure that all analysts have access to as much available geolocational data as possible via SIGINT databases. Accordingly, this group is now baselining existing geolocational data in order to make recommendations for action -- this effort will contribute to the broader Geolocation strategy that Brad has been asked to define.
(S//SI) I also expect $\square$ to capitalize on our partnerships across NSA, the Intel Community, DoD and our foreign partners in pursuit of global geolocation capabilities.
(U//FOUO) I have asked $\square$ to brief SID leadership on the status of this project within 45 days.
(U//FOUO) will be reaching out across SID to accomplish these tasks and I know I can count on each of you to provide him your full support in this critical effort.
