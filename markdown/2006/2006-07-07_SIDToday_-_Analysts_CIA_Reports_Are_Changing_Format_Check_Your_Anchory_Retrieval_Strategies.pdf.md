(U//FOUO) Analysts: CIA Reports Are Changing Format; Check Your Anchory Retrieval Strategies

FROM: Consumer Services (S12C)

Run Date: 07/07/2006
(S) Please note that beginning 13 July 2006, the CIA's National Clandestine Service (NCS, formerly DO) will be changing the format of its intelligence reporting, which may require some NSA/CSS analysts and others to make adjustments to their current retrieval strategies for CIA's TD and TDXs, at a minimum.
(s) Specifically, NCS (DO) will start using National Intelligence Priority Framework codes (e.g TERR for Counterterrorism) in the subject line/titles of their intelligence reports, in place of the prosigns (e.g. CT) currently in use. For your reference, we have included a table below that maps the current two-letter prosigns to the four-letter NIPF codes that will be replacing them.

| Topic <br> Code | Topic Value | Converts to NIPFs: |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| AS | Alien Smuggling | DRUG, CRIM |
| CI | Counterintelligence | CINT |
| CN | Counternarcotics | DRUG, CRIM, MONY |
| CT | Counterterrorism | TERR, HSEC |
| DD | Denial and Deception | FD\&D |
| EC | Export Control | CRIM, TRAD |
| ES | International Economic Issues | ECFS, ESEC, TRAD, FPOL |
| IC | International Organized Crime | CRIM, MONY, DRUG, TRAD |
| IO | Information Operations/Warfare/Assurance | CYBR, TECH |
| ML | Money Laundering | MONY |
| TE | Telecommunications | MCAP, FMCC, INFR |
| WP-AW | Weapons Proliferation-Advanced Conventional <br> Weapons | ACWP |
| WP-BW | Weapons Proliferation-Biological Weapons | WMDB |
| WP-CW | Weapons Proliferation-Chemical Weapons | WMDC |
| WP-DS | Weapons Proliferation-Delivery Systems | WMDM |
| WP-NW | Weapons Proliferation-Nuclear Weapons | WMDN |
| WP-PR | Weapons Proliferation-Procurement | WMDB, WMDC, WMDM, WMDN, <br> ACWP |

Here are some examples of how CIA (DO) report titles will look after the conversion:
SUBJ: WMDM/SPCE : BACKGROUND ON XYZ WEAPONS
SUBJ: TERR: TALIBAN PLAN FOR AMBUSHES
(S) We do not have information at this time whether this change will affect CIA's CIR (Cryptologic Information Report) reporting. While this conversion is scheduled to take effect on 13 July, not all DO reporting will reflect the change at that point, so profiles/queries may need to be adjusted to detect either prosigns or NIPF codes.
