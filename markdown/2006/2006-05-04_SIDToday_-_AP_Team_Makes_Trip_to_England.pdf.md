# (U//FOUO) A\&P Team Makes Trip to England 

FROM: Cindy Farkus
Assistant Deputy Director for Analysis \& Production (S2)
Run Date: 05/04/2006
(U//FOUO) SID group travels to England to meet with GCHQ Analysis \& Production leaders and to visit intelligence sites in Molesworth and Digby.
(U//FOUO) On 1 April - no foolin' - a team from A\&P traveled to GCHQ in Cheltenham, England for the second bi-annual US/UK Analysis \& Production Leadership Forum. The goals of the forum were to formulate joint responses to new requirements and opportunities and review development of joint mission plans.
(U) See the footnote for a list of participants.
(U//FOUO) We arrived in London on 2 April and Bill Squicciarini, who had previously been stationed in England, graciously offered to drive for the week. Not knowing how to "drive on the left" - nor wanting to learn at this time - we accepted his offer. After a long flight, we began our drive west to Cheltenham stopping for refreshment at the Rumblin' Turns caf√© - and free Internet access! We were able to email home our safe arrival and enjoy a hot cup of coffee. After arriving at the Lypiatt House in Cheltenham we had a relaxing afternoon, catching up on our rest and visiting with local friends.

## (U) Cheltenham

(TS) Our session began with lots of coffee as and I discussed our desired outcomes of the session. The group reviewed actions from our last meeting in October '05. We discussed respective mission priorities and planning for 2006-07. We reviewed strategic plans for the future, focusing on Iran and our national requirements and implications for SIGINT production, as well as opportunities for a joint strategy. After a lovely lunch in the GCHQ cafeteria, we discussed TURBULENCE (TU) and MAMBOOKIE and the implications for the SIGINT analysis process and the role of analysis. MAMBOOKIE is GCHQ's coordinated set of technical and business-change activities spanning several projects within Sig Mod/ITIP, which are vital in developing their ability to master the Internet.

We will update each other monthly on TU and MAMBOOKIE. We were briefed by the SMAC (metadata analysis center) and had discussions on Third Party issues and analytic tradecraft.

That evening GCHQ hosted a super dinner at The Swan in Coombe Hill.

(S) The second day of the forum began with a briefing from . Director GCHQ SIGINT Operations Center (GSOC) -- the UK version of NSOC -- and their collaboration efforts with the U.S. The next hour we discussed reporting initiatives to ensure that innovations in GCHQ and NSA are to the benefit of UK and US customers. Following this we discussed CNO and our
respective national strategies and what they mean for A\&P. Finally GCHQ gave us a brief on their lessons learned from their new building so we could benefit from their experience as we buildout in GA, TX, and HI. We wrapped up with a visit by Iain Lobben, Director of Operations for GCHQ where we presented the outcomes actions of the session. A list of actions from this forum will soon be posted to the S2 homepage.

We took advantage of our time in England by adding on visits to JAC Molesworth and RAF Digby. On Tuesday afternoon, Bill Squicciarini drove 00000000 and I to Huntingdon, England stopping at a picture perfect pub, the Beckford Inn for the best fish and chips in England (so they say).
(U//FOUO) During our drive through the English countryside we took a short diversion to Shakespeare's birthplace in Stratford-on-Avon. No time to take a tour - but we managed to shop for gifts! We were happy to get to our hotel, Huntingdon Marriott - wireless Internet and workout facility! After a restful evening, we arrived at the JAC Molesworth to a warm welcome from the site...

# (U) Molesworth 

(U//FOUO) $\square$ , Deputy Chief NCEUR (NSA/CSS Europe) Molesworth hosted our visit and we were also joined by CAPT $\square$ , NCEUR's Chief of Cryptologic Applications, and Lt Col $\square$ Chief, Capabilities and Readiness Branch at the European Security Command (ESC). Also visiting was Major $\square$ from Heidelberg, Germany.
(U//FOUO) We received a very engergetic Joint Analysis Center (JAC) command brief from Mr. JAC Deputy Director of Intelligence, and an introduction to the newly formed IFC (Intelligence Fusion Cell). We toured the Operations Intelligence Center and the Geopspatial Imagery Division. After lunch at the NYPD (deli not police dept!) We held a roundtable discussion with JAC analysts and then further discussions with NCEUR Molesworth leadership. Lastly we met with the JAC Commander $\square$ On behalf of S2 offices, we presented A\&P coins to $\square$ , SSG $\square$ MSgt $\square$ and TSgt $\square$ - for their work in leadership, expertise, and professionalism in all aspects of Analysis and Production.

Major $\square$ briefed us on the current structure at RAF Digby and led us on an ops floor tour, where the subject-matter expert briefed us on current ops. I also had the opportunity to award the S2 coin to some of the outstanding GCHQ and NSA workforce at RAF Digby. They included: $\square$ and $\square$ - for their support to the future Russian mission transfer to the Alaska Mission Operations Center (AMOC). And also, $\square$ and $\square$ for support to S2J in new ways to attempt to solve the Long Range Russian Surface-to-Air Missile Capability issue.
(U//FOUO) After lunch at the officer's mess, $\square$ escorted us to the Sector Operations Room Museum where CT $\square$ took any questions and guided us through the museum. The museum is built inside of a bunker and it is beautifully restored as a tribute to those who served during WW II. U.S. and Canadian forces were also honored in this museum. It was the highlight of our trip.

We wrapped up early for the long drive back to London to catch our flight home the next morning.

## (U) Wrap-Up

(U//FOUO) It was a very busy and productive week. The level and depth of our partnership with GCHQ counterparts is evidenced by the shared concerns, continual support and commitment to keeping each other informed and involved. The critical roles our military and civilian personnel
play in the partner and EUCOM environments were clearly evident everywhere we went. Thanks to those of you serving in those roles and for those of you considering a tour - talk with folks forward - I think you'll get a lot out of what they have to say.
(U) Thanks for listening!
