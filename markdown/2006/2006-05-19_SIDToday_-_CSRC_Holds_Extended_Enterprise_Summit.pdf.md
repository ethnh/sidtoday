(U//FOUO) CSRC Holds Extended Enterprise Summit
FROM: $\square$
Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (S3C)
Run Date: 05/19/2006
(U//FOUO) The first Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) Extended Enterprise Summit was held at NSA/CSS Colorado 21-23 March. The overall theme for the inaugural summit was "Distributed Collection Management."
(U//FOUO) The summit brought together all of the CSRC element leaders and representatives from throughout the Enterprise to work towards implementing governance, division of effort, and vision-casting for the CSRC enterprise. This was the first opportunity for the leadership of all the CSRC Extended Enterprise elements to meet face-to-face and discuss issues without the constraints/limitations of time and distance or the awkwardness of VTC and email.
(U//FOUO) The first part of the conference was dedicated to establishing CSRC's vision and benchmarking Mission Alignment status at each of the Cryptologic Centers. The second part focused on technical discussions with the goal of defining lanes in the road for distributed collection management across the Enterprise.
