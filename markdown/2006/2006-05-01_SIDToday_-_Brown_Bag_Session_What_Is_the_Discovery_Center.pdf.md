(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities. A brief abstract of the planned presentation is below:
(U//FOUO) The Discovery Center is an organization designed to apply innovation and technology to tough target analytic challenges. The innovation applied to these tough challenges can come from anywhere with the results of the discovery applicable across the enterprise. The Discovery Center will help shape innovation and technology developments, through trials and failures, to improve intelligence analysis and the SIGINT process. The niche of the Discovery Center is applying new/different solution sets directly to the intelligence target itself vice the technologies, the collection, the processing, or the reporting. These are more than aptly covered in other organizations and other discovery efforts.
(S//SI) Currently the Center is engaged in two separate areas, nuclear weapons and bioscientists. However, there is room for a few more challenges to coexist in the Discovery Center. We are located at APS20 to allow us to stay focused on the task at hand. We offer an environment that encourages one to just take a step back and give the task some serious review; a luxury most of us do not enjoy.
(U//FOUO) This brown bag session is classified TOP SECRET//COMINT//X1.
