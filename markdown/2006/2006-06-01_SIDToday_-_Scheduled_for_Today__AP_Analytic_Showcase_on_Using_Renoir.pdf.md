TITLE: (U) Using Renoir to Manage Dirty Data, Changing Numbering Plans, and Other Anomalies
Summary:
(U//FOUO) This presentation will illustrate how to use Renoir's "Combine Nodes by Attribute Matching" feature to normalize basic anomalies found in data. Often when data is visualized in a graph, there are instances of duplicate entities because of either missing data, incorrect data, or changing data. The "Combine Nodes by Attribute Matching" feature gives the analyst the capability of removing the duplicity, resulting in a clearer visualization and a more accurate analysis.
(U//FOUO) The Analysis \& Production Analytic Showcase provides a periodic forum for the Analysis and Production Offices to share with the work force both the accomplishments and obstacles impacting the NSA/CSS SIGINT mission. The intent is to focus on timely and current events, ideas, products, successes, systemic issues and obstacles, or collaborative efforts that are shaping, enabling, and impacting the Agency's mission to meet and satisfy our customers' information needs.
(U) For questions regarding the A\&P Showcase, please visit our web page or contact Joe Mercurio S22A, $\square$
