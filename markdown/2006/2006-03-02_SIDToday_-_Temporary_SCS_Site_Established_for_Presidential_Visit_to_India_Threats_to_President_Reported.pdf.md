(TS//SI//REL) President Bush and the First Lady are scheduled to travel to India from 1-4 March, visiting the cities of Hyderabad and New Delhi. The Special Collection Service (SCS) has established a temporary SCS site in Hyderabad to provide Executive Protection during the trip. The site, US-969X169A, will be active from 27 February until 06 March and will use PDDG "JL." (For a full account of SIGINT support to the visit, see HERE .) The presidential party's safety will be of special concern, since SIGINT continues to reflect the possibility of a terrorist attack during the visit:

(TS//SI) The Indian Intelligence Bureau (IB) obtained a letter addressed to Islamic organization in Bangladesh and Pakistan on 24 February which demands the assassination of the U.S. President during his early March visit to India. The letter was obtained by the IB through a "reliable channel" (not further identified).

COMMENT: (TS//SI) The lack of correct punctuation and the fragmented structure of the letter suggests an uneducated author, but is still being taken seriously.
