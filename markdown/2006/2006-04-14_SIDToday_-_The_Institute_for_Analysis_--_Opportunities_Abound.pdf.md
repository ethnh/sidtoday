(U) The Institute for Analysis -- Opportunities Abound

FROM:
Program Manager, Institute for Analysis (IFA) (S211A)
Run Date: 04/14/2006
(U) If you haven't heard about the Institute for Analysis yet, you may be missing out on interesting opportunities that just might challenge your mental mindset and provoke you to think about your analytic challenges in a new light.
(U) The IFA, a collaboration between NSA and the Global Business Network, provides the intelligence analyst with a format and means to acquire new skills and access creative people and novel ideas that enhance their capabilities and renew their professional development. The IFA exposes the intelligence analyst to some of the most creative thinkers in the world, some of the freshest open-source research and the most effective analytical methods being used in the sciences, academia, and business.
(U) The IFA engages in a number of activities that you might find useful:

- Addresses complex analytic challenges in an unclassified environment using open-source data
- Develops and documents alternative approaches to analysis
- Conducts custom training for analysts and leadership
- Introduces people and viewpoints that NSA can't or won't otherwise access
- Publishes a bi-monthly newsletter available on the IFA webpage (Type "Go IFA" in your intranet web browser)
(U) One thing the IFA does for NSA is to address a series of challenges - multi-month analytical projects on questions of concern to NSA using open-source materials. The IFA has completed two of these analytic challenges to date: The Bear and the Dragon which produced seven different scenarios, capturing a range of possible Sino-Russian relationships that could meaningfully impact US national security over the next fifty years, and Illicit Facilitation which explored a new way to locate and understand terrorists, by focusing specifically on the service infrastructure which helps them avoid authorities. Extensive documentation related to both of these challenges is available on the IFA web page.
(U) Two new IFA challenges are now underway. Borders: Across the Great Divide and an unnamed challenge on Latin America. The IFA strives for enterprise-wide participation and is happy to report that the Borders: Across the Great Divide challenge has active participation from sponsors both at NSA/Texas and NSA/Washington.
(U) The IFA-developed seminar on unstructured problems has played to audiences at NSA/Hawaii and NSA/Washington to rave reviews: "Excellent course. It should be taken by as many analysts as possible." "This course was absolutely amazing!" The seminar will be taught at NSA/Georgia in May, NSA/Washington in June and September, and NSA/Colorado in July. Check the NCS catalog at the end of April for exact dates and locations - don't miss this opportunity!
(U) As mentioned above, The IFA publishes a bi-monthly newsletter, which contains updates on IFA projects, book reviews, recommended web sites and an interview with an interesting personality. The current Newsletter, includes an interview with Steve Weber, a political science professor and director of the Institute of International Studies at UC, Berkeley. Steve will be moderating a panel discussion that will be held as part of the annual analysis conference in May (see the related 7 April 2006 SID today Article).
(U) More about the IFA will appear in future articles. To keep up-to-date on activities, I recommend that you bookmark the IFA web page and refer to it from time to time. Remember the IFA newsletter is published bi-monthly, and here's the second edition hot off the press:
