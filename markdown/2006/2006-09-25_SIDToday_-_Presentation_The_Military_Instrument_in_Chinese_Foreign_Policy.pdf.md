# Synopsis: 

(U) During a time of political and military weakness, Beijing relied on military power for ensuring Chinese security in the face of challenges from hostile superpowers and their clients. The reform-era brought with it changes in China's national objectives and foreign policy posture. Beijing now espouses a policy of promoting a peaceful international environment; has integrated itself into the global economy; and involved itself in a host of multilateral institutions. This has resulted in an increase in the costs of using force. Despite the apparent emergence of the PRC as more of a status quo power, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has accelerated its drive toward modernization. The next installment of the China Forum Series will examine the question of what role the Chinese military plays in Beijing's policies and objectives.
