(S//SI) Catch of the Week: Key Arrests in Iraq Illustrate Increasing SIGINT Challenges... and Opportunities

(TS//SI//REL) Three much sought-after insurgents -- a Kurd, a Sunni and a Shi'a -- are captured in a single week.
(S//REL) One week in August 2006 provided a unique perspective on the diversity of threats along the Iraqi front of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). Key captures of three major operators highlight a significant week that preceded the continuing turnover of military components to the Iraqi government, along with an unprecedented level of insurgent violence. The captures showcase our best cryptologic integration efforts and outstanding collaboration within the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community. They also demonstrate the unique challenges of developing and maintaining targets as diverse as those highlighted below...
(TS//SI//REL) On 19 August, U.S. Special Operations Forces successfully apprehended a Kurdish al-Qaida in Iraq (AQIZ) extremist facilitator and explosives expert who produced suicide vests, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and remote control detonation devices. NSA Counterterrorism (CT) and Joint Interagency Task Force - West (JIATF-W) analysts had been tracking through Syria and Iran for over a year, and SIGINT was key in anticipating S movement into Iraq. Once in Iraq, our National Intelligence Support Team (NIST) personnel forward in Balad were key in providing direct support to develop the final target package that prompted the lucrative Special Forces raid. Digital Network Intelligence (DNI) derived from the efforts of new cryptologic talent brought to bear at the Utah Regional Language Center was instrumental in this event.

(TS//SI//REL) On 23 August, a targeted raid east of Fallujah resulted in the apprehension of a Sunni mid-level insurgent leader, IED distributor and weapons trafficker within the militant 1920 Revolutionary Brigade. Reportedly, this was the first significant capture of a 1920 Revolutionary Brigade member. NSA Washington, NSA Georgia and U.S. Marine Corp 2nd Radio Battalion analysts provided target packages, gists and HUMINT reporting in support of the case vs . This information was key to the successful interrogation of the prisoner; in turn that has provided additional target leads under development that will be interdicted in the weeks ahead.

(TS//SI//REL) On 25 August, Shi'a plus three of his operatives were captured as part of a U.S. Army 4th Infantry Division operation. A Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) Commander, had evaded previous targeting operations and his capture required dogged pursuit with multiple raids. JAM considers the capture of a "disaster." NSA Georgia, SCS Baghdad, NCR / CSG Baghdad and the Cryptologic Support Team embedded in the 4th ID were key members of the team responsible for this success.
(S//REL) Each of these captures, individually, represents huge victories in the GWOT. Collectively, they represent a diverse group... whether viewed organizationally, by religious affiliation, or by method of capture. They also represent the breadth and depth of cryptologic capabilities and the full range of Operation Iraqi Freedom customers supported by SIGINT. We certainly have great reason to be proud of and celebrate these critical successes in the GWOT. We will also remain vigilant and aggressive in pursuit of new and existing targets in this crucial time.
(U//FOUO) The following is from the Deputy Director's WARGram-71, 13 May 2005...
(U//FOUO) "The days and weeks following key terrorist captures often provide reflections and interrogation information that lead to insight into future terrorist operations. I charge the entire cryptologic workforce to think as creatively and aggressively as possible in the continued pursuit of these important mission areas. I am extremely proud of the men and women of NSA/CSS and greatly appreciate your outstanding contributions."
