# (S//REL) TechSIGINT Watch Desks Renamed 

FROM: multiple authors at NSA/CSS Colorado Unknown
Run Date: 08/04/2006
(S//REL) Watch desks in NSOC and Denver now share the TSSC name.
(S//REL) In April 2006, SID today announced the stand up of a new NSOC desk, the TechSIGINT Senior Coordinator (TSSC) (see that article ). At that time, the TSSC desk joined the already existing NSA/CSS Colorado TechSIGINT Operations Support (CTOPS) watch desk to form a joint team that executes the multi-disciplined TechSIGINT mission:

- PROFORMA,
- Foreign Instrument Signals Intelligence (FISINT),
- Specific Emitter Identification (SEI),
- ELINT (technical and operational- maritime, land and air) and
- RF Communications Externals (COMEXT). Primary goals for this joint watch team include:
- Improved synchronization of the Global TechSIGINT Enterprise (GTSE),
- Better connections between NSA Colorado (NSAC) and NSOC,
- Immediate and focused TechSIGINT customer support, and
- Built-in continuity of operations.
(S//REL) In recognition that CTOPS and TSSC are in fact a single team -- two sides of the same coin -- effective 30 June 2006, the desks respectively have been renamed TSSC-Colorado and TSSC-NSOC.
(S//REL) While some duties are interchangeable...
- TSSC-Colorado tends to focus on operational support to military customers and has the additional duty of representing NSA Colorado (NSAC) 24/7;
- TSSC-NSOC tends to support our national customers, is NSAC's TechSIGINT representative in NSOC and serves as NSOC's liaison to the Defense Special Missile and Aerospace Center (DEFSMAC).
