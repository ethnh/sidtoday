# (U) Mandatory NO FEAR Training 

FROM: Fran Fleisch
SID Chief of Staff
Run Date: 12/08/2006
(U) On behalf of the entire SID management team, I encourage each of you to become informed of your rights, responsibilities and remedies under the federal antidiscrimination NO FEAR laws. The Office of Personnel Management recently issued a regulation requiring that all federal employees receive training on NO FEAR laws by 17 December 2006, and every two years thereafter. This applies to all NSA civilians and military personnel who supervise civilians. The Agency-all message of 9 November* from the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity describes how you can receive this training in a variety of ways -- via briefings (either in person or via VTC), on Newsmagazine, or on your own computer via streaming video.
(U) If you haven't already done so, please take some time over the next week to complete this important training. Thank you!
