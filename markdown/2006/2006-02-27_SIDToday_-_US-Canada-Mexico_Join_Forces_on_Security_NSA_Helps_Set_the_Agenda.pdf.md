(U) Last year, the US, Canada and Mexico agreed to work together to improve their common security -- and now the intelligence and law enforcement communities, led by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), are helping lay the groundwork for this international collaboration.
(U) The agreement, announced by President Bush, Prime Minister Martin of Canada and President Fox of Mexico in June 05, is known as the President's Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) initiative. The idea is to establish a common approach to security to protect North America from threats both external and internal. At the same time, the SPP aims to make security measures, such as at borders, as "painless" as possible for law-abiding citizens.
(U) The agreement states that the three countries will:

- better protect critical infrastructure and implement a common approach to emergency response;
- bring about improvements in aviation and maritime security, combat transnational threats, and enhance intelligence partnerships; and
- implement common border security while improving the flow of people and cargo at shared borders.
(U//FOUO) So, what progress has been made to date? In January 2006, the first US interagency working group, led by DHS, met to lay the groundwork for a joint bi-national (US and Canadian) review of the terrorist threat to North America. The first step is for the US and Canada to work together more closely on intelligence related to North American security, particularly focusing on sharing the terrorism watch list, ensuring appropriate connectivity and communication between the two countries, and enhancing analytical cooperation.
(U//FOUO) NSA proposed, and the Intelligence Community agreed, that we need a common understanding of what the threats are, where disconnects are, and what the vulnerabilities are, when discussing "threats to North America." Additionally, there was agreement that both intelligence and homeland security are bigger than counter-terrorism alone, and that illicit facilitation, smuggling, and other issues should also be included. Finally, it was determined that we need to get common definitions between the US and Canada on such terms as "terrorism" so that both parties are talking about the same issues.
(U//FOUO) The Intelligence Community is currently preparing a document to share with the Canadians on joint cross-border projects, as well as definitions for commonly used terms. The first bilateral meeting will be held in March 2006. A similar working group will eventually be formed to work border issues with the Mexicans.
