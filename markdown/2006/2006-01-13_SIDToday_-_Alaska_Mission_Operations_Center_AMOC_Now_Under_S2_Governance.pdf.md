(U//FOUO) Alaska Mission Operations Center (AMOC) Now Under S2 Governance

(U//FOUO) The AMOC now falls under the authority of SID's Analysis and Production (S2) rather than Data Acquisition (S3).
(U//FOUO) In December 2005 the SIGINT Director signed off on a proposal to transfer the Alaska Mission Operations Center (AMOC) from S3 to S2 governance. AMOC had been under S3 governance since April 2004 (when SID developed its governance models under NSA/CSS Policy 1-3), having been assessed as primarily a collection site.
(S//SI) Over the last year, S2 and S3 leadership recognized that the site would probably be more appropriately aligned with S2. There were some contributing factors indicating that the Center had an analysis and production focus, with collection as a supporting activity:

- The Russian Air Analysis \& Reporting (A\&R) mission is planned to transfer from NSA/CSS Texas to AMOC as part of mission alignment;
- Similarly, the Russian Strategic Air A\&R mission is planned to transfer from RAF Digby to AMOC;
- There was increased recognition that AMOC uses not only on-site but worldwide collection resources to carry out its A\&R mission, much like the Cryptologic Centers; and
- A skills accounting revealed that a majority of the personnel at site are analyst/reporters rather than collectors.
(S//SI) Under the new S2 governance of AMOC, the commander is a member of the Analysis and Production Senior Leadership Team (SLT), which meets weekly with the Enterprise via VTC. The AMOC will also become a Production Center for Russian Air Defense, and could later be considered for future missions as well. S3 will continue to work with the site and S2 on requirements to support the Russian Air mission transfer, as well as accepting requirements for collection and processing services from AMOC, which will be considered and filled in line with S3 worldwide priorities.
