# (U//FOUO) Mandatory Language Training 

FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 04/25/2006
(U//FOUO) New two-year training cycle of 160 hours mandated for all language analysts.
(U//FOUO) In March 2004, I mandated that every civilian and military language analyst in the SIGINT System complete 160 hours of language training by March 2006. This period has now expired, so it is time to evaluate the success of this mandate and to decide the course of action for ensuring continued focus remains on this critical aspect of our cryptologic language readiness.
(U//FOUO) As a result of the initial two-year training cycle, $45 \%$ of the language analysts assigned to NSAW and approximately $40 \%$ worldwide completed at least 160 hours of language training. More importantly, at least $75 \%$ of all language analysts completed some language training.... in large part because language analysts and supervisors realized such training was needed for us to fulfill our critical missions. We can and must do much better, however; increased attention is needed to ensure we keep up this momentum.
(U//FOUO) There are many initiatives in place to underpin this training, including additional billets for training backfill, sizable increases in language training funding, and innovative initiatives by ADET 's Center for Language and other partners to meet everyone's training needs. None, however, will work without a strong operationally focused standard for all working language analysts.
(U//FOUO) Therefore, I have directed that our policy, in the form of SID Directive 413 (" Significant Cryptologic Language Training Events "), be revised to document another two-year training cycle of at least 160 hours of language training for all language analysts, effective 1 May 06 and running until 1 May 08 , with semi-annual reporting to S2 and SID on progress toward completion of the goal. This communiqu√© will be used as interim guidance until the SID Directive is revised.
(U//FOUO) Every hour of language training completed is vital to our national security interests. For language analysts working in operations, we cannot predict what mission we will ask you to take on tomorrow, so you need to be prepared. For supervisors, your efforts to ensure language analysts improve their skills may not seem to be an immediate gain -- as others must backfill their efforts while in training (or their queues back up) -- but I fully support time away from operations for language analysts to improve their language abilities, and so should you.
(U//FOUO) Establishing another two-year training cycle, with measurements to ensure our pace is steady and all can complete their training within that time period, will help us meet this critical mission need.
