(U) Are you new here? New to the Agency or to the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID)? If you are, would it help if you knew more of what was going on in SID? Of course it would! It is for that reason SID offers the SID Orientation ten times each year.
(U//FOUO) During the two-day class, recently hired or assigned personnel are exposed to the many facets of SID. Besides overview briefings detailing the mission of each Deputy Directorate (S1, S2, and S3), attendees will hear mission-related success stories, which at times tell the story behind the news headlines. Learn about some of the opportunities that SID offers its employees, too.
(U//FOUO) If you would like more information or would like to register for any future offerings, visit the SID Orientation website or contact www.sid.org (s), (u) (v) (w)
