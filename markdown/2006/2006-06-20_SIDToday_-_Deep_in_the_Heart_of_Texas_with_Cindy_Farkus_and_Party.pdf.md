(U) Deep in the Heart of Texas with Cindy Farkus and 'Party'

FROM: Cindy Farkus
Assistant Deputy Director for Analysis \& Production (S2)
Run Date: 06/20/2006
(U//FOUO) On 23-25 May I had the opportunity to visit NSA/CSS Texas in San Antonio. Traveling with me was my Executive Assistant, (i.e. "party").
(U//FOUO) I spent four years at "MRSOC"* in the late nineties, so I definitely feel a sense of pride when I see how far the MRSOC has come in its transformation into a Cryptologic Center (CC). And, I was certainly reminded on our first afternoon just how warm it can get in San Antonio in May! (It got up to about 96 degrees F.)
(U//FOUO) We were welcomed by $\square$, Texas S2 Chief of Staff and , NSA/CSS TX protocol officer. Seeing (and her smile) made me feel as though I were coming home! MAJ $\square$ Deputy Director of Texas Security Operations Center (TSOC their extension of NSOC) gave us an executive overview and update of all the changes at Texas. During our courtesy call, Col Jim Marrs, Commander of NSA/CSS TX, teed up issues to discuss over lunch. Topics included:

- the Strategic Future Mission List and how we respond as an enterprise, to include the best use of the $10 \%$ of resources left to the discretion of each mission manager,
- the GCM (Global Capabilities Manager) role in mission governance, and
- the strategic theme for NSA/CSS TX.
(U//FOUO) I met with the SID Leadership, Col Rick Marcinowski (TX SID), Bill Edinger (TX D/SID), (TX Homeland Security Director), and (TX SID Chief of Staff) to discuss the latest information on Transformation 3.0, the on-going budget planning cycle and potential implications for NSA/CSS Texas. They share the same concerns and face the same challenges as we do.
(U//FOUO) I spent some time with , Acting NSA/CSS TX S2 and newly designated Assistant Intelligence Authority (AIA) for Texas. Topics included current S2 missions and personnel assignments, the hiring program, the IADP* and opportunities for professional development of his current analytic workforce. will take the knowledge he's gained throughout this military and civilian career, and in particular what he has learned in his time in Texas, to establish the AIA/TX structure. While the acronym AIA means something else to many in San Antonio -- Air Intelligence Agency -- I am confident will make his mark with an additional meaning for AIA.
(U//FOUO) Texas took me up on my offer to hold a town meeting with the SID workforce. You never quite know how these sessions will go or where the questions will take you; however, I always learn something. This time was no exception. Questions focused on:
- Homeland Security/Defense and the role for NSA HQ and NSA/CSS Texas;
- the meaning of governance for an S2 site;
- Human Resources processes and how it effects the enterprise with regard to assignments and home basing;
- the hiring situation, budget/resource impacts of Transformation 3.0, what it means to plans already in progress and what it means to the enterprise, mission build-out and to Texas in particular.

We have several initiatives under way to address these and other items of interest to all of us and we'll be getting details out on them in the near future.
(U//FOUO) That evening, a social at Mi Tierra Restaurant and Bakery gave us a flavor of Texas hospitality and delicious Tex/Mex cuisine! It offered me a chance to catch up with folks I've known for a long time as well as to make new friends.

(U//FOUO) Our second day began with an S2 Leadership roundtable discussion. Topics included:

- Budget - current and future - what it will be at Headquarters and what it will be on site;
- build-out preparation, including fit up and training funds;
- the definition of metadata;
- what it means to be part of "Big A - little P";
- ongoing challenges in developing the governance structure, and progress that has been made;
- the possibility of a GCM at Texas in the future; and
- an idea for an advocate for the CCs at HQ.

We'll be following up on these and will keep you informed as things progress.
(U//FOUO) Col Jim Marrs, NSA/CSS TX Commander, invited me to attend his prep session for the HIGHCASTLE deployment acceptance "outbrief." (For more info on HIGHCASTLE type " go highcastle " in your browser). Texas wanted to address some requirements, potential mission impact and the way ahead. The team worked with site personnel and resolved many of the items. You'll be hearing more from the HIGHCASTLE team soon.
(U//FOUO) I met with $\square$, Chief of TX SIGDEV and $\square$, TX ADET* in particular to ensure we are in sync and linked on key areas being worked at Headquarters. was concerned about metadata and determining priorities for mission in such a way that all are aware. and I focused on how we bring the right training throughout the enterprise to A\&P military and civilian personnel, at all career levels.
(U//FOUO) , new TX SID Technical Director, had only arrived in town a few weeks ago. We discussed the challenges ahead as we determine what Transformation 3.0 means to A\&P and the broader SID workforce.
(U//FOUO) The best part of the visit is where I get to recognize outstanding work being done by folks in TX. These individuals, selected by the Group Chiefs, Global Capabilities Managers, Primary Production Center Managers, and the MARSOC PMO* are making their mark in TX. Personnel from across their SID and Information Technology organizations were recognized. Accomplishments covered mission transfers from TX to AMOC* and MOC*, operational and training successes and systems development and installation. They can be very proud of the work they and their teams are performing. Those receiving coins included:

(U//FOUO) No trip to San Antonio is complete without fresh-made tortillas. We managed to stop by "Alamo Caf√©" on the way to the airport, and I know I made some people very happy with my 4-dozen tortillas!
(U//FOUO) When in San Antonio you can't help but think of history - Spanish missions are located throughout the city. Our hotel was situated right next to the Alamo...

San Antonio and the Alamo played a critical role in the Texas Revolution. We're confident that NSA/CSS TX will play as critical a role in the mission build-out "revolution" and how we adapt and change to meet the challenges of the future.

Hasta luego!
Cindy
