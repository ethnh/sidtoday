(U) CPE Delayed, But Improved

(U//FOUO) New tool for authoring reports to be launched later this year.
(U//FOUO) The Content Preparation Environment (CPE) is now scheduled to begin to replace SIGINT On Demand (SOD) over a 7week period later this year. The rollout of CPE marks the beginning of NSA's transition from SOD and legacy authoring systems to CPE as the next step along the Dissemination Modernization (DM) path. When the rollout to CPE is complete, SOD will be decommissioned.

## (U) Background

(U//FOUO) Plans originally called for a June rollout of CPE 1.0 (see earlier article ), which was to be followed by a second increment (1.1) in the fall. However, user testing revealed a need for additional refinements before release. The subsequent delay has been the result of a vigorous effort to refine CPE as quickly as possible while still adhering to our overriding goal of providing the best possible foundational capabilities to analysts and reporters: quality will not be sacrificed for expediency.

## (U) Combined and Improved

(U) Because of these developments, it was decided to combine the first two increments ( 1.0 and 1.1) into a single version instead of releasing separate ones back-to-back. Consequently, the premier CPE release will actually provide more capabilities than originally planned. Besides including 1.0's original features (web-based, replacing SOD and all SOD Special Editions, and able to produce GAMMA, ORCON, and NOFORN reports) and displaying enhanced performance, this new version will add several features:

- Spell checker
- "Copy report"
- Find/replace
(U//FOUO) Once the additional features have been added and tested, the upgraded version should be ready for release to users in the sequence originally listed in the rollout schedule, updated 31 August 2006.


## (U) Upcoming

(U) Further details on CPE will be forthcoming on a regular basis via CPE communiqu√©s between now and its rollout. For more information on CPE, please visit the CPE website ("go cpe").
