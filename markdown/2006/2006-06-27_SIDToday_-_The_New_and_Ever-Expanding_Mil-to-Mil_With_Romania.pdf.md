(S//REL) The New and Ever-Expanding Mil-to-Mil With Romania
FROM:
FAD's Coalition, Multilateral and Military Affairs Office (DP14)
Run Date: 06/27/2006
(S//REL) US-Romanian military-to-military relationship established; targets of mutual interest include terrorism and Eastern Europe.
(S//REL) Romania is a country that will have more visibility on this Administration's radar for the next couple years. Currently the Romanians are very active participants in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). Romania is partnering with the US military in coalition operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, with tactical SIGINT elements in both places. The Romanians currently have a SIGINT team deployed in Babil, Iraq, providing timely and relevant intelligence to both the local Romanian commander and the CJTF-7* commander. In Afghanistan, the Romanians are moving into the Zabul province and will have a US infantry company under their command.
(S//REL) In addition to their participation in the GWOT, the Romanians have much to offer USEUCOM (the US European Command). They are filling US billets in Kosovo for USEUCOM, and USEUCOM is establishing the Eastern European Task Force (EETAF) in Romania as part of the EUCOM Theater Security Plan. The EETAF is a Brigade-sized split element headquartered at Mihail Kogalniceanu (MK) Air Base with a battalion-size maneuver element rotating into Romania on a semi-annual basis to conduct training. In addition to the above initiatives, the Romanians have access to the Black Sea and are very interested in partnering with NSA.
(S//SI) NSA is not currently interested in a national relationship with Romania, although FAD* has accompanied the US Army's 66th Military Intelligence Group (based in Darmstadt, Germany) to Romania on TDY for exploratory discussions with the Romanian Military Intelligence Directorate (MID). The 66th MI Group made its original fact-finding trip to Romania in 2004. After this initial trip, the 66th MI Group decided that they were very interested in a military-tomilitary SIGINT relationship with the Romanian MID. The 66th MI Group vetted their request through USAREUR (US Army Europe) and USEUCOM, and DP14* prepared a package for the SIGINT Committee and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI).
(S//SI) The DNI approved a military-to- military SIGINT relationship between the 66th MI Group and the Romanian Military Intelligence Directorate (MID) on 3 Feb 2006. The two parties are authorized to exchange SIGINT information on targets of mutual interest, including terrorism (force protection-related), Ukraine, Moldova, Russia, Trans-Caucasus AO*, Black Sea AO, Serbia \& Montenegro. This approval came at a critical time for USCENTCOM (US Central Command) because, as mentioned above, US troops will soon be under Romanian command in Afghanistan. FAD is already working to expand the approved target set of this relationship, even though it is in the very early stages.
