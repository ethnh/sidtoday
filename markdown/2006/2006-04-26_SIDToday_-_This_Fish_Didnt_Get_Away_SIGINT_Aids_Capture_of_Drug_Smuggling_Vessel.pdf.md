(S//SI) Joint US/UK collection system reveals the location of a vessel carrying a huge quantity of drugs.
(S//SI) SIGINT recently played a major role in the capture of a smuggling vessel in the Caribbean that was carrying 211 bales of cocaine weighing 95 pounds each -- a total of 9.03 metric tons!
(S//SI) The key SIGINT was intercepted with GLAIVE, a joint US-UK HF/VHF/UHF collection system. Specifically, a GLAIVE remote-collection system located at a Royal Dutch Navy facility on the island of Curacao intercepted transmissions from the drug-smuggling vessel Barracuda. Operators within the Naval Intelligence Operation Center at NSA/CSS Texas correlated the Barracuda intercepts with associated references of law enforcement presence to determine the location of the vessel, and to develop the overall tactical/situational picture.
(U//FOUO) On the evening of 24 February, the Barracuda was boarded and seized by the Navy cruiser USS Gettysburg. The crew was apprehended and the Barracuda was subsequently sunk.

(S//SI) Project SUNBEAVER deployed GLAIVE to Curacao in May of last year. SUNBEAVER was a coordinated effort between 15 different organizations, to target Colombian narcotics trafficking. This is just one of many instances where SUNBEAVER is making a difference in narcotics interdiction.
