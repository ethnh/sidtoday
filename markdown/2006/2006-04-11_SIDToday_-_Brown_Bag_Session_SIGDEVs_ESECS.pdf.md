(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce another brown bag discussion focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest. We believe these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT Development, or who are interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT Development activities. A brief abstract of the planned presentation is below:
(C) Do you collaborate with analysts across the Cryptologic Enterprise? Have you found that phone calls and emails aren't enough to capture your analytic results? If so, using SIGDEV's ESECS (The SIGDEV Extended SIGINT Enterprise Corporate Server) may be your solution.
(C) ESECS enables analysts to efficiently manage their resources across the extended SIGINT enterprise so that common tools, information, and work results were available to all of its analysts. ESECS provides a web-portal based, collaborative, customizable application offering virtual workspaces to network analysts and mission managers.
(S) ESECS:

- is readily available to forward-deployed users with limited IT support;
- houses the SIGDEV requirements tracking process with customized workflow;
- includes the ability to email content and attachments directly into the system, either programmatically or manually;
- utilizes a robust search engine and the ability to save searches and run search agents which notify users automatically with search results;
- is rapidly making progress toward 2nd party accessibility.
