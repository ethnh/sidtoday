(U//FOUO) Goodbye SEIB, Hello WIRe
FROM: Geoff Fowler
WIRe Managing Editor (CIA)
Run Date: 07/31/2006
(U//FOUO) The CIA's daily corporate intelligence publication has a new name and a new look... (Note: Patrick Bomgardner, Chief, Executive Support Staff (S17), helped produce this article.)
(U//FOUO) CIA retired the Senior Executive Intelligence Brief (SEIB) on Saturday, 29 July, and in its place today launched the World Intelligence Review (WIRe) as its daily (except Sundays) premiere corporate intelligence publication. The WIRe adopts format and business process changes that allow the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence (DI) to better provide "Intelligence with Currency" to its customers and to avoid the risks of homogenized intelligence identified in the WMD Commission Report. Additional details on the WIRe will be forthcoming in its inaugural edition, which will be made available to all current SEIB recipients.
(U//FOUO) The WIRe Managing Editor answers some Frequently Asked Questions about this new publication:
(U//FOUO) Who is the audience for the WIRe? The printed edition of the WIRe is targeted at national level customers at the Cabinet and sub-Cabinet (Under and Assistant Secretary) level. Initial distribution of the WIRe will be to current SEIB recipients.
(U//FOUO) How does the WIRe differ from the SEIB? The WIRe will present "Intelligence with Currency" -- of current value to the reader -- whether it was created just for that day's publication or as part of the DI's research effort. This approach will allow the DI to leverage the full range of its content to the benefit of customers in a manner that also permits greater emphasis on the development of thoughtful analysis. To avoid the failings of homogenized intelligence identified in the WMD Commission Report, WIRe items will not be formally coordinated across the Intelligence Community (IC), but will present thoughtful analytical counterpoints both from within and outside CIA.
(U//FOUO) Why not just change the contents and process within the existing SEIB? Customers may have noticed that CIA, over the course of the past six months, experimented with changing the content and form of items conveyed within the SEIB, to include publication of Red Cells, foldout graphics, and a variety of in-depth special analyses. CIA concluded as a result of this effort that additional business process changes were required to successfully adopt its vision of "Intelligence with Currency" and to eliminate homogenized intelligence through adoption of the Thesis-Antithesis model. Taken together, the change to content and business process reflected a significant departure from the SEIB; thus CIA decided to retire the SEIB and launch the WIRe to make clear the differing aspects of the publication.
(U//FOUO) What does the WIRe mean for DI analysts as far as coordination with other IC Agencies? Unlike the SEIB, the WIRe is intended to convey the DI's analytic view on a given substantive issue. As such, submissions to the WIRe do not require community coordination for substance. Most often, we expect that WIRe items will reflect the corporate view of the DI and be coordinated for substance across appropriate offices, however the WIRe will on a case-bycase basis accept content that reflects an uncoordinated view from within the DI as a form of special analysis--an Analytic Opinion. In the event an Office or author wants to offer an internally uncoordinated item, the authoring entity must explain why the item has not been coordinated internally and if there are any known differing analytic views within the DI. In the event an uncoordinated item is selected for publication, the WIRe Managing Editor will allow alternative views to be conveyed either through a companion item or in a "Letters to the Editor" column.
(U//FOUO) What role will other IC elements have relative to the WIRe? Consistent with normal clearance practices, when ORCON material is used in analytic items scheduled for conveyance through the WIRe, CIA analysts will seek originating agency clearance for use of the particular content. If other IC analytic elements have a differing analytic conclusion or view, the organization may submit a corporate response to the WIRe Managing Editor who will make a determination as to whether the feedback is included in a Letters to the Editor section of the WIRe or possibly as an alternative analytic piece.
(U//FOUO) How will alternative views be conveyed in the WIRe? In the printed edition of the WIRe alternative views submitted to and selected by the WIRe Managing Editor will be presented in either a "Letters to the Editor" column or, if the issues warrant, as a separate analytical content items. When the WIRe online is deployed, customers may be presented a "link" that takes them to alternative analytic views.
(U//FOUO) What do you mean by the Thesis-Antithesis Editorial Model? The WIRe will represent the analytic "thesis" of the DI or a given element or individual within the DI. Alternative views (the antithesis) will be presented either as companion analytic items or conveyed via a "Letters to the Editor" column. This approach was adopted in response to WMD Commission warnings against the production of homogenized intelligence and the recognition that past coordination models associated with the SEIB tended to produce lowest common denominator analysis, rather than effectively highlighting analytical differences.
(U//FOUO) How will other Agencies provide their "antithesis" views? Each element of the IC will need to identify their own process for submitting corporately coordinated alternative analytical views to WIRe items. Those views, questions, and comments may be submitted to the WIRe Managing Editor. [Note from Patrick Bomgardner, Chief, Executive Support Staff: While details are still being worked out, we plan that NSA WIRe submissions will be made through the S17 Executive Support Staff using a process similar to that used for the submission of President's Daily Briefing items.]
(U//FOUO) What is the "WIRe online"? While the initial launch of the WIRe is in hardcopy, CIA is devoted to providing a robust online interface that allows more comprehensive conveyance of our WIRe analytic content. The DI has made great strides developing a dynamic on-line vehicle patterned after the best of online web-content sites. This JWICs/Intelink-based service uses advancements in technology to present analytic content dynamically and opens a world of opportunities for creation and conveyance of analytical insights. CIA has targeted deployment to customers in early FY07, however the pilot system is already deployed internally in CIA.
(U//FOUO) What are the look-and-feel differences? The hallmark of the WIRe will be flexibility of presentation and quality and depth of content. CIA has during the past six months been testing many WIRe elements in the exiting SEIB, to include longer richer special analyses, foldout graphics, and other variations in form. The WIRe will have a new layout, with room for short "World-in-Brief" items, longer "Articles," and "Special Analyses" that may take various forms and include in-depth research, red cell and alternative views, or even graphics-only stories. Each item will also carry with it the byline of the authoring office and office contact information is printed on the inside cover of the WIRe. The WIRe will not contain organization "slugs" at the end of item as was common in the SEIB.
(U//FOUO) Are the handling restrictions for the WIRe different than the SEIB? Yes. Unlike the SEIB, customers will be permitted to retain WIRe items provided that they are handled and stored in accordance with their classification and are disposed of in accordance with the host agency records control schedule. To facilitate this, individual items in the WIRe will carry the classification of the given article vice the overall classification of the composite publication.
(U//FOUO) What will happen to the various derivative documents of the SEIB? Until the WIRe online is made available to customers, SEIB derivatives such as the World Wide NID on JWICs, the World Brief on SIPRNet, and various DIFNET and other derivatives will continue. WIRe items will also be submitted to CIA Source. The contents of these items will be derived from the WIRe in the same manner as they had been derived from the SEIB.
(U//FOUO) How have other IC partners reacted to the WIRe? CIA has informed the Director CIA, our community partners, and the ODNI about our plans and has received uniformly
positive and supportive feedback.
