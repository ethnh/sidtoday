(U//FOUO) Update on the Cryptologic Access Skill Field
FROM:
Chief, Enterprise Management (S3C11)
Run Date: 12/19/2006
(U//FOUO) While it has been some time since our last SID today article*, the Cryptologic Access (CAX) revitalization team has been making great progress in developing the training offerings and career development opportunities that meet the needs of the skill community. The CAX Senior Steering Group was recently established, made up of senior leaders representing the organizations that are the key stakeholders in NSA's collection function. Earlier this year, the Center for Cryptology (E9) committed funds and began updating the Collection Management courses. These are great first steps toward our goal of improving CAX support to the SIGINT mission via a career-spanning development program.
(U//FOUO) The purpose of the CAX skill community is to actively integrate analytic skills and knowledge into the collection function. A stronger understanding of the Global Information Environment (digital and analog) in the collection work force will strengthen the new access development side of SIGDEV. Keeping pace with a rapidly changing technological front is an essential element of the cryptologic access function.
(U//FOUO) The primary offerings of the CAX skill community are:

1. The CAX internship, which will offer participants a structured three-year development program,
2. A recognized career path that provides growth, advancement, and flexibility in career opportunities, and
3. Professional development with relevant and current training.
(U//FOUO) The Access Analyst and Access Manager Training Needs Assessments (TNAs) are complete and are providing the necessary prioritization for courses that require the most immediate attention. The Data Flow and Targeting \& Compliance Manager TNAs are also nearing completion.
(U//FOUO) Since early October, representatives from the CAX revitalization team have participated in the development of the Collection Competencies Model, ensuring that efforts at NSA are properly aligned with the direction of the ODNI framework.
(U//FOUO) Another recent development is the incorporation of the military functions into the CAX skill community. Recently ADET issued ExecMessage-149, where they introduced the Professional Development Council and discussed strategic plans surrounding this activity. CAX is working with the military Functional Managers to ensure the appropriate arrangement between the various functional areas that fall under the CAX umbrella. Our objective is to provide the same educational and career development opportunities to both civilian and military, resulting in a fully integrated workforce that keeps pace with a rapidly changing target communications environment.
