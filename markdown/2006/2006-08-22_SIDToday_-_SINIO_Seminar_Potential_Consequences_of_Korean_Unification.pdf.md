(S) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present the 15th in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for the summer of 2006. " East Asia 10 Years After Korean Reconciliation/Normalization/Unification - 'A Journey into the Possible' " will be presented by Mr. Tim Miner, SINIO for East Asia.

# Course Overview: 

(U) Be careful what you wish for!
(U//FOUO) The politically fractured Korean peninsula, and more specifically the bellicose North Korean regime, has destabilized the region and frustrated U.S. and allied foreign and security policies for decades. However, a unified Korean peninsula could create circumstances that would challenge regional and global security interests in novel, potentially dangerous ways. Come join the East Asia SINIOs for this discussion of some of the downstream effects -- intended and otherwise -- of Korean reconciliation/unification in multiple dimensions, to include economics, regional stability, and global security.
(U//FOUO) To register, and for further info on this series of seminars, please consult the SINIO Brown Bag Seminars Website. Any questions or concerns regarding registration should be directed to the NCS.
