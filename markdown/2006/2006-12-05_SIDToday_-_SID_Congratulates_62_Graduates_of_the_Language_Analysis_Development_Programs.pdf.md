(U//FOUO) SID Congratulates 62 Graduates of the Language Analysis Development Programs

Senior Language Advisor's Chief of Staff (S2)

(U//FOUO) Sixty-two participants in the Language Analysis New Hire Development Program (LDP), the Language Enhancement Program (LEP), the Senior Language Development Program (SLDP) and the Language Analysis Cross-Training Program received graduation certificates on November 17th in the Friedman Auditorium.
(U//FOUO) The 40 LDP graduates all attained high proficiency and performance capabilities in languages from Arabic to Turkish. They also served in offices throughout the SIGINT Directorate, at the National Cryptologic School, in the Research Directorate, at other government agencies, and on temporary duty assignments across the Global Enterprise. In addition to being outstanding language analysts, they excelled as team leaders, mentors, researchers, advisors, and teachers.
(U//FOUO) Twenty LEP graduates were recognized at the ceremony in the Friedman. The LEP*, launched in 2004, is an intensive global language training program which takes new hires with skills in commonly taught languages (such as French) and cross-trains them in a critically needed, less-commonly-taught language (like Arabic). The LEP also enables personnel who already have some knowledge of a critically needed language to enhance their skills to a very high level. Depending on the language and the skill level of the participant, the program could take up to three years to complete. LEP participants graduate into an abbreviated version of the LDP.
(U//FOUO) One SLDP participant graduated and returned to the workforce with enhanced skills. The SLDP was inspired by and modeled after the very successful LDP. The program encourages senior language analysts to work on less developed skills such as voice analysis and to work in new areas like SIGINT Development. The goals of the program are accomplished through various training and mission-rotation activities such as upper level NCS language courses, incountry immersion, and different mission rotations.
(U//FOUO) One Language Cross-Training Program member participated in the graduation ceremony. Cross-Training Program participants learn a new language to help with the Agency's critical language requirements. They bring a wealth of SIGINT experience to the program.
