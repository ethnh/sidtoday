(U) The Diversity Climate Study has been posted on the SID Diversity Webpage. The study was conducted last December by ProGroup, a leading diversity management and consulting firm. It was the first step in assessing our needs and preparing a strategy in response to MG Quirk's goal of acquiring world-class diversity training for our organization. The findings drawn from the input of SID's workforce and leadership can be found at " go sid-diversity ." We invite you to review the results and then comment via the SID Diversity Mailbag.
