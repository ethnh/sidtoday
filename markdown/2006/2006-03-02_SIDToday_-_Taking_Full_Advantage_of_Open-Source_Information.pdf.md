(U//FOUO) Taking Full Advantage of Open-Source Information
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA Signals Intelligence Director Run Date: 03/02/2006
(U//FOUO) An Agency team is looking into ways to better exploit open-source info (i.e. info that's openly available, such as press reports, material posted on the Internet, etc.).
(U//FOUO) On 1 November 2005, Ambassador Negroponte, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), established the Open-Source Center. (See the DNI message .) It is the centerpiece of his response to the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission's recommendations calling for the Intelligence Community to devote more attention and resources to exploiting openly available information.
(U//FOUO) NSA, too, must address this issue. Many of our adversaries plan, operate, and communicate in the world of open-source information and media - and to be effective, we must operate in this same "battle space" as our enemies.
(S//REL) Each of NSA's core missions (SIGINT, Netwarfare, and Information Assurance) require significant use of open-source information. Open-source information plays a key role in enriching analysis, owning the Net, leveraging technology trends, assisting access, and performing target development.
(U//FOUO) To jump-start the open-source effort, I have asked a process team to examine this issue. This team will have participation from many places in the Enterprise in order to scope open-source issues to a degree not previously documented -- including a thorough legal and policy review. The team will also provide a recommendation for a suitable structure to implement changes needed to fully exploit this information.
(U//FOUO) The importance of open source to our missions is critical and timely; therefore, be prepared, if asked, to describe your role in the acquisition, use or processing of opensource information. I have requested that the team report back to SID leadership in 30 days and recommend a way ahead.
(U//FOUO) If you have questions, please send your email to the DL S_Opensource alias.
