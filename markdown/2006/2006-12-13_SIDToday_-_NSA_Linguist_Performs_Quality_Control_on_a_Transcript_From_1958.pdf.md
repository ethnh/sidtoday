(C) As part of a response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the Office of Policy \& Records Staff recently received unusual linguistic support from $\square$ a member of the Special Language Support branch in the Office of Russia. In 1958, a USAF C-130A reconnaissance aircraft went astray and was tragically shot down over Armenia while performing a COMINT mission. At that time, tapes and transcripts were made of Soviet fighter air-to-ground communications reflecting the shoot-down. The shoot-down, which resulted in the death of all on board, precipitated an international incident. After the Soviets repeatedly denied shooting down the C-130, the US gave copies of the shoot-down transcripts to UN ambassadors, including the Soviet ambassador.*

(C) More than ten years ago, while doing research for his book, " Price of Vigilance ," which describes the circumstances of the shoot-down, Larry Tart, who had flown with in the same USAF unit which had lost the C-130, attempted to obtain a copy of the tape and transcripts from NSA. At that time, the Office of Policy \& Records asked to make copies of the old transcripts, but subsequently denied Mr. Tart's request for release of the material.
(C) During a recent, casual conversation, Larry happened to mention to that he had gotten a call from someone in the Office of Policy \& Records who said he was re-reviewing Larry's FOIA request, but was not sure he could locate the tapes and transcripts. Luckily, had kept copies of the tapes and transcripts in his desk and he contacted the reviewer at the Office of Policy \& Records, who then requested that he verify the accuracy of the tapes and transcripts.
(C) After checking the audio intercept and the transcript, passed his findings to the Office of Policy \& Records for use in its FOIA review. He probably now holds the record for term QC (quality control) -- reviewing intercept almost 50 years old!
(U//FOUO) There is one more twist to the story. While researching his book, Larry worked with NSA Director General Kenneth Minihan to arrange for the acquisition of the C-130A that is now in National Vigilance Park, refurbished to look exactly like the aircraft which was shot down over Armenia in 1958.
