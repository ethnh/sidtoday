(U//FOUO) What's It Take To Be an IA? Please Voice Your Opinion
FROM: Cindy Farkus
NSA/CSS Senior Intelligence Authority and Assistant Deputy Director for A\&P (S2)
Run Date: 06/05/2006
(U//FOUO) What are the foundational knowledge, skills and abilities that all intelligence analysts need? Do you think you know the answer? If so, now is the time to bring your suggestions to the table! Read on for more details.
(U//FOUO) The Intelligence Community Reform and Terrorist Act of 2004 and the WMD Commission report call for the design and implementation of programs to improve, refocus, and expand education and training that advances analytic proficiency. Back in January 2006, the leadership of the Intelligence Analysis Skill Community (IASC) held an offsite to take a strategic look at how best to do that and respond to the intelligence analysis challenges of the 21st century. (See the earlier SID today article .)
(U//FOUO) As promised, I'm keeping you informed of the IASC's strategic goals and our efforts to grow and nurture this critical element of our workforce. The Office of the Senior Intelligence Authority and the IASC, in partnership with ADET*, are conducting a formal Training Needs Assessment to identify the core competencies of analysis as it is performed in a cryptologic environment. The assessment is one of a number of actions we'll be taking to ensure that all NSA/CSS analysts will have the critical knowledge and skills necessary to do their jobs. It will also allow ADET to better posture its training and development efforts to meet mission needs.
(U//FOUO) However, we can't do this alone. We need your help! In the next few weeks you may receive an invitation to be a part of this effort to assist our consultants in the data-gathering stage. Your participation in focus groups, personal interviews, or on-the-job observations is critical to our success. If you are not contacted but would like to offer your ideas, insights, or suggestions, please contact:

Intelligence Analysis Skill Community Director, S S S, Office of the Senior Intelligence Authority, S S S, and S S S, and, Associate Dean, Center for Cryptology, S S S S.
(U) Thanks in advance for your cooperation. We look forward to hearing from you!
*(U) ADET = Associate Directorate for Education \& Training
