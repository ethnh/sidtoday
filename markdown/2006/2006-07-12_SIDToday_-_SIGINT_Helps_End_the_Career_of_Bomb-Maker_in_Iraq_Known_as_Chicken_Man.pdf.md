(S//SI) SIGINT Helps End the Career of Bomb-Maker in Iraq Known as 'Chicken Man'

(S//SI) Nine terrorists in Iraq - including a known manufacturer of improvised explosive devices - were killed or captured by US forces recently, with the help of a SIGINT-based targeting package from Menwith Hill Station (MHS).
(TS//SI//REL) Background: " FEZ " is a collaborative project run by MHS that focuses on intercepting SIGINT related to the Moroccan Islamic Fighting Group (GICM), a "most wanted" terrorist group currently shown as a critical gap (red) on the Strategic Mission Assessment. MHS Mission Operations partnered with the European SIGINT Center in Darmstadt, Germany to attempt to develop access to GICM activities, plans and intentions in North Africa and Europe.
(S//SI) IA intern makes a breakthrough: An Intelligence Analysis intern on tour at MHS found reporting on an Algerian bomb maker and GICM associate active in Iraq. Telephony analysis of the numbers associated with this individual revealed ties to known and suspected improvised explosive device (IED) networks and Mujahadeen groups in Iraq, as well as multiple, untasked but related, telephone numbers.
(S//SI) Following up on leads: The team identified three Iraqi GSM* numbers linked to the Algerian, and tasked those numbers for identification and characterization. The lead intelligence analyst and lead language analyst worked together over the next two weeks to identify additional leads both through call records and content analysis. Transcripts from one of the Iraqi GSM numbers confirmed they were seeing GICM-related communications: it showed activity related to the shootdown of a U.S. helicopter on 14 May, the death of non-Iraqi "brothers," and other insurgent-associated activity.
(S//SI) "Chicken Man" is identified: When a caller in one the transcripts referred to "chickens" falling from the sky (a reference to the downed US helicopter), he was nicknamed "Chicken Man." He was identified as a known IED manufacturer, evidently now working in association with GICM.
(S//SI) MHS-supplied targeting package leads to successful operation: MHS passed all of this information, via a Cryptologic Services Group, to US forces in Iraq. MHS then provided a targeting package to support a military operation against "Chicken Man" and his associates, and continued to monitor communications on all the handsets associated with this activity. MHS also worked with NSA/CSS Georgia to ensure ongoing around-the-clock support on these targets for the duration of the planning and operational period. All of this work paid off: operations on 23 and 25 May resulted in the capture and killing of nine, mostly foreign, insurgents, including the "Chicken Man."
(S//SI) Another lead being pursued: In the course of this target development, MHS identified another number associated with this group of insurgents. MHS tipped that information to GCHQ who had been monitoring the targets' Short Message Service activity but not their voice traffic. MHS successfully transitioned that target to GCHQ for additional monitoring in support of one of their ongoing operations.
