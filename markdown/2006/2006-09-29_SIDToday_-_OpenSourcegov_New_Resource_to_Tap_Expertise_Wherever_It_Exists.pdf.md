(U//FOUO) OpenSource.gov: New Resource to Tap Expertise 'Wherever It Exists'

FROM: David T. Moore
Office of the NSA/CSS Senior Intelligence Authority
Run Date: 09/29/2006
(U) Internet web page is set up to help intelligence analysts tap into open-source information.
(U) The WMD Commission Report concluded that the Intelligence Community needs to do a better job tapping expertise outside the US Government, and that "analysts who use open source information can be more effective than those who don't." Rather than simply reacting to secret information delivered routinely to their computers, good analysts now must ask "what do I need to know" about a particular subject, and actively search for, question, and evaluate data from many different sources.
(U//FOUO) Thanks to collaboration between the DNI's Analytic Outreach Initiative and the Open Source Center, Intelligence Community analysts have a new resource for information. The Analytic Outreach Page is now fully active on www.OpenSource.gov. If you don't have a password yet, just log onto the site from any unclassified US Government (USG) computer and sign up. After that, you can access it from any Internet connection using your password. The goal is to create one-stop shopping for outreach information in the Intelligence Community.
(U) The Analytic Outreach Page contains information on upcoming conferences, seminars, and workshops sponsored by IC and other USG agencies, as well as by private think tanks, on topics of interest to IC analysts. The Page also includes a Best Practices and Discussion Forum on Outreach (blog), summaries of conferences and other outreach production, and featured publications. There are direct links to:

- selected USG research resources (e.g., Congressional Research Service and US Institute of Peace);
- private think tanks (e.g., Carnegie, Brookings, and Middle East Institute);
- NGOs (e.g., International Crisis Group and International Foundation for Electoral Systems);
- centers of expertise; and
- relevant journals.

Additional content will be added over the coming months.
(U//FOUO) The site is hard password-protected, and information is unclassified/for official use only. Submission of notices of conferences, conference summaries, and other appropriate content is encouraged at the Unclassified//FOUO level. Contributions should be emailed to
