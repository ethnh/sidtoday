(S//SI) New Policy Affects SIGINT Development: The Unmasking of Canadian Phone Numbers

FROM:
SIGINT Policy (S02L1)
Run Date: 03/03/2006
(S//SI) New guidance from our Canadian partners gives the SIGINT Directorate additional flexibility to conduct contact-chaining involving Canadian phone numbers.
(S//SI) Specifically, in November 2005 the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) authorized NSA/SID - for the purposes of SIGINT development and under specified conditions -to cease the masking of Canadian phone, facsimile, and mobile numbers. This applies to Canadian numbers incidentally collected by NSA/CSS systems in the performance of SIGINT operations against foreign intelligence targets. ("Masking" is the process of minimizing numbers such that a complete number is not available for SIGINT analytic or reporting purposes.)
(S//SI) Under this new policy, the SIGINT Directorate:

- May utilize the Canadian number metadata in SIGINT Development contact-chaining analysis, but not as the primary subject.
- Will continue to minimize Canadian numbers in any SIGINT product or service.
- May retain unminimized Canadian numbers incidentally collected under this authority within the FASCIA II database.
- Will ensure that CSE receives all unmasked Canadian numbers via established forwarding means.
(S//SI) This permission to unmask Canadian numbers does not apply to metadata that is provided to NSA by CSE .
(U//FOUO) The signed Policy Memorandum, titled "SIGINT Development - Unmasking of Canadian Numbers ," can be found on the SIGINT Policy homepage ("go sigint policy").
(S//SI) This new policy is in keeping with the Alice Springs Resolution, which seeks to ensure that "intelligence results are captured and driven by the fullest possible search and analysis of data" across the Five-Eyes SIGINT community.
(U//FOUO) If you have questions regarding this policy, contact SIGINT Policy (S02L1) at
