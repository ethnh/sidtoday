(U//FOUO) Close-Out of P3 Cycle and Initiation of GG15-and-Below Promotion Cycle

FROM:
SID Performance Management Executive (S0)
Run Date: 01/30/2006
(U//FOUO) As you know, final P3 evaluations must be completed and submitted no later than 1600 on 3 February 2006. Now that the P3 deadline is rapidly approaching, it is time to start the next phase in the performance management process - the promotion cycle. Although the Agency promotion timeline has not been finalized, I know that the SID deadline to submit PRPs to supervisors will be in early March.
(U//FOUO) This note is to remind you to begin updating your Internal Staffing Resume (ISR) and assembling your Performance Review Package (PRP). Your PRP should contain your resume, your last three final P3s and interims at your current grade, and your employee profile once it is available on/about 1 March 2006. For guidance and examples of how to complete your ISR and PRP see the HRS awards web page.
(U//FOUO) Additional articles will be forthcoming detailing the promotion process and timeline, to include when and where to hand in your PRP, as well as how and when to pull your employee profile. I'll notify everyone of the link for the updated SID Workforce Performance Management home page once it is finalized. It will contain pertinent information about the upcoming promotion cycle.
