(U//FOUO) In December 2005, SID established a new body: the United States SIGINT System (USSS) Lessons-Learned Working Group (LLWG). Its job is to ensure that lessons learned regarding critical mission support are identified, shared, and incorporated into USSS procedures. The working group encourages the sharing of success stories as well as the discovery and remediation of mistakes. This initiative is in accordance with NSA/CSS Policy 1-31, which established an NSA Lessons Learned Program.
(U//FOUO) The USSS LLWG includes representatives from across the enterprise. They are helping the USSS LLWG achieve its goals as outlined in the Working Group Charter, and they are developing a comprehensive lessons-learned program for the USSS. The working group meetings will be held via Secure Video Teleconference (SVTC), from 1500-1700 EST to accommodate field sites. Everyone is invited to sit in and contribute. To participate, ensure that you have an IWS account on the DRAWMIND server. (Go to the IWS webpage and click on "Account Maint.") If you wish to simply observe the proceedings (without being an active participant), you may attend the meeting in the SID Conference Room (2N044).
