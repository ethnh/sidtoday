(U//FOUO) OpenSource.gov -- The Open-Source Community for All Agency Analysts

FROM:
AIRS/Center for Digital Content (S202A4)
Run Date: 10/31/2006
(U//FOUO) A wealth of worldwide open-source information and expertise is available to every NSA analyst and researcher at OpenSource.gov. Sponsored by the Open-Source Center (formerly FBIS), the portal offers an in-depth collection of information and analysis on topics like politics, military affairs, the environment, societal issues, economics, science and technology and the media.
(U//FOUO) The information is obtained from radio, television, press agencies, newspapers and other periodicals, books, websites, databases and gray literature* (approximately 3000 sources). Selected foreign-language items also have the vernacular version attached, and there are several Russian language publications and Cuban dissident files.
(U//FOUO) The portal is updated constantly and offers both country and subject-specific views. It contains a full range of multimedia, including pictures, maps, tables, audio and a video news server. In addition, OpenSource.gov has links to the subscription resources IEEE Electronic Library, Proquest News and Research, Stratfor International Intelligence Service and Business Monitor International.
(U//FOUO) One of the most exciting features on OpenSource.gov is the collection of blogs moderated by leaders in their fields. This includes the Analytic Outreach page mentioned in a recent SID today article, as well as blogs on China, North Korea, terrorist messaging, translation and library intelligence. Blogs are certainly an excellent arena for unclassified discussion of, and collaboration on, open source.
(U//FOUO) Access to opensource.gov is available to any NSA employee (including contractors). Just go to www.OpenSource.gov on any attributable (i.e., non-AIRGAP) unclassified computer system and register. As always, Advanced Intelligence Research Services (AIRS) is NSA's gateway to the Open Source Center and all of its services. Just type " go AIRS " in your NSALink browser for more information.
