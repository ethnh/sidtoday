(U//FOUO) New Process for Prioritizing SID's IT-Project Service Requests

FROM:
SIGINT Mission Interface for Information Technology (S01)
Run Date: 01/24/2006
(U//FOUO) A new process has been put in place for prioritizing all SID IT-project requests. "Projects" are defined as larger, more involved efforts (e.g. over 10 terminals, more that 40 telephones, etc.) that need to be scheduled and managed as opposed to the more simplistic "something is broken - please fix it" efforts. The below will explain who is involved in this project prioritization process and how it works.
(U//FOUO) Computing and telephony services are provided to most of the NSA Washington workforce by Eagle Alliance. The Information Technology Directorate (ITD) manages this contract. However, the Eagle Alliance contract is not all-inclusive. For example, it does not include support to SID employees located more than 50 -miles away from Fort Meade, nor does it include certain types of mission services, such as messaging, database support, development applications, etc. In these cases, services are provided directly by personnel from Internal Service Providers (ISP) in ITD rather than through the EA contractor.
(U//FOUO) Regardless of whether EA or ITD is providing support, all SID IT service requests are submitted through the Remedy system for handling. IT service requests fall into two categories: ones that have a facilities (LF) component and ones that do not.

Facilities Service Requests
(U//FOUO) Requests that have a facilities component are prioritized and scheduled by the Facilities Services (LF) organization.

Non-Facilities Service Requests
(U//FOUO) For requests that do NOT have a LF component, we have developed a new prioritization process. Here's how it works:

1. Once a month, all Remedy system requests assigned to ITD and EA will be retrieved.
2. The retrieved requests are sorted according to whichever SID Directorate (S0, S1, S2, and S3) it came from, and distributed to each Directorate for prioritization into bands. (Note: Prioritization within a band is mostly determined by the "need by" date.)

- Band 1 - Crisis and DIRNSA Priority
- Band 2 - Project/Mission Priority
- Band 3 - Routine

3. The prioritized Directorate lists are then merged into a one-up prioritized SID list by the SMI-IT (SIGINT Mission Interface for Information Technology) team and the SID Directorates' IT Points of Contact.
4. The SID list is forwarded to the Customer Project Prioritization Panel (CPPP) where it is merged with requests from the rest of the enterprise (The SMI IT represents SID on the CPPP).
5. The final enterprise list is forwarded to the ITD for execution.
(U//FOUO) This new project prioritization process was established to generate and forward a comprehensive, vetted, prioritized list of SID projects to the service providers. This list is reviewed as necessary to ensure that IT services are continuously in line with changing mission priorities and allocated responsibilities.
