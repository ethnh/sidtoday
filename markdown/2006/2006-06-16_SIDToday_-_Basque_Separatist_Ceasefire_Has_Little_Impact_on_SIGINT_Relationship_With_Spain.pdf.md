(S//SI) Basque Separatist Ceasefire Has Little Impact on SIGINT Relationship With Spain

(U) ETA remains the focus.
(U) The Basque separatist group ETA declared a permanent ceasefire on 22 March 2006 after almost four decades of attacks in Spain. The announcement could signify the end of one of Western Europe's bloodiest guerrilla campaigns and be the beginning of a democratic process to construct a new framework for the establishment of an independent state in northern Spain and southwest France.
(U) Caution reigns heavy, however, as the ETA has twice broken ceasefires in the 1990s. Furthermore, it is unclear how many of the 2.1 million Basques want an independent state run by the moderate Basque Nationalist Party. Spain's government is not totally void of optimism. Spain's Deputy Prime Minister, Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, has hailed the ceasefire as "good news for all Spaniards." She added, though, that the government has a responsibility to be more prudent than ever and that the government desires this ceasefire to be "the beginning of the end."

(S//SI) So, how does this impact the SIGINT relationship between NSA and Spain's Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (CNI, the National Intelligence Center)? The NSA-CNI SIGINT partnership has been built on the ETA target set since 2002, and despite some minor modifications to increase the focus areas, the partnership remains a counterterrorism-centric exchange that jointly prosecutes ETA communications. Immediately following the ceasefire announcement, CNI's Chief of SIGINT, $\square$ informed the NSA SIGINT Liaison Officer in Madrid that nothing has changed for the CNI.
(S//SI) In fact, $\square$ believes that the ceasefire announcement and ETA talks with the government of Spain will cause some heretofore unlocated exiles to poke their heads up and make some calls back home to see if their particular status will change. These communications, many of which originate in Latin America, will carry a high priority. Finally, according to press, the Prime Minister has ordered the State Security Forces and the CNI to verify if the "permanent ceasefire" is "total and definitive." Much work lies ahead to verify that attacks and acts of street violence have ceased and to measure the ETA's recruitment, training, procurement, and financial activities.
(U) Politically, the ETA announcement has proven a major victory for Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and his government, which had been accused of being weak on terrorism. The breakthrough with ETA will likely benefit the Socialist Party through the 2008 general elections.
(U) ETA Facts:

- ETA means Basque Homeland and Freedom (Basque Language: Euskadi Ta Askatasuna)
