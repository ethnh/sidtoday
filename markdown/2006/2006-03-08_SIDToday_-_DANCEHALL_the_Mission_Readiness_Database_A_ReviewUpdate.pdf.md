(U//FOUO) DANCEHALL (the Mission Readiness Database): A Review/Update

FROM:
Dancehall Team Lead (S01)
Run Date: 03/08/2006
(U//FOUO) NSA has thousands of analysts engaged in the pursuit of Signals Intelligence and Information Assurance missions. How do we document these activities and ensure that analysts are deployed against missions in a way that is consistent with national priorities and maximizes limited resources?
(U//FOUO) One mechanism is DANCEHALL, a SID-supported multifaceted project that helps SID organizations, the Cryptologic Centers, and the NTOC to account for all civilian and military (Active and Reserve) personnel performing cryptologic missions throughout the global enterprise. Eventually this capability will include the Mission Ground Stations, field sites and other external activities conducting SIGINT missions.
(U//FOUO) DANCEHALL is a relational database through which individuals 1) document their skills and mission data and 2) query and/or apply for job vacancies. It also allows managers to:

- optimize staffing as missions and priorities change,
- identify tools and training that may be needed, and
- understand current analytic resource deployments.
(U//FOUO) The analyst profile tool allows you to document in the DANCEHALL database your cryptologic skills and knowledge, and the missions that you are working. This data is then provided to the ODNI ARC database. Once entered, your individual profile is saved and must be updated whenever you change jobs, assume a new mission, acquire a new skill, or feel you have significantly increased your proficiency in one of these areas.
(U//FOUO) The Dancehall Team is currently working with NSA organizations to expand the database to identify fields that apply to other skill areas like management, staff, customer relations, and data acquisition so all the SID workforce can enter their skill profiles and missions into the DANCEHALL database.
(U//FOUO) The data in the DANCEHALL database helps to inform internal mission management decisions as well as respond to external queries from Congress and the Intelligence Community (IC) on mission readiness and resource allocation. Because the data is used in this way, and to make sure that training needs and resource gaps are correctly identified, it is essential that you document your profile accurately. Please note that you will not be subjected to an involuntary directed assignment solely on the basis of the skills information provided.
(U//FOUO) One of the most influential activities that DANCEHALL supports is the DDNI/A* Analytic Resource Catalog (ARC), an IC database of analysts, their missions, skills, knowledge, and abilities. Analysts throughout the IC are required to update their individual profiles every six months and this data is forwarded to the ARC. This semiannual mandatory event was scheduled to begin again in May 2006. This has now been moved to Summer 2006. NSA will forward data contained in DANCEHALL to fulfill this requirement. The data that is provided is now used to populate the ARC Yellow Pages. See ODNI email on the ARC Yellow Pages. More to come on this!
(U//FOUO) Another (separate) feature provided by DANCEHALL is the capability to view and apply for advertised positions. DANCEHALL is used by civilian and military analysts as well as managers throughout SID. Through the CVA application, you can scan the vacancies, market your skills, and apply online for missions to which you can contribute. If you are looking for an exciting challenge, and/or a rotational assignment, or to add/update your skills profile, check out the link at "go Dancehall."
(U//FOUO) DANCEHALL depends on you. Please help us make DANCEHALL effective. Watch for
