(U) Much ink has been spilled since SID today ran its first article on March 31, 2003. To mark this 3-year anniversary, we will soon announce the winner of the annual Sidney Award for "most popular SID today article of the year."
(U) The Sidney is bestowed upon the article from the previous 12 months that received the most positive feedback comments. So, this year we'll be reviewing the feedback for articles running March 31, 2005 - March 30, 2006 to determine the winner.
(U) If you'd like to "cast a vote" for this year's Sidney, send an email to and tell us your favorite article.
