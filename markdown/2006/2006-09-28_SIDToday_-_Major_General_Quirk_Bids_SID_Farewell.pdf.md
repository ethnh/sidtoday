(U) Major General Quirk Bids SID Farewell

FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
SIGINT Director
Run Date: 09/28/2006
(U) It's time to say farewell. This will be my last SID today article, because I am retiring from the Army on 30 September. It has been a great career of 37 years and I can think of no better way and no better place to close this chapter of our lives and open the next.
(U) I leave you inspired, filled with appreciation, and absolutely confident in the future security of our nation. It is you who have inspired me and who have always recharged my optimism and permitted me to leave with such confidence. I have never been associated with a finer, more dedicated, more professional group of people.
(U) Despite the difficulties and challenges of your jobs, you should come to work and go home every day filled with pride because of what you accomplish here. I certainly feel that pride for you. During these five years, I've seen you at work enough to know that you are truly a national treasure, and I am truly confident about your continued accomplishment of our vital mission in the future.
(U) My appreciation is for the many ways that each of you has shared your thoughts and concerns and yourselves with me in our daily interactions. Most of us old guys say that we hang around because of the people. What we really mean is that we hang around because of the close relationships we build with people, and I have found that here at NSA/CSS, it has been easy to build those relationships. It is because of you that I have been excited about staying on two years past my mandatory retirement date.
(U//FOUO) I must especially express my appreciation to Gen Hayden and LTG Alexander for giving me these two extra years. And finally, a special thanks to Charlie Meals and Jim Cusick, my deputies, and to $\square$ who, as Office Manager, put up with more schedule changes and other changes of mind and quirks than anyone should have to.
(U) My job was a dream come true, because every day the people I worked with were in the habit of making the impossible a reality... ahead of schedule. It has been a little bit like Alice behind the looking glass in that every day has been filled with wonder. I thank all of you for the experience.
(U) Maura and I will finally begin to burn diesel in our motor home. We will head north to Maine and points unknown. We hope to keep our close friendships with all of you. God bless.
