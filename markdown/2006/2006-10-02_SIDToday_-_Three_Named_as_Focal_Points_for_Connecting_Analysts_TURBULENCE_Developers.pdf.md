(S//SI) Three Named as Focal Points for Connecting Analysts, TURBULENCE Developers

FROM: Cindy Farkus
SID/Assistant Deputy Director for A\&P (S2)
Run Date: 10/02/2006
(S//SI) As the director's Transformation 3.0 initiative, and the TURBULENCE implementation actualizing it, becomes concrete, the time to begin planning the use of these new capabilities within the mainstream SIGINT analysis and production process is upon us. To this end, I have named focal points within the SID organizations involved in analysis. These are:

- For SSG, Corporate SIGINT Development: Gregory L. Wessel;
- For S2, Analysis and Production: and
- For S3, Data Acquisition:

(S//SI) With the wide range of TURBULENCE (TU) and other Transformation 3.0 (T 3.0) capabilities starting to come on-line, the need to begin to place each in its proper operational context is clear. In addition to bringing in the knowledge of TU and T 3.0 deployments, the above-named focal points will also be responsible for gathering their respective organizations' inputs, coordinating these inputs with existing requirements processes, and providing support to help prioritize ongoing and future TU work.
(S//SI) Mr. Wessel currently serves as the Technical Leader for SIGINT Development. He has worked in the SIGDEV arena since coming to SID in 2000. His expertise encompasses network analysis, network mapping and reconstruction of data, metadata analysis, and architecture design and implementation. He has worked with the analytic community on dictionary and selector management, is responsible for the development of GLOBALVISION and is a Masterlevel Computer Scientist and Information Systems Security Analyst. Mr. Wessel is a graduate of the Senior Technical Development Program and the advocate for the Global Network Analyst Development Program.
(S//SI) a long-serving master-level Intelligence Analyst, has worked in a variety of SIGINT production organizations. He is very familiar with analytic tools and techniques, has authored SIGINT product reports, and has repeatedly been called upon in various crises to perform intelligence analysis in support of customers from the tactical level to national decisionmakers. , a graduate of the Senior Technical Development Program, has also worked as a voice language analyst, collection operator and manager, and, for many years, in target development and network exploitation.
(S//SI) is the Technical Director for the Exploitation Solutions Office in the Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services Group. He has many years of experience in designing and developing software to convert raw traffic into an intelligible form for analysts. His experiences range from front-end collection systems to back-end analytic tools and include both circuit-switched and packet-switched technologies, as well as many different media types. He has also had much success in designing and developing application frameworks and common application programming interfaces (APIs) for the SIGINT domain.
(S//SI) These focal points will be interfacing to other key players in the Analysis and Production Lane, including:

- the Lane Technical Lead, Dr. Curt Boylls;
- the Lane System Engineer, and
- the TU Analytics Technical Lead

(U//FOUO) Analysts: if you have any questions or concerns relating to the operational use of T 3.0 capabilities, please contact the focal point for your organization. Their sids are:
