(TS//SI//REL) SCS Baghdad Teams With Brits to Help Free Hostages FROM: $\square$
SCS Iraqi Issues Coordinator (F615)

(TS//SI//REL) Special Collection Service (SCS) Baghdad provided significant SIGINT support during the week of 23 March that resulted in the rescue of three Western hostages. The SCS site teamed with the Baghdad Fusion Cell and Coalition Forces for several nights to identify, geolocate, and capture the high-value terrorist targets.
(TS//SI//REL) During the night of 23 March, the site worked closely with GCHQ* to eliminate incorrect targets through voice identification. This enabled the team to isolate the specific terrorist believed to be holding the hostages.
(TS//SI//REL) Coalition forces successfully launched the rescue in western Baghdad, captured the hostage holders, and rescued a Briton (pictured) and two Canadians -- members of Christian peacekeeping missions in Iraq. The pressure from this operation (Operation FAILSAFE) is probably what eventually caused the captors to release American Jill Carroll the following week.
