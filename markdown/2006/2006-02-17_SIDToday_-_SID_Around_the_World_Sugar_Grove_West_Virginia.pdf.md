(U//FOUO) SID Around the World: Sugar Grove, West Virginia

FROM:
Naval Information Operations Command, Sugar Grove Run Date: 02/17/2006
(U//FOUO) Every year, SID today presents articles from SIGINTers working at some of the far-flung sites associated with NSA. We ask submitters to give a feel for what it is really like to live at that location. Here's our first "SID Around the World" article for 2006:
(U) Trees, mountains, streams, rivers, deer, bear, ruffled grouse, red and gray squirrels, red and gray foxes, possums, skunks, caves, rock climbing, skiing, winding roads, red tail hawks, eagles, coyotes, cattle, sheep, horses, people, pigs, chickens... what else can I add - it is all here. "Wild, Wonderful" Sugar Grove, West Virginia. It is all that and more. The base is located near a community called Sugar Grove, location of one store/post office and on the South Fork of the Potomac River, which occasionally likes to expand its banks.
(S) There are actually two locations which are NIOC (Naval Information Operations Command) Sugar Grove. One site is down by the river and has housing, administration, public works, gym, commissary and Navy exchange. The second site is about 3 miles away on top of the mountain. Here is where the operational mission is located in an underground building. At any time of day driving up the mountain to work, I can see deer, turkeys, squirrels and the occasional bear.

(U) The area surrounding the site is beautiful. The height of the mountains is around 3,000 feet and mountains can be seen in any direction one looks. The valleys contain farm houses, new development and businesses. The nearest town, Franklin, is located about $1 / 2$ hour away, and has about a population of about 800. It has a grocery store, Family Dollar, Rite Aid, flower shops, bed and breakfast, motels and the only stop light in the county. The primary shopping area is Harrisonburg, VA, about 40 miles away. Of course going over Shenadoah Mountain with its 25 mph curves is fun, especially in the winter. Sometimes in the winter with a heavy snow, the mountain will be closed until the roads are plowed. Oh well, staying home is nice. Winter driving is different, with snow, black ice and curvy roads. But, four-wheel drive and front wheel drive vehicles were made for exciting driving.
(U) There are plenty of things to do here. Three ski resorts are located within 2 hours, spelunking for those who like the darkness, Cass railroad tour, Seneca Rocks caves for those who want guided cave tours with lights, National Radio Astronomy Observatory is only an hour away and of course there is great hunting and fishing. If you want to shop or go to the movies, all you need to do is go to Harrisonburg where there are plenty of restaurants and stores.

(U) The best part about living here is the quietness and the animal life. Rarely does a day go by when I don't see wildlife and have to avoid several deer. Laughter is generated when the lambs chase and play with each other. Serenity is watching a beautiful sunset and sunrise over the mountains and watching the snow falling covering the ground and the trees. Standing outside taking in the fresh air every day has made me realize how lucky I am to be working at NIOC Sugar Grove, WV.
