(U//FOUO) Venture Capital Funding Available: InnoVisions Call for Proposals

FROM:
Technical Director, InnoVisions (S22N)
Run Date: 07/20/2006
(U) Proposals are being accepted from the entire SID workforce.
(U//FOUO) Do you know of a commercial product that could be used to great effect in SIGINT operations? Do you have a better idea on processes and/or procedures that could accelerate SIGINT support forward? Would you like the opportunity to implement your idea? If so, this is your chance - InnoVisions (S22N) has issued a call for venture capital proposals, open to the entire SID workforce.
(U//FOUO) What is InnoVisions? It provides proof-of-concept demonstrations of early stage and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies against real-world SIGINT problems. The technology to retool the SIGINT system, in most cases, already exists. What is lacking is the creative environment that encourages innovation, rewards risk-taking and is result-oriented, not process-oriented. Innovisions fills that gap. We are not a center of innovation, but rather a network of innovators.
(S//SI) We are assembling new venture capital starts, and solicit your suggestions for (1) specific challenges and/or projects against which we can match COTS and GOTS (Government-off-the-shelf) technology or (2) specific ideas for prototyping activities within the SID. This quarter, special emphasis is being given to the following topics:

- Prototyping Processes and Procedures for Improved SIGINT Support to Forward-Deployed Forces
- Innovations to Move Tactically Relevant Data Forward Faster
- Innovative Designs to Support The Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force

However, submissions can be from any organization and cover any topic. Type " go innovations" in your browser to get more details on current and past projects.
(C//SI) If you have an idea that you think can benefit the SID enterprise, could be demonstrated in 6-12 months, and cost less than $\$ 0.5 \mathrm{M}$ (the lower the dollar amount, the better), we invite you to tell us your idea. It is requested that proposals be submitted by COB 4 August 2006. Notification of award of these prestigious grants will occur around the end August 2006.
(U//FOUO) How do I submit my idea? The InnoVisions "catechism" is the model by which all proposals are submitted to InnoVisions for consideration. For details, see the section on Catechisms on this webpage: Innovisions projects webpage
...or they can be emailed (plain text, rtf, or MS Word, preferred) to

( $\mathrm{U} / / \mathrm{FOUO})$ The InnoVisions Catechism:
Please answer these eight questions in the context of your venture capital proposal:

1. What are you trying to do?
2. How is it done today?
3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will work?
4. Assuming success, what difference will it make? (How will it be deployed and used, who will use it, etc.?)
5. What are the risks and what is your risk reduction plan?
6. How long will it take?
7. How much will it cost?
8. What are the mid-term and final exams?
