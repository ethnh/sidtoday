(U) The A-B-Cs of Determining an Officer's Rank

FROM: (U//FOUO) SIGINT Communications (S02C) Run Date: 08/21/2006
(U) Civilians: do you know how to spot a military member's rank?
(U) Each rank in the US military has its own insignia. For the warrant officer and enlisted ranks, these insignia differ from one Service to the next, which makes for quite a few different variables. Luckily (for beginners), insignia for commissioned officers are the same across all of the military Services, and therefore are a good place to start.
(U) There are a total of 10 commissioned officer pay grades, O-1 (the lowest) through O-10 (the highest). Each pay grade has a unique insignia associated with it, as you'll see below. These insignia are worn on the collar and (depending on the Service and the uniform) on shoulder epaulettes.
(U) Note, however, that within the pay grades, the rank titles vary: for officers, one title is used by the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps, and another title is used by the Navy and Coast Guard. Note also that the insignia for O-1/O-2, and for O-4/O-5 are the same except for their color. In both cases, the silver represents a higher rank than the gold.

# O-6 Insignia: Silver eagle 

Colonel (Army/Air Force/Marine Corps) ( informally called a "full, bird Colonel ") or Captain (Navy/Coast Guard) (Note that a Navy or Coast Guard Captain (O-6) is a higher rank than a Captain in the other Services (O-3).)

Flag Officers (often referred to as "one-star," "two-star," etc.):

## O-7 Insignia: One silver star

Brigadier General (Army/Air Force/Marine Corps) or
Rear Admiral [Lower Half] (Navy/Coast Guard)

(U) Naval and Coast Guard officers wear additional "sleeve-type" insignia on some of their uniforms, which we won't get into here. For details on that, see the document Rank Recognition in a Joint Service Environment, from which this article is derived.
