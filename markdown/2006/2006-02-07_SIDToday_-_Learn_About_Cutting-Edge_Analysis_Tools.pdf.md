(S//SI) Need an analysis tool? The Target Knowledge Branch (TKB) might just have what you need! The TKB is part of Tailored Access Operations (TAO) and specializes in device geolocation and target-space analysis. TKB has developed a number of cutting-edge analysis tools that provide support to both TAO and non-TAO customers. TKB's tools and services successfully contribute to the global war on terrorism and are being used by such customers as military troops in Iraq.
(S//SI) TKB has developed a three-pronged approach towards its mission: KNOW IT, SHOW IT, and PLACE IT. Our tools and programs are built around this philosophy.
(S//SI) KNOW IT addresses dataflow and metadata storage, metrics, analysis, and statistics. The RETURNSPRING project processes metadata from SIGINT collection systems for the purpose of display and analysis as well as enrichment of corporate data.
(S//SI) SHOW IT describes visualization tools. The DRAGONVIEW/NetWiz 505 tool is an 802.11 analysis tool that displays both the logical and physical views of collected 802.11 data. The EAGLEVIEW tool is a raw GSM survey file processing and analysis tool.
(S//SI) PLACE IT refers to geolocation and RF propagation modeling. The SOFFITPORT project provides services supporting the selection and placement of RF bridging devices.
(U//FOUO) One of TKB's high priorities is getting the word out about our tools. After all, how useful can our tools be if those who need them don't know about them? Advertising has been instrumental in informing the workforce about our products and services. TKB recently created a 3-minute multimedia video presentation that gives an overview of TKB and showcases our products. Take a moment to view this video (make sure your speakers are on!) and see if we might have the analysis tool (or tools) you need. The URL is:
