(U) Internet Remote-Access Accounts Now Available

FROM:
AIRS/Center for Digital Content (S202A4)
Run Date: 10/17/2006
(U//FOUO) New option allows remote access (from any UNCLASSIFIED computer) to the Internet, including Intelligence Community content posted on it.
(U) If you're putting in a request for an Unclassified (i.e. Internet) account, you may notice a new choice under the "Request an Account Action " box on the Eagle Alliance (EA) Online ITHelp Form, namely "Intelink-SBU." Just what sort of account is that?
(U//FOUO) An Intelink-SBU account provides remote access to what was formerly known as OSIS (Open Source Information System) and is now known as Intelink-U (there was a brief period when it was also known as Intelink-SBU, and the ticket page has just not caught up yet). OSIS and all of its material migrated to the Intelink-U construct as of 1 June,* and this account represents the newest and, as yet, most far-reaching way to access the Internet and get to see Intelligence Community (IC) content.
(U//FOUO) Since it is a remote access account, you can sign into your account from the login page (https://www.intelink.gov) from any UNCLASSIFIED computer anywhere. It's a webbased application using SSL, so you don't need any special clients or modems in order to login.
(U//FOUO) Once you login, you will see the unclassified version of the MyIntelink portal (it looks just like what's available at MyIntelink on the classified side), complete with pages and information from a variety of IC, Defense and Law Enforcement organizations, and all at the Unclassified level. This account also provides you with access to all the MyIntelink services, including blogs, email and net storage as well as access to subscription resources that the IC buys for all its members; things like Jane's, EIU and EbscoHost. There is also an unclassified version of the Intellipedia (the IC wiki) on Intelink-U.
(U//FOUO) One caveat: it's always important that you know the rules of Internet access here at NSA. The basic document is NSA/CSS Policy 6-6 Use of Unclassified Information Systems Such as the Internet. In addition, the Center for Digital Content (CDC) within Advanced Intelligence Research Services (AIRS) has put together a thorough overview listing all the pertinent Agency policies regarding Internet use, and provides numerous working aids related to Internet use and research. In addition, field elements should begin their process with their local IT support folks.
(U//FOUO) For information related to obtaining an unclassified Intelink Remote Access or Intelink-U account, use the EA Online Help Form, or call E-10. Any questions about Intelink-U content should be directed to the Center for Digital Content at DL DIGITAL.
