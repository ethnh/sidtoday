(U//FOUO) On 22 September 2006, the Chief of CSE (Canada's Communications Security Establishment), John Adams, visited NSA to celebrate CSE's 60th anniversary. The NSA event, held in the Canine Suite Annex, was one of several anniversary celebrations, to include proceedings held in Canada and the UK. The NSA festivities culminated with speeches by John and DIRNSA and the presentation of a letter from DIRNSA to the CSE workforce. The event was well attended and reflected NSA's commitment to and enjoyment of our partnership with CSE.

(U) A brief history of CSE follows:

# (U) Origins in WWII 

(U//FOUO) Formal Canadian SIGINT activity began during the Second World War when the Royal Canadian Navy established a Discrimination Unit to exploit Operational SIGINT. The Army and Air Force followed suit and by the War's end the military units joined to form the Joint Royal Canadia Unit (JDU) under Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Drake. Drake also promoted the creation of a civilian cryptologic centre for Canada, and so in June 1941, the Examination Unit (XU) was established, headed first by the famed American cryptologist Herbert Yardley and then the legendary Briton Oliver Strachey.

## (U//FOUO) "Comms Branch" Stands Up in 1946

(U//FOUO) Following the end of the war, Canada retained a small peacetime SIGINT effort. On 13 April 1946, an Order in Council authorized 179 classified positions for the "essential" continuation "of work of great value not only to Canada but also to the United Kingdom and the United States." On 3 September 1946, Lieutenant-Colonel Drake and his military staff exchanged their uniforms for civilian dress and reported to work at the newly created Communications Branch of the National Research Council (CBNRC).

## (U//FOUO) ...and Becomes CSE in 1975

(U//FOUO) In 1974, the Canadian Broadcasting Company aired a television program, "The Espionage Establishment," that exposed CBNRC's involvement in SIGINT. As a result of the unwelcome publicity, the government transferred CBNRC, on 1 April 1975, to the Department of National Defence as the Communications Security Establishment.
