# (S//SI) NSAG Supports Successful Raid in Western Iraq

(TS//SI) Intelligence provided by NSA/CSS Georgia (NSAG) contributed directly to a successful raid on an insurgent safe house in western Iraq on 19 March. For several weeks leading up to the operation, NSAG's Iraq Division (GS2E2) produced tips, KLIEGLIGHT reports, and endproduct assessments on a mujahidin cell in Julaybah, near Ramadi. The reports identified clear links between the Iraqi mujahidin and foreign fighters, specifically their use of improvised explosive devices and mortars to attack U.S. and Coalition forces. These details, along with SIGINT-derived geolocational information, were incorporated into targeting packages prior to the operation.
(TS//SI) As a result of the raid, 3 foreign fighters were killed and 13 Iraqi mujahidin fighters were captured, disrupting the Julaybah cell's operations and leading to a significant lapse in COMSEC (communications security) by the insurgent leaders. Work against this insurgent cell continues, and GS2E2 analysts have recently linked these personnel to other insurgent groups in the Ramadi and Habbaniyah areas. This includes a Ghazwan-based network that was preparing, in late January, to employ chemical gas in an attack against Coalition forces.
(TS//SI) The Julaybah cell success is typical of the national-tactical collaboration evident in the western Iraq effort. Analysts from NSAG, RAINFALL, and the U.S. Marine 1st Radio Battalion work together to discover new cordless phone networks, confirming suspicious activities before passing them to COBRA FOCUS (a tactical support activity for U.S. and Coalition forces in Iraq) and the GS2E2 Iraq target office.
(TS//SI) In turn, GS2E2 analysts incorporate national collection information processed locally (from OVERHEAD and AIRHANDLER assets) with collection from assets on the ground in Iraq (1st Radio PROPHET HAMMER systems transferred via ONEROOF, GUARDRAIL, and Iraqi SIGINT Elements). In total, the team has provided hundreds of KLIEGLIGHT and product reports to U.S. troops on the ground, including 51 reports with "REL IRQ" tearlines.
