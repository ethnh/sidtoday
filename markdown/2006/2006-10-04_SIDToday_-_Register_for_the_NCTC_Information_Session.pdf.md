(U) Exciting opportunities at the front lines of collaboration: The DNI's National Counterterrorism Center.
(U//FOUO) Interested in learning about how counterterrorism analysis is done in the ultimate collaborative environment? Customer Gateway and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) are hosting an NCTC information session on Friday, 20 October from 0830 to 1130 in HQS 9A135 (see the the agenda ). This is your opportunity to hear directly from your colleagues on the front lines of collaborative analysis against the most challenging current and emerging threats. To register, contact the SID Account Manager for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), at
(U//FOUO) Established by Executive Order (EO) $13354{ }^{1}$ and legislated as part of the DNI in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) of $2004{ }^{2}$, the NCTC is chartered "to become the nation's center of excellence for terrorism and counterterrorism issues, orchestrating and shaping the national and international effort to eliminate the terrorist threat to U.S. interests at home and abroad." The Center has established itself as the primary provider of CT information to the national leadership, and contributes information to the President's Daily Brief and a number of other high-level reports, bulletins, alerts and advisories. NCTC representatives also brief the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence (PDDNI) on terrorism issues.
(U//FOUO) The Directorate of Intelligence is the IC's center for terrorism analysis, with a diverse work force drawn from over 17 federal agencies. Detailees to NCTC have access to all of the U.S. Government's information on terrorism, including non-disseminated operational traffic. Other directorates govern global terrorism situational awareness, crisis response, information sharing, advanced analytic techniques, red teaming, and a host of radically new CT initiatives.
(U//FOUO) DNI Negroponte put it best: "The initiative, creativity, and insight that are the hallmarks of our colleagues across the IC are the backbone and strength of our contribution to the Nation's security. Indeed, no one has better ideas about how to improve the IC and make it succeed than you -- the IC professionals who know it best." ${ }^{3}$ We invite you to learn more about the exciting initiatives underway at the NCTC.
