(U) NSA is privileged to host two veterans of the effort at Bletchley Park, who will share their memories of that exciting time. Sir Arthur Wilfred ("Bill") Bonsall, who later rose to become director of GCHQ, began his career as a language analyst at BP and Maureen Miller Rodgers, a "WREN" at Bletchley Park, worked on the "bombe" machines that defeated the German Enigma machine. Following a short presentation on Bletchley Park by Dave Hatch, the NSA Historian, they will answer questions about their experiences at BP.
(U) As the wartime home of the Government Code \& Cypher School, predecessor to today's Government Communications Headquarters, BP was the place where this brainpower exploited the high-level communications of Nazi Germany and other Axis powers. The information developed at Bletchley Park was the secret underpinning for many of the crucial military and political decisions in World War II.
