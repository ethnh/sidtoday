(U) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present the last in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for 2006. "Bringing Down a Dictator: The fall of Milosevic and the role of Nonviolent Conflict" will be presented by Ms. D/SINIO for Economics and Global Issues, and Ms. D/SINIO for Russia, Europe, and Eurasia.

# Course Overview: 

(U//FOUO) Strategic nonviolent conflict is most effective method of toppling dictatorial regimes and forcing change in repressive social systems, yet is one of the least analyzed and understood phenomena. "Bringing down a Dictator," a PBS film, documents the spectacular defeat of Slobodan Milosevic in October 2000 by a nonviolent strategy of massive civil disobedience. A discussion on what has happened since and nonviolent movements as change agents will follow the film.
