(U//FOUO) Preparing for the SID 2007 Inventory, a Look at SID's 2006 Inventory Pitfalls

(U//FOUO) Through good accounting practices, we can account for an even higher percentage of SID equipment next year.
(U//FOUO) Thanks to the hard work of everyone in SID, the 2006 inventory was successfully completed, as $\mathbf{9 9 . 4 4 \%}$ of SID's accountable equipment was located (see related article.).
(U//FOUO) This was an extraordinary feat, considering the amount of equipment (over 40,000 pieces) that SID has in the Defense Property Accountability System (DPAS), NSA's property accounting database. In fact, this achievement is even more impressive when consideration is taken regarding reorganizations and the frequent movement of both equipment and personnel throughout the year.
(U//FOUO) However, in light of this remarkable accomplishment, 232 items were not found. In an effort to improve on last year's inventory totals, the SID Property Office has identified some pitfalls that contributed to the lost of equipment; please keep these shortfalls in mind as we prepare for the SID Inventory 2007:

# Lack of notification when moving Agency property 

- Any employee who is involved with the movement of Agency Owned Accountable Property, recognizable by a NSA barcode tag, must notify an assigned Property Officer (PO). This will allow the PO to take the necessary measures to ensure proper accounting and tracking throughout the move; this is a critical step to achieving a successful inventory.


## Lack of proper documentation

- Items being moved, transferred, or shipped must always have the proper documentation generated and sent to the appropriate PO or Property Administrative Officer (PAO) to reflect the move action. Here are some form examples:
- Form DD1149_Requisition and Invoice//Shipment Document;
- Form J6576_Transfer of Accountable Equipment;
- Form A1295_Transmittal of Material;
- Form J9497_Storage/Withdrawal Request; and
- Form J2151_Turn-In Excess Equipment Request.)

Findings have shown that the majority of missing equipment was lost due to the lack of properly generated documentation, which severely inhibits accurate property accounting and tracking.

## Lack of notification to relinquish ownership

- Any employee who leaves an organization for a new job must contact their office's appointed PO, to ensure that items assigned to them in their prior job are properly transferred to a new user via updating the DPAS database and issuing a new Form J1244A_Property Accounting Hand Receipt.
(U//FOUO) Correcting the shortcomings listed above will have a profound impact on the overall success of the SID inventory, both in 2007 and beyond. Many thanks go out to the SID employees for their diligent efforts to locate and maintain account for SID property, as it is the SID employees who play the most critical role in helping SID to reach their goal of a 100\% inventory. With everyone's help, the SID Property Office hopes to report a 100\% inventory in
2007
Thank you,
