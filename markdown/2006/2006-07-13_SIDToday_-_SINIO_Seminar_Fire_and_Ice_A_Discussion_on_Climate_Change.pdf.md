# Course Overview: 

(U) Climate change (most likely as a result of global warming) is expected to accelerate at an unprecedented rate over the coming decades and has already been linked to drought and related famine, shifts in precipitation, and the loss of fresh water resources. Extreme weather patterns are a growing threat as an increased population worldwide has resulted in greater numbers of people living in environmentally riskier areas. This seminar will outline the causes and effects of climate change as well as the international and domestic response, including multilateral efforts and current U.S. policy. Alternative viewpoints will also be addressed.
