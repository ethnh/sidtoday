(U) The Basics of 'REL TO'

FROM:
SID Classification Advisory Officer (S02L1)

(U//FOUO) Under what conditions can various types of government information be released to the general public, to Second Parties, or to Third Parties? Here's some information to clarify:
(U) First, let's look at unclassified information:

- (U) Information marked (U) may be releasable to the general public. However, if it is unclassified U.S. Government information, it must be approved for release to the public. Some unclassified U.S. Government information is not releasable to the public. FOUO (For Official Use Only) information may be withheld from the general public under the Freedom of Information Act. FOUO information may be releasable to our foreign partners under certain circumstances, but may not be assumed to always be releasable.
(U//FOUO) Now, let's look at SIGINT that has no control markings (e.g. it is marked TS//SI or S//SI):
- (U//FOUO) SIGINT that is not marked either NOFORN or with a REL TO is automatically releasable to our Second Party partners, based on the SISR ( Signals Intelligence Security Regulations) issued under the authority of the DCI in 1999.
(U//FOUO) ...Bear in mind that the above applies only to SIGINT:
- (U//FOUO) Documents marked C, S, or TS without a releasability marking are not releasable to any foreign partner unless they are SIGINT or SIGINT-related information. So, for example, TK or HCS material would not be automatically releasable to any foreign partner.
(U) How about Third Parties ? When can information be released to them?
- (U//FOUO) SIGINT or SIGINT-related information may not be released to Third Party partners in the absence of a REL TO, SIGINT Exchange designator or a DIDO (Designated Intelligence Disclosure Official) decision. Similarly, non-SIGINT information material may not be released to any foreign partners in the absence of a REL TO or DIDO decision.
(U) The CLASSIFY (email-based) tool has a 5-EYES default to remind users that classified information which is not 5-EYES must be encrypted before transmission across NSANet.
"(U//FOUO) SIDtoday articles may not be republished or reposted outside NSANet without the consent of S0121 (DL sid comms)."
