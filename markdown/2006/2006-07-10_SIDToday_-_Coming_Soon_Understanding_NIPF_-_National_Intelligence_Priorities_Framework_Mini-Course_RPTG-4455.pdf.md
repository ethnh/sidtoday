# (U) Course Overview: 

(C) The National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) is the guidance to the Intelligence Community (IC) for national intelligence priorities approved by the President in accordance with National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)-26. The NIPF serves as basic guidance for U.S. foreign intelligence analysis and collection. It is an implementation mechanism that translates national foreign intelligence objectives and priorities into specific prioritization guidance for the IC.
(C) The priorities that are the output of the NIPF are applicable to analysis and production management, collection allocation, acquisition decisions, and resource management. They guide the order in which requirements will be addressed and specify the resources appropriate to the effort. Similarly, when resource reallocation is necessary, the NIPF enables greater understanding of opportunity costs associated with alternative allocation choices.
(C) This four-hour mini-course will provide:

- an end-to-end examination of the NIPF;
- an overview of the NIPF implementation in the IC;
- results of the Topic Manager Assessment of Collection Against NIPF Topics; and
- an interactive exercise on relevancy rankings within Topic Manager Focus Groups.
