(U) New Policy for SIGINT Technical Information: Reporting Meets Reality

FROM:
Policy Services (S12P)
Run Date: 08/24/2006
(U//FOUO) The old digital-network intelligence policy is replaced with the more flexible STI policy.
(U//FOUO) The current policy and guidance on reporting digital-network intelligence (DNI) communications, CR-365-01, is about to be replaced with the new SIGINT Technical Information (STI) policy (ISS-155-06). The STI policy, reflecting the changing reality of the digital world, was designed to be more flexible than its predecessor and will go into effect on Monday, 18 September.

# (U) DNI Policy Overtaken by Events 

(U//FOUO) Although the DNI policy met the needs of its time when it first appeared, it has been overtaken by the steady stream of developments in the world of electronics and telecommunications. In light of this, Information Sharing Services' Policy Division chose to create an entirely new replacement rather than adding more bulk to the already hefty DNI policy. The new STI policy is far less complicated and about one-sixth as long as the one it replaces.
(U//FOUO) The most immediately noticeable difference between STI and its predecessor is the change from "DNI communications" to "SIGINT Technical Information." This is no mere verbal sleight of hand; it serves two purposes. First, it provides more latitude to reporters concerning what they can report; the DNI description was sometimes too narrow to fit many potential telecommunications topics. A secondary benefit is a clarification as to exactly what "DNI" means - there should be no more confusing it with the position of the Director of National Intelligence.

## (U) Streamlining the Reporting Process

(U) The STI policy is designed to streamline and simplify the reporting process and to allow reporting offices the discretion to disseminate STI to customers as most appropriate, within the constraints required by the policy. For example,

- Instead of four types of DNI reporting, STI divides information into only two categories;
- Under DNI reporting most information was ORCON, but with STI, much less information should need to be ORCON;
- Reporting vehicles can be determined by the reporting office, not mandated by the type of information;
- STI will not be constrained by the old policy's "do not report" restrictions.


## (U) Freedom Requires Responsibility

(U) The new policy also gives each reporting office the freedom to choose the appropriate vehicle for its specific situation, but along with this freedom comes responsibility. Reporting offices can determine what and how they report, but they must be able to justify their decisions.
(U) Of one thing we can be certain: change will be the only constant in our target landscape, and this new reporting policy gives us one way to remain flexible enough to respond to this reality.
