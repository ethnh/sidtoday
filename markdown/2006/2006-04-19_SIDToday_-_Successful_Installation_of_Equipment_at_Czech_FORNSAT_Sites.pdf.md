(S//SI) Successful Installation of Equipment at Czech FORNSAT Sites
FROM:
FAD's Europe Office (DP11)
Run Date: 04/19/2006
(S//SI) In February 2006, 04/19/2006 and 04/2007, of the Exploitation Applications Branch (S31232) in Cryptanalysis \& Exploitation Services (CES) installed SWORDFISH and NURSESHARK Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment (DCME) exploitation products at two Czech FORNSAT sites in or near Prague. Even prior to the creation of our formal SIGINT partnership, the Czech External Intelligence Service (UZSI) stated they were unable to process DCME bearers that employ 04/2007 and requested NSA assistance to process these signals.
(S//SI) Because giving UZSI this capability would benefit both partners, the decision was made during the June 2005 NSA/UZSI conference that it would be a top priority to help UZSI with processing these signals. Furthermore, and in a spirit of cross-organizational cooperation, CES volunteered to fund the TDY for installation and training. Once the equipment was installed, the Czechs immediately identified other DCME signals (e.g., 04/2007, 04/2008, 04/2009, 04/2010, 04/2011, 04/2012, and 04/2013, and the 04/2014, 04/2015 and 04/2016,
