(U) New 'SIGINT Mission Interface' Webpages

FROM
SIGINT Mission Interface for Facilities Services (S01)
Run Date: 02/28/2006
(U//FOUO) The new SIGINT Mission Interface (SMI) websites are up and running!! You might ask, "What is a SMI?" SMIs are new to the SIGINT mission. There are five SMI teams that represent SID and advocate our needs to the enabling organizations (Facilities Services, Associate Directorate for Education and Training, Information Technology Directorate, Security, and Human Resources).
(U//FOUO) With one click from the S01SMI homepage, you can reach our individual SMI websites. While the individual teams are small, they are dedicated to their craft and to solving the challenges that arise. They are there for you and to help support SID's continued mission success.
(U//FOUO) Take a look through the individual SMI web pages for more detailed information. The SMI teams look forward to hearing from you!
