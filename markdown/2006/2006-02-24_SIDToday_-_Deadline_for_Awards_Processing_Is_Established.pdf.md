(U) Deadline for Awards Processing Is Established

FROM:
Human Resource Service Center for SID (MD6)
Run Date: 02/24/2006
(U) Managers: please forward awards notifications to MD6 by the second Wednesday of the pay period.
(U) It's that time again - recognition is in the air! Now that the awards money has been distributed to all organizations, managers will be delivering awards notifications to their prospective Program Managers in HR (Human Resources). These notifications need to be delivered to MD6 by the 2nd Wednesday of each payroll period to allow sufficient time for processing.
(U) This gives HR a 2-day window to verify awards and get them into Peoplesoft (Concerto), and gives managers time to give their employees proper notification before the pay period ends.
(U) Due to automation enhancements to Peoplesoft (Concerto), employees now receive an SF50 notification via email every other Monday for any personnel action entered into the system in a given payroll period. This has resulted in some awkward situations in the past where awards were entered into the system and the employees received an SF-50 before management in their organization was able to properly acknowledge the recognition, either personally or with an awards ceremony. The timeline also is critical in situations where recognition comes from outside the employee's parent organization.
(U) In order to avoid this, we have established a biweekly deadline that permits enough time to get the actions into the system before the end of the payroll period, as well as allowing managers at least a few days to inform their employees before the SF-50 notification of the award goes out to the employee.
(U) Here are some major points on the process:

- Deadline for delivering awards to MD6 is 2nd Wednesday of each payroll period.
- Program Managers are the primary Point of Contact for awards. When considering recognition for your people as individuals or in a group, consult your Program Manager in HR, who can help you coordinate the process.
- Program Managers are listed on the MD6 "about us" webpage .
