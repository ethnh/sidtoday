(S//SI) NSAers pitch in to help maintain security during the World Cup tournament.
(U) A month of displaying good German hospitality and World Cup fever culminated with Italy winning the soccer championship on penalty kicks, 5-3 over France. As millions of people streamed into Germany from all points on the globe, a frenzied environment existed from 9 June, when Germany vs. Costa Rica kicked off the first game in Munich, through the final game on 9 July.

(U) After an opening game 4-2 victory for the host nation, the entire country took on a level of intoxication usually only brought on by Ma√ües (liters) of German beer. Alas, the US team managed only a tie and two losses, sending them home early in the tournament.
(S//SI) BND-2, the SIGINT arm of the German Foreign Intelligence Service, went on 24/7 manning in support of the games. SUSLAG also provided extended-hours support, ensuring the office was manned prior to and during most matches. Although relatively quiet and peaceful with no terrorist events during the games, the watchful resources of NSA, BND, as well as SISECT (SIGINT Seniors Europe CT) nations and other partners remained vigilant.
(S//SI) NSA also provided TDY support to Berlin Station prior to and during the entire tournament. This not only assisted the Station in its duties to ensure the safety of US personnel in Germany and as the focal point for the US Intelligence Community in support to the German Government during the games, but also ended up providing outstanding SIGINT support for other ongoing Station activities.
(U) The host country, Germany, managed to take third place overall, with a strong 3-1 victory over Portugal. Soccer fans will now wait for the run up to the next World Cup, hosted by South Africa in 2010.
