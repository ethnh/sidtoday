(TS//SI//REL) Collaboration Tool Is Used to Set Up Collection at Distant Site

(TS//SI//REL) A remote-access tool was used recently by SIGINTers in Maryland to set up collection at a site halfway around the world. To be specific, people working in the Special Collection Service (SCS) Training and Career Development Division (TCDD) used NetMeeting, a real-time collaboration tool, to help SCS Phnom Penh to search and map an emitter of great interest to the site. When SCS Phnom Penh's sole staffer requested assistance in mapping an SS7 signal, no one was available for TDY, thus the NetMeeting tool was used to accomplish the site's request.
(TS//SI//REL) NetMeeting allows a remote operator to access the entire site desktop environment as if he were sitting at site. Using this tool, TCDD mapped six signals in the VENTURER SS7 analysis tool, then installed the SS7 maps into the LIGHTSWITCH DNR processing platform. The remote operator then tweaked and monitored LIGHTSWITCH to assure proper and optimal processing of these signals.
(TS//SI//REL) An SCS Virtual Site linguist then produced gists from two of the just-mapped signals and found information regarding the escalating conflict on the Laotian-Cambodian border. SCS Bangkok produced a First Instance Report (FIR) based on those gists that same day, completing the circle. TCDD continued to map the remaining signals and, by the end of the week, a total of four FIRs had been produced from this link.
(TS//SI//REL) This is an outstanding example of how SCS has become increasingly "netcentric," using technology to bring together the expertise and knowledge of its worldwide resources to produce high-impact intelligence.
