(U//FOUO) Governing Data Flow: A Collaborative Solution
FROM: Janice Strauss, CSRC Office of Targeting and Mission Management (S3C3), and

(U//FOUO) Delivering SIGINT data to its intended customer is a complex task that requires the joint efforts of ITD (Information Technology Directorate) and SID. Personnel in the ITD's Global IT Operations Center (X23) and Global Enterprise Command Center (X22) and SID's Targeting and Mission Management (S3C3) collaborate on establishing and monitoring the flow of SIGINT data across the IT infrastructure and jointly seek solutions when obstacles threaten to delay or halt this flow.
(U//FOUO) This partnership was strengthened in the fall of 2005, when the SID/ITD Transition Tiger Team on Data Flow recommended that a joint ITD-SID Data Flow Governance Board be created with the overall responsibility for the health and welfare of current and future data flow procedures, functions and methodologies. The Directors of IT and SIGINT identified the Chiefs of IT Operations (X2) and the Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC/S3C), respectively, as their Directorate leads for Data Flow and charged them with joint stewardship of mission data flow.
(U//FOUO) The Data Flow Governance Board's principal charge is to address issues that are difficult to resolve at lower levels. Data Flow Governance will be carried out through standard business practices within the current operating structure, using previously established authorities and existing resources. Whenever possible, the Board will conduct business via staffs that are already in place; however, working groups and other temporary bodies will be formed as needed to address specific issues and initiatives.
(U//FOUO) ITD and SID are now teaming at the highest levels to handle corporate data flow concerns as expediently as possible. The result is coordinated, efficient data flow management that meets the needs of consumers of SIGINT data.
