(U//FOUO) Where to Go for Foreign Affairs Information -- All In One Place

FROM:
FAD's SID Mission Support Office (DP13)
Run Date: 02/14/2006
(U//FOUO) Foreign affairs-related information is being stored in the new FAKS (Foreign Affairs Knowledge System) database.
(U//FOUO) On 12 December, DP1 (the Foreign Affairs Directorate's SIGINT Operations Group) held a town meeting to discuss the newest version of the Foreign Affairs Knowledge System (FAKS), an important capability that will capture in a single space on the desktop all key information related to NSA's foreign relations program.
(U//FOUO) One of the most exciting features of FAKS V1.3 is the ability of the publisher to bulkupload documents and relevant e-mail, so we can expect to see a much more robustly populated system in early 2006! For consistency, V1.3 presents a built-in public taxonomy, while also allowing each account publisher to tailor a suitable private taxonomy.
(U//FOUO) Anyone on NSANet can, without an account, access the public documents in FAKS (including POC information for each foreign partnership) via the FAD homepage . For more information, to request an account, or to request training, please contact www.fao.org. The energetic exchange at the town meeting reflects the commitment of FAD leadership and DP1 personnel to making FAKS the answer to all of your foreign affairs questions.
