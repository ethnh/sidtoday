(U) The Presentation:
(U) Come and learn about the difference between Islam and Islamism, how Salafism helped shape UBL's political and religious beliefs, how different it is from mainstream Islam and how it relates to Wahhabism (a version of Islam also associated with UBL). The briefing will also walk you through UBL's journey from Saudi Arabia to Afghanistan, highlighting:

- the reasons why the Saudi royal regime revoked his citizenship, and
- why Bin Laden was willing to abandon his wealth and leave for Pakistan, the Sudan and ultimately reside in Afghanistan, establishing a strong relationship with the Taliban regime.
(U) A segment of the briefing will also focus on Arabic cultural awareness, comparing and contrasting the dynamics of the Arabic and Western work environments. What dynamics come into play and how do they dictate people's daily interaction with each other? You will receive helpful tips on what to do and what not to do within the Arabic culture, in your effort to blend in and adapt, as a Westerner. Finally, will explore male-female relationships in the Arab World. What kind of expectations does the Arabic culture put on the Arab female and what kind of influence do parents have in their children's life, even as independent adults?
