(C) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce the SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) Conference, now incorporating the Signals Analysis and Development Conference. This annual event provides the opportunity for SIGDEV experts from across the 5Eyes Community to share discovery efforts and network with colleagues to learn about the latest tools and techniques. As always, we'll be looking to identify the next steps needed to improve our worldwide collaboration efforts.
(TS//SI) The theme for the 2006 SIGINT Development Conference is "Collaboration: Key to NetCentric Discovery." NSA's Strategic Vision, Mission, and Goals of transforming the USSS into a self-synchronizing, net-centric enterprise that provides vital information to the nation in order to achieve information superiority for America and its allies requires continuous, active, integrated (interconnected) SIGINT Development discovery activities across the Enterprise. This is accomplished by quickly and effectively addressing SIGINT mission gaps, improving SIGINT Information Management by governing NSA's Metadata Strategy, mapping communications networks, and establishing policy, guidance, and training for SIGINT Development activities throughout the Enterprise.
(U//FOUO) The conference will begin at 0900 on 5 June in the Canine Suite with opening remarks by DIRNSA, followed by a keynote address by Mr. Michael Wertheimer, Assistant Deputy Director for National Intelligence and Chief Technology Officer for Analysis. The keynote address will be followed by a joint presentation by SIGDEV leaders from NSA, DSD, CSE, GCHQ and GCSB. All sessions will be held at the TS//SI level, with some presentations at TS//SI//TK.
(U//FOUO) Conference registration begins on 24 April 2006. We are currently accepting abstracts through 14 April 2006. Workshops this year will focus on discussions rather than PowerPoint presentations. We will also consider presentation topics outside of the main threads, scheduling them as sidebar sessions throughout the week. The major threads for the conference are:

- SIGINT Development Support to Tactical Level Operations o Travel Tracking/Follow the People
- Emerging Technologies: Current Exploitation to Future Investments - An Innovative Target Technology Trends Approach
- Using Network Metadata
- SIGINT Development in the Distributed, Metadata-Enabled SIGINT System of the Future - Persona Analysis
- Net-Centric Signals Analysis \& Development
