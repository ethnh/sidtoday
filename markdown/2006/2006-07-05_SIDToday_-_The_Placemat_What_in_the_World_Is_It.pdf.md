(U) The Placemat: What in the World Is It?

(U) You've probably heard people talk about "the Placemat," but have you wondered what it is? The Placemat is the familiar term used to describe the US SIGINT System (USSS)
Strategy. The Placemat identifies SID's overall vision and mission and gives strategic direction to the SIGINT enterprise. It contains twelve goals under three headings: Mission (Ends), Capabilities (Ways), and Management (Means). Each goal is directly aligned with the NSA Strategic Plan as well as the DNI's National Intelligence Strategy. Since all goals fit on one page, it is termed "the Placemat."
(U) The strategic direction outlined in the Placemat extends through 2013. If we are going to reach these strategic goals, it is important to manage the steps that will take us there. This is done with the aid of an 18-month implementation plan, known as the Long Range Plan.
(U) The Long Range Plan is the framework around which key USSS projects and activities are tracked and reported. It also supports greater accountability for results, as it identifies goal, objective, milestone, and performance measure leads who are responsible for managing each activity and reporting progress to senior leadership each quarter. The SIGINT Director and senior leadership make decisions during this review on actions to be taken, resources to adjust, processes to be improved or milestones to be adjusted where progress is being impeded.
(U) Our Canadian partners at CSE first came up with the format and style for a strategic "placemat." We liked it so much that we shamelessly stole the idea and the nickname. There have been five iterations of the Placemat since the stand-up of SID in 2001.
(U) To learn more about the Placemat, type "go SID-Placemat" in your web browser and stay tuned for more SID today articles explaining each of the SID goals.
