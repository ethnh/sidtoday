(U//FOUO) Profile: Analytic Services and Technology (S24)
FROM:
Deputy Chief, Analytic Services and Technology (S24)
Run Date: 12/21/2006
(U//FOUO) Analysts at NSA have often wondered about the origin of traffic that seems to magically appear in their queues on a daily basis. But have you ever wondered where the host of essential tools used to analyze that traffic -- such as MAINWAY, PINWALE, FASCIA, and AGILITY (just to name a few) -- are maintained? Moreover, have you considered who is responsible for making non-SIGINT classified and open-source information (i.e., collateral) accessible to the Agency?

# (U) What We Do 

(S//REL) Analytic Services and Technology (AS\&T) is the home of these aforementioned products and services. Along with maintaining these systems you use every day, AS\&T also provides analysts with lots of other products and services, for instance:

- improved access to voice processing tools and services;
- access to key databases containing Digital Network Intelligence (DNI) data and metadata used in target development activities; and
- customized digital geographic data.

We continue to champion analysts' access to improved high-powered workstations with multiscreen monitors and associated capabilities throughout the Analysis and Production (A\&P) global workplace.

## (U) Who's Who in AS\&T

(U//FOUO) AS\&T, formerly S202, was recently re-designated as $\mathbf{S 2 4}$. There are three divisions in AS\&T:

1. Advanced Intelligence Research Services, (AIRS - S241), provides essential collateral intelligence information required by the A\&P global enterprise;
2. Analytic Technologies for the Enterprise (S242) provides and maintains integrated tools for analysts and;
3. Technology Management Services (S243) is responsible for analytic technology transition, insertion and support.

The daily efforts of the personnel in these three organizations provide the vital link between analysts and breaking technology through capability development, deployment, and continued support.
