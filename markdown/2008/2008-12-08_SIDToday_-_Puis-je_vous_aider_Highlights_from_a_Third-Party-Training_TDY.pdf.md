(S//SI//REL) NSAers help train French partners in expeditionary SIGINT. (Comment: "Puis-je vous aider?" is French for "May I help you?")
(S//SI//REL) Our Coalition partners in Afghanistan are increasingly important to the success of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) -- in both the combat and SIGINT realms. As we deepen our relationships with several key partners, NSA will provide analytic training to help them improve SIGINT support to their operational forces.

(S//SI//REL) For that reason, an NSA team of eight ${ }^{1}$ recently traveled to the training facility of the $54{ }^{\mathrm{e}}$ Regiment de Transmissions ${ }^{2}$ in France. While there, they trained deploying SIGINTers from the French Army, Navy, and Air Force on NSA's Expeditionary SIGINT process. The primary goal was to show them our analytic techniques and methods. Additionally, there was an open exchange and sharing of information on both sides. The training was very well received, and the U.S. contingent came away impressed by the capabilities of the 54th Signals' SIGINT team, as well.
(TS//SI//REL) During the 15-17 October visit, the NSA team gave the French SIGINTers a crash course in exploiting metadata from GSM, Thuraya, VHF/UHF, and High Powered Cordless Phones (HPCP); call chaining and SIGINT Support Package development; and the tactical communications environment in Afghanistan. The students learned about the capabilities and value of CENTER ICE ${ }^{3}$, and were briefed on the SIGINT relationships and how they can be used to get help and information from Coalition partners.
(S//SI//REL) Surprisingly, the French allowed non-secure cell phones in their training facility, as long as they were turned off. The training was conducted entirely in English. All students had at least some capability in the language, and there were two translators to assist when needed. The trainers emphasized how we enable and empower junior enlisted personnel to analyze SIGINT metadata to provide targeting support to commanders in theater. They stressed that building a relationship with and earning the trust of the customer (brigade and battalion commanders) is critical to our success. The team also provided a brief description of RT-RG ${ }^{4}$, which will be available to the French via a Third-Party RT-RG capability in 2009.
(S//SI//REL) The French commanders asked how we obtain qualified linguists for the Afghanistan mission, sharing a concern common to all Coalition partners. They also were impressed that we hire retired military personnel to retain their expertise within the SIGINT system.
(C//REL) Despite being on a military installation, the NSA team was treated to French hospitality and cuisine. The regimental dining hall served mussels at lunch and had wine available with the meals (in containers similar to our soda dispensers). On the final evening of their visit, the
Commander of the 54th Regiment and his wife hosted the Americans for dinner at a restaurant in Old Haguenau city.

(U) Notes:
${ }^{1}$ (U//FOUO) Team members included personnel from the Meade Operations Center, Foreign Affairs Directorate, Army Technical Control and Analysis Element, and National Security Operations Center.
${ }^{2}$ (U//FOUO) The 54th Signals Regiment is responsible for both SIGINT and Electronic Warfare.
${ }^{3}$ (S//SI//REL) CENTER ICE is a system driven by the Foreign Affairs Directorate and supported by the SIGINT Senior nations to allow information flow and collaboration between 14 countries. It addresses the long-standing problem of secure, tactical communications between partners in a battlefield environment. (See background article.)
${ }^{4}$ (C//SI//REL) RT-RG = Real-Time Regional Gateway, an NSA program to provide troops on the front lines near-real-time access to valuable SIGINT data. It was previously known as RT10 (see background article).
