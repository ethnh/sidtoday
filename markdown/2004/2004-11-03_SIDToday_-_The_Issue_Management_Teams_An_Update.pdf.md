The seven new, full-time IMTs are staffed and at work. (S//SI)
(S//SI) In July we told you that SID had made changes to the Issue Management Teams (IMTs), with the number of teams reduced from 14 to 7. (See IMT Changes: Fewer, All Full-Time .) So what's been happening since then?

- Jeanne Zimmer and STEP (SID) are now acting as advisers and helping coordinate the IMTs.
- All of the IMTs are now staffed and spaces have been found where each team can be seated together.
- Late last month, all 21 IMT members met in the first-ever IMT Council meeting; another is planned for this week.
- An IMT Concept of Operations (CONOP) is being finalized in collaboration with the SID Deputy Directorates (i.e. S1, S2, and S3).
- The Iraq and Near East/South Asia IMTs coordinate the DIRNSA's weekly Iraq Campaign updates, which include on-line participation by NSA/CSS representatives across the entire extended enterprise.
- IMTs also conduct a weekly Campaign update and strategy meeting with the SIGINT Director and the SID leadership team.
- The Combating Proliferation IMT has worked to optimize SIGINT on potential terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
- The IMTs are providing input to issues such as strategic risk assessments and the Joint Quarterly Readiness Review (JQRR).
(U//FOUO) Stay tuned for future updates on the IMTs. For more information, see the updated IMT webpage .
