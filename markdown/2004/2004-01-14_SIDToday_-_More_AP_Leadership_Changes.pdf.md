SID/Deputy Director for Analysis and Production (S2)
(C) I am pleased to announce what I hope will be the last large-scale changes in senior leadership positions within A\&P:

- 100th of Staff , following
who did a fantastic job filling in after the reassignment of Regina Hambleton in September. 100th brings in-depth knowledge of people issues and mechanisms from her previous role as Chief of Deployment Services, a position we will advertise.
- Mary Robidoux is the new Deputy Chief, Production Services (S21), which has been vacant since 100th of went to Menwith Hill last spring. Mary is one of NSA's best program managers - she will be able to influence the many development and acquisition activities that are so vital to us.
- 100th of replaces Mary as Program Manager for Rebuilding Analysis 100th was Mary's deputy and provides much-need continuity for this complex set of activities.
- Jon Darby , who had been Acting Chief of the Ops Staff, moves to the Office of Proliferation and Arms Control (S2G). He will be Acting Chief of that organization effective 15 January, when 100th departs for an expected absence of about two months. I anticipate that 100th and John will consitute the leadership team in OPAC for the forseeable future. They are fortunate to have as a partner 100th of , full-time IMT for Proliferation .
- 10th of , a division chief in the Field Operations organization at SCS, assumes duties as Chief of Ops Staff effective 20 January. 10th has deep roots within A\&P and brings valuable experience from her service at SCS. Jon did a superb job building on the small but high quality staff, so 10th inherits a team that is rapidly becoming exactly what I hoped it would be.
- 10th of is Acting Chief of Planning, Architecture, and Requirements (S21S), effective 9 January, replacing Dennis Barnabe, who will be moving to the Enterprise Systems Engineering organization (a win-win situation for us). 10th will report to Menwith Hill Station this summer as Deputy Chief, Mission Engineering -- we are fortunate to have her to carry the load in the interim while we advertise the position.
(C) As a reminder, we are advertising for the Chief, International Crime and Narcotics (S2F); Chief, GEOCell (S2L); and Deputy Chief, Office of Russia (S2H).
