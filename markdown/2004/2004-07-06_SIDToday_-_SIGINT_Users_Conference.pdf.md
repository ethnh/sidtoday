# (U) SIGINT Users' Conference 

FROM:
Information Needs and Outcomes (S1111)
Run Date: 07/06/2004
(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Users' Conference, hosted by DIA, NSA, and SIGINT Requirements Validation and Evaluation Subcommittee (SIRVES), will be held during the week 19-23 July 2004 at the FANX II facility of the National Cryptologic School. The conference will educate SIGINT collection managers from throughout the Intelligence Community regarding how the SIGINT system operates, and how it reacts to SIGINT needs levied upon it.
(U//FOUO) Specifically, attendees will learn about the processes, resources, tools, workflow etc. that are brought to bear, from understanding the customer's needs, through to the SIGINT response in terms of SIGINT production. The focus will primarily be on enhancing the utility of SIGINT by bringing together the producers and users of SIGINT to discuss areas of concern, capabilities, limitations, and continuing needs.
(U//FOUO) The agenda will deal with the processes and challenges associated with producing SIGINT, and will offer opportunities to dialog with SID experts and the visiting collection managers. The conference attendees will gain much from this conference, to include:

- a raised awareness of legal, policy, and operational parameters within which the SIGINT system operates;
- a better understanding of the workflow used to accomplish SIGINT, and of the technology constraints we operate with, as well as the new technology we can leverage; and
- ideas about how to best shape Information Needs, so that NSA can better understand the customer's intent and desired outcome.
(S) The following tours, demos and training will be offered on a reservation basis:
- Tour of the Meade Operations Center (MOC). The MOC is one of the largest collection and reporting facilities in the United States Cryptologic System and performs many of the same functions as other U.S. intercept sites around the world. The Center utilizes state-of-the art remoting technology for airborne, terrestrial, and spaceborne collection and reporting in response to national and tactical intelligence requirements.
- A demonstration of the Information Needs (IN) Tool, which scans the text of reports and suggests a list of INs for the reporter to consider, based on keyword patterns found in the text. This can considerably speed up the process of identifying INs to cite, and increase the number of relevant INs cited on reports.
- National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) Training . This hands-on tool training session on the NSRP National Customer Interface client application is intended for individuals who will create or edit Information Needs to be levied on NSA, or who support SIGINT customers in doing so.
