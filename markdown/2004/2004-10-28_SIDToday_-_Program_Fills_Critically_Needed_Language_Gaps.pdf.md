(U//FOUO) Program Fills 'Critically Needed Language' Gaps

(U//FOUO) What's one way NSA is "building the bench" of tomorrow's cryptologic language analysts? - via the Language Enhancement Program (LEP), launched in January 04 by the National Cryptologic School (NCS), the Serior Language Authority (SLA), and Human Resources (HR). The LEP is an intensive global language training program which takes new hires with level 2/2 skills (limited working proficiency) in a commonly taught language such as French and crosstrains them to a level $3 / 3$ (general professional proficiency) in a critically needed, lesscommonly-taught language like Arabic. It is loosely modeled on the successful Russian 15A program of the 1980s.
(U//FOUO) The LEP also enables personnel who already have some knowledge of a critically needed language to enhance their skills to a level 3/3. Participants will be required to meet specified level 2 and level 3 milestones. Depending on the language and the skill level of the participant, the program could take up to three years to complete.
(U//FOUO) The NCS and SID have co-sponsored the refit of three floors of (referred to as the Language Learning Center) to house both this effort and other training programs related to the DIRNSA-required 3/3 language level. This unclassified facility houses two state-of-the-art language learning laboratories, as well as a 21st century multimedia language resource center. All classrooms are fitted with smart boards and laptop computers. The second and third floors of the building have been completed and are in use. The NCS is staffing the effort with teachers from the Defense Language Institute and from the local area.
(U//FOUO) To meet the FY04 hiring goal, the SLA, the NCS, HR, and Security launched an intensive recruiting and hiring effort in February 2004. The overall FY04 hiring goal of 60 LEP participants was met. Classes this October began cross-training participants into Arabic, Chinese, Persian, and Korean. There are also enhancement classes in these languages. The LEP will eventually train participants in Pashto and Turkish as well.
(U//FOUO) The FY05 Hiring Goal for LEP is an additional 60 participants. In FY05 LEP will also include native or heritage speakers of Chinese and Korean who need to improve their English skills. The English LEP, or E-LEP, hiring goal for FY05 is at least ten participants.
(U//FOUO) Please note that although the connection of the $\square$ facility with NSA and its employees is U//FOUO, it is highly sensitive information. All are asked to assist in keeping this a low-profile facility with no overt connection to NSA. All Agency personnel are asked to remove their badges while visiting the facility. In addition, the $\square$ facility is referred to as the "Language Learning Center" in an unclassified environment.
