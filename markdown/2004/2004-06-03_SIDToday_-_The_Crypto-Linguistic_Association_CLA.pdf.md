(U//FOUO) Created in 1965 by NSA's Hall of Honor recipient Dr. Sydney Jaffe, the Crypto-Linguistic Association (CLA) is the only NSA-based learned organization that supports the continuing development and advancement of Agency language analysts, and engages its members in language-related activities. These activities include:

- a speaker series ,
- an annual banquet with a nationally recognized speaker,
- an ever-growing foreign film and new books on tape lending library,
- an annual book swap, and
- a foreign language film festival .
(U//FOUO) This year's festival included films in Arabic, Chinese, Danish, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Persian/Farsi, and Spanish (Cuban). This year the CLA also started foreign language conversation groups in Arabic, Chinese, French, Persian, and Spanish, and more are on the way.
(U//FOUO) Presentations in our speaker series have featured topics of interest driven by our members. These include:
- Graphic Language Cryptanalysis in the Study of Ancient Greek Inscriptions,
- Certificate in Translation Program,
- On Being Multilingual, and
- Navaho Code Talkers.
(U//FOUO) CLA presents two annual longtime career awards : the prestigious Sydney Jaffe Award for civilians and the CAPT Joseph Rochefort Award for military personnel. CLA also launched two new awards starting in 2004: the Norman Wild Mid-Career Award for civilians and Colonel Alva B. Lasswell Mid-Career Award for military personnel. All of these awards honor language professionals whose outstanding mission accomplishments reflect the tradition of leadership, ingenuity, and scholarship exemplified by their namesakes.
