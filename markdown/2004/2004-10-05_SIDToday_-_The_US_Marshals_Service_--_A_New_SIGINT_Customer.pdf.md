(C) The U.S. Marshals Service -- A New SIGINT Customer

FROM:
Account Manager for the U.S. Marshals Service (S112)
Run Date: 10/05/2004
(C) The U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) often brings to mind lawmen hunting down fugitives in the Old West. While fugitive apprehension remains one of its core missions, USMS responsibilities and operations now include support to National Special Security Events (NSSEs)* and protection of the U.S. jurisprudence system. Like special forces of the justice system, they provide force protection to U.S. law enforcement agencies themselves. The scope of their foreign mission is quickly expanding in support of the Global War on Terrorism and homeland security, and NSA is teaming with them in a relationship that promises mutual benefits.

# Who Are the Marshals? 

(C) USMS, like DEA and FBI, is a component of the Department of Justice and is operationally dispersed across the country and around the globe. To counter the growing worldwide dimension of the threats, USMS is working hard to establish more offices abroad and collaborate more closely with foreign law enforcement, including Interpol and European Union authorities.
(C) The Marshals' unique expertise lies in pinpointing the location of fugitives. After apprehension, they typically render the bad guys quickly to other law enforcement authorities. We rarely see U.S. Marshals on the podium announcing a major arrest-they are one organization that prefers not to take the credit in public. (But just ask them off-stage, and they will give you the real scoop.) Their Electronic Surveillance Unit (ESU) functions like an intelligence operations team to stealthily monitor the communications and movements of fugitives of U.S. justice. This team had provided technical assistance in the efforts to capture the elusive DC area sniper in the Fall of 2002.
(C) During major events, including trials of notorious fugitives, the Marshals provide force protection and coordinate closely with other law enforcement agencies. In this respect, the ESU has been preparing for upcoming terrorist trials in Northern Virginia by surveilling and photographing the court area from the air, conducting ground inspections, and analyzing lead information to determine potential threat sources, safe routes, and defensive positions.

## How Does SID Interact with the Marshals?

(C//SI) SID's relationship with USMS was formalized in a February 2004 Memorandum of Understanding. The potential benefit of SIGINT support for the apprehension of foreign fugitives is obvious, particularly as USMS expands its presence and activities abroad. However, both NSA and USMS can also gain much by exchanging expertise in areas such as geolocational and social network analysis, contact chaining, and technical/collection tools. The fact that Marshals stay out of the public limelight and courtrooms helps reduce fears of jeopardizing SIGINT equities -- the new MOU establishes further procedures for handling SIGINT and acting on lead information that is based on foreign intelligence and counterintelligence.
(C//SI) The ESU recently completed a new SCIF with assistance from NSA's Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) and soon will be plugged into the Intelligence Community over the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS). As their mission grows, the Marshals are also realizing the potential benefits of further IAD products and services to secure their communications and operations.
(C//SI) For its part, SID touches this law enforcement partner through its representative to the Department of Justice and further manages the relationship with a Customer Account Manager and Senior Executive Account Manager. This S1 team facilitates USMS exchanges with S2 and S3 elements, and the Office of General Counsel is an integral member of this partnership. As with all law enforcement entities, new formal SIGINT requirements are submitted through the FBI.
SID's relationship with USMS is just getting off the ground, and NSA is sure to enjoy many success stories as our partnership grows.
