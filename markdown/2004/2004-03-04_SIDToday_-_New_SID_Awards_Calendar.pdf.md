FROM: SID People Office (S01P)
(U//FOUO) Are you looking for ways to rejuvenate and motivate your employees? Rewards can be used either as incentives or recognition. To stimulate supervisors and managers to think about the variety of rewards available and the necessity of recognizing people for a job well done, a new section, "Award Aids," is now available on the Workforce Performance Executive Homepage. In it you will find the SIGINT Directorate awards calendar.
(U//FOUO) This "one-stop-shop" working aid offers links to a large range of awards -- from the spontaneous gesture of praise to formal and non-formal traditional award programs -- and shows the appropriate timeframe.
(U//FOUO) If you have any good suggestions to further improve this working aid, please contact us.
