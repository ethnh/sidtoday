(U//FOUO) I recently had the opportunity to spend a day shadowing the SID Chief of Staff, Charles Berlin. The experience was great, and it allowed me a brief glimpse of the way our leadership is tackling the strategic issues facing the Agency.
(U//FOUO) In one day, we covered promotions, racial diversity, compensation reform, hiring decisions, the evolving situation in Iraq, congressional queries, the impact of a major water leak in one of the big four buildings, the question of how managers can better manage overtime to ensure that we have a well-rested and healthy work force, and a restructuring of the SID staff. According to Mr. Berlin, this was a "light" day.
(U//FOUO) We had meeting after meeting, with literally just minutes or seconds between most commitments. It was an incredibly hectic pace, and it was amazing to see how quickly and adeptly Mr. Berlin was able to shift gears. His executive assistant, Brenda Krasnodemski, was always there when we had a free moment, getting Mr. Berlin's decisions on a never ending list of actions. I learned that she makes every second of his time count!! His executive secretary, was also busy juggling meeting after meeting on Mr. Berlin's calendar. Even in such a face-paced and stressful environment, the three of them manage to maintain a sense of humor and they all bent over backwards to make me feel welcome.
(U//FOUO) Mr. Berlin also made it a priority to find time for the two of us to chat, one-on-one, and he was very willing to give me frank answers to my questions. He made the day extremely interactive, asking for my input and ideas on several of the decisions he was making.
(U//FOUO) The shadowing program brought a new dimension to the many issues that we often only read about. I highly recommend it!
