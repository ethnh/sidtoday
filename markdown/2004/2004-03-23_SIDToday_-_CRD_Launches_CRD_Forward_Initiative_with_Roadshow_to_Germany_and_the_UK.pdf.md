(U//FOUO) From 7 to 13 February 2004, members of the Customer Relationships Directorate leadership team took the CRD message on the road to the

- US European Command (USEUCOM) and NSA/CSS Europe (NCEUR) at Stuttgart,
- the European Technical Center (ETC) in Wiesbaden,
- the Joint Analysis Center (JAC) at Molesworth, and the
- Special U.S. Liaison Office London (SUSLOL) with a video teleconference (VTC) to SUSLOL-Cheltenham.

Mr. Carl L. Johnson, Assistant Deputy Director for CRD, led the group.
(S//SI) The focus of the trip was to clearly define CRD missions and programs for NSA field personnel who are performing "CRD Forward" functions. CRD pledged to collaborate better with field activities by jointly establishing processes, setting standards and better linking the field to CRD.
(S//SI) CRD's assessment of these visits should come as no surprise to anyone - SIGINT continues to be critical to our customers. We (NSA) are hitting the mark, but there is much improvement to be made by engaging the extended enterprise workforce and in developing creative ways to engage and understand our customers.
(S//SI) Both USEUCOM, as a customer, and NCEUR, as CRD's functional forward element, welcomed this message. An on-site explanation of how NSA Headquarters is executing Transformation 2.0 proved to be very beneficial to the audience. This trip helped to make real the philosophies of "SIGINT as a team sport" and "swimming upstream."
(S//SI) Major focus areas for CRD briefings included:

- the Customer Engagement Strategy (including soliciting support for reinvigorating Customer Support Plans),
- Database Access processes,
- Transformation 2.0 and Dissemination Initiatives, and
- Support to Military Customers and organizations.

Based on initial feedback from NSA personnel, the CRD message was much appreciated and well received.
(S//SI) At Stuttgart, Mr. William Crumm, Chief NCEUR , and 40 people from his staff attended the CRD briefings and discussions. His focus was on forward production, information sharing, database access, and soliciting more customer feedback. He also suggested that it would be helpful for DA (S3) to provide more information on new capabilities to those interfacing with the customer because knowledge of these capabilities would further refine EUCOM's Information Need requests. Mr. Crumm expressed his approval of "CRD rolling the message beyond the fence line to the worldwide enterprise."
(S//SI) Although the CRD team's focus was on updating NSA personnel, the team also took the opportunity to engage the USEUCOM customers, who were eager to listen and respond to the CRD message. LTG Sylvester, USA, USEUCOM Chief of Staff, applauded the effort, reinforced the need to communicate regularly, and concluded by declaring he had "zero complaints." He did ask that NSA "look hard at our intelligence priorities and requirements, and focus as you can."
Similarly, RADM Tallent, USN, USEUCOM Director of Operations, declared, "Without SIGINT, we'd be in the dark." All spoke very highly of the network of relationships used to focus SIGINT. They lauded the on-site services performed by NCEUR as well as the continued good relationship with DDAP (S2).
(S//SI) At ETC , Mr. Kevin Ford and his leadership team provided their organizational backdrop, and the CRD team focused on key issues for the ETC, Database Access and Partner Relationship Management (PRM). The ETC would benefit from Partner Profiles that would show the big picture relationship with that particular partner and would link ongoing activities at NSAW with mission being performed in the field. The ETC asked the CRD team to explore the S3 connection to CRM/PRM in order to develop business processes that link collection capabilities to customer outcomes.
(S//SI) At JAC Molesworth, the CRD team focused on those who are performing CSG-like functions as well as forward-deployed analysis. Those working in support of watch operations made the most of the information CRD presented on changes to exercise support and changes in CSG missions by preparing to change their own job descriptions.
(S//SI) In London, Mr. Chris Inglis, SUSLOL, hosted the CRD group for discussion with his staff and then attended a VTC with SUSLOL-Cheltenham to deliver the CRD message. After hearing the presentations and discussions, he declared that he "likes the vector CRD is taking. Clients should go to CRD first and should not have to go anywhere else!" He particularly applauded the Customer Response approach to Information Sharing through identifying the Five Threads to pull through the process with a "just do this" attitude.
(U//FOUO) CRD is now discussing follow-on actions to this very fruitful first tour in order to improve our CRD Forward program message before making the next major field visit. The CRD video and briefings given during this TDY can be accessed from the CRD homepage .
