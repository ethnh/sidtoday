# (U//FOUO) Integration of the IOTC into SID 

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director
Run Date: 10/04/2004
(S//SI//REL) SID has been working with the Information Operations Technology Center (IOTC) since its inception. Our collaboration reached a high point during 2002-2003 when we came together as "Team Meade" (including our Defensive Information Operations colleagues over in Information Assurance) to characterize the Iraqi Internet and then support electronic military actions against targets on that system.
(U//FOUO) As you've read in DIRaram-345: IOTC Mission Accomplished, we are now taking our relationship a step further -- integration. As of 1 October, the following major IOTC elements will become part of SID:

- CCG (Community Coordination Group) -- joining S15/Information Warfare Support Center
- AAG (Analysis and Assessments Group) -- joining S2K/SIGINT Support to Information Operations
- ATG (Advanced Technology Group) -- joining S32/Tailored Access Operations

To the IOTC workforce as it joins our ranks: we're delighted to have you on the SID team!
(U//FOUO) We've done a good job matching up IOTC functions within the three SID "bubbles" (i.e. S1, S2 and S3), but ultimate success will depend on continued horizontal coordination across the corporation to make sure that we "deliver" on Computer Network Operations-related requirements -- a shifting mix of intelligence, tools and access, depending on the situation. Our focus is on measurable success and we'll stay flexible as we work out the best processes to get the job done.
(U//FOUO) SID didn't get where it is today by sitting still. We have always used our existing knowledge to grapple with the tougher targets on the horizon and to anticipate new challenges beyond that. Please take the time to become familiar with our new business lines that come with integration and welcome the talented people from IOTC who are joining us.
