(S//SI) Did you know that collection of foreign communications satellites (FORNSAT) is the source of over 30 percent of NSA and U.S. Field reporting? How about the fact that 46 percent of arms proliferation reporting, 30 percent of counter narcotics reporting, and 29 percent of counterterrorism reporting originate from FORNSAT accesses?
(S//SI) Making all of this possible is the cooperation of our Second Party Partners - Great Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. To maintain this level of success the 5 -eyes FORNSAT community used to plan ahead and tackle the toughest challenges together at the Joint COMSAT Planning Review Board (JCPRB) and the COMSAT Planning Forum (CPF). These two planning bodies have now been combined into one--the COMSAT Advisory Board (CAB).
(S//SI) Focused on long-range planning that will ensure continued successes, the CAB is the first step toward establishing the Global Network Forum (GNF) which is to be inaugurated next month. The CAB will inform the GNF about issues specific to 5 -eyes FORNSAT programs, i.e. access planning, architecture \& engineering, and SIGINT development.
(S//SI) The premier meeting of the CAB, held on 6 and 7 May 2004 at NSA Headquarters, was chaired by Technical Director for FORNSAT. Attendance included delegations from NSA and all 2nd party FORNSAT partners. Following the opening remarks by Chief of Radio Frequency Operations, the participants dove right into challenging issues unique to FORNSAT:

- a 5-eyes division-of-effort to modernize the FORNSAT architecture,
- access and collection of mobile satellite services,
- development of automated survey tools, and
- advancement of the 5 -eyes environmental knowledge base.
(S//SI) Each topic was introduced with a short briefing. The participants actively engaged in discussion, sought consensus whenever necessary and made difficult decisions as one body. The format proved to be an excellent model to achieve the CAB goals of:
- increasing collaboration among FORNSAT partners,
- making decisions on issues affecting the FORNSAT community within the next 18 months, and
- coalescing FORNSAT's voice as one of the many accesses that make up the global network.
(S//SI) We would like to thank participants from the 2nd party organizations, Field Sites, and the following supporters at NSAW: Link Access Programs, Radio Frequency Operations, Cryptologic Exploitation Services, Office of Target Pursuit, and System Integration \& Operations. Noteworthy was the participation of the following Delegation Heads: National Security Agency (NSA), Graham Bird, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) , Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Defence Signals Directorate (DSD), and Chris Farrow, Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB).
