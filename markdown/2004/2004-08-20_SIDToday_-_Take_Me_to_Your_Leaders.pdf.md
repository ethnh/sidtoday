(U//FOUO) "It was really enlightening!" ... "I appreciated the level of candor." ... "What a busy day!" ... "It's good to gain a fresh perspective." ... These are phrases that have been collected from people who have participated in the Workforce Outreach program.
(U//FOUO) There are three different programs available to every SID employee: the Shadow program, the Walkabout program, and the What's On Your Mind program. Last week was red-letter, as our SID leaders had a calendar filled with engaging the workforce:

- A new-hire got to see the organization from new heights by spending the day with MG Quirk,
- a branch in S2H met with the SIGINT Director to discuss their concerns and excitement about the future of the SID mission, and
- SIGINT Deputy Director, Charlie Meals, went on a Walkabout in the Remote Operations Center at R\&E.
(U//FOUO) The Workforce Outreach program is currently accepting requests for participation. To submit your request scroll down to "Workforce Outreach" on the SID today homepage. All your options are right there, waiting for your click! Also, if you would like to read some reviews from those who have already participated, click on any of the following links:
