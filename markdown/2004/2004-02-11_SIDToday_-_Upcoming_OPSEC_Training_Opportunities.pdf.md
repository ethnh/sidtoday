SID OPSEC Program Manager
(U//FOUO) Hello again from the SID OPSEC world. By now everyone has heard of OPSEC in some shape or form and has even mastered the OPSEC 1301 course. We want to thank everyone involved for taking the time to complete this course and to those who provided their technical expertise and efforts where VuPort was concerned. We would also like to encourage you to continue to learn more about OPSEC.
(U//FOUO) On September 12, 2001, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz challenged each of us with the immediate need to protect sensitive information and the importance of both understanding and applying the process of OPSEC across the Department of Defense. His challenge to the workforce was to:

- Make OPSEC a priority.
- Integrate OPSEC into training and awareness programs.
- Ensure that force protection and operations planners are capable of recognizing the risks associated with compromising critical information and countermeasures needed to mitigate those risks.
- Continually assess your ability to apply appropriate OPSEC practices to your daily mission.


# (U//FOUO) Why is it important that we learn about OPSEC?? 

(U//FOUO) Operations Security is a tool that our adversaries believe in, and one that we as government employees need to understand and integrate into our daily routine. Our work is information, and not all of it is classified. We don't always realize how much we are giving away by our predictable behavior, casual conversations, routines and other Internet information. We must be careful of what we are revealing - failure to do so could provide our adversaries with the information they need to execute additional terrorist acts.
(U//FOUO) The Director of Signals Intelligence expects all civilian, military, and contractor personnel within the Signals Intelligence Directorate stationed at NSA or the field to integrate OPSEC into all daily SID activities. This applies also to support organizations whose activities impact SID operations.
