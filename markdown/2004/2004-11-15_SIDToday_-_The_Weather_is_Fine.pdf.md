New tool delivers global weather information in an easy-to-use format (S//SI)
(S//SI) After nearly a year of preparation, ArcIMS Weather is now operational. It is a tool that combines Special Weather Intelligence (SWI) reporting with ArcIMS technology to interpret and display real-time weather, from normally denied areas (i.e. not available through open sources), at the click of a mouse. ArcIMS Weather was developed by the combined efforts of the GIS Solutions Division (S2L2) and Regional Targets' Worldwide Weather Branch (S2A15).
(S//SI) With ArcIMS Weather, the warfighter, intelligence analyst, planner or decision-maker can view the target environment with unprecedented flexibility and responsiveness, and can make operational decisions based on the latest weather updates. The tool will also support a rapidly growing Intelligence Community and DOD demand for an operational, cost-effective method to access SWI by reaching out to 65,000 Intelligence and Defense Community personnel via INTELINK.
(S//SI) ArcIMS has an easy-to-use application interface. All the customer needs is Internet Explorer and a Java plug-in. (In future, the website will be viewable in multiple browsers and not require a Java plug-in.) Over half of the six million annual weather reports that S2A15 processes annually are available on ArcIMS Weather. The tool operates from a "live feed" with data constantly updating from the time that the user first accesses the webpage. Future upgrades to the website will provide archiving capabilities, as well.
(S//SI) The data is displayed in a stoplight format (red/green/yellow), with red indicating bad weather and green indicating good weather (based on aviation parameters). This format provides the customer with an overall quick assessment. Click on a dot and an attribute window is displayed with easy-to-read details. The "stoplight" represents a significant upgrade from the standard weather code. It reduces time spent looking for the data -- one click and you have your information. Previously, users needed to click 5-6 times and then use a "cheat sheet" to break down the code.
(U//FOUO) To get started, open Microsoft Internet Explorer and type in "go swi" (

). Then click on the link (near the top of the webpage) to the "point and click" display.
