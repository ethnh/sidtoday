(U//FOUO) The SIGINT System keeps track of its production metrics with an interface called "PLUS." For a given report, PLUS shows the collection sources, the offices that produced the report, case notations, etc. It also includes a customer feedback tool. When, in the aftermath of 9/11, the Agency found that it needed even better production metrics, Customer Gateway (S11) set about evaluating the situation.
(U//FOUO) They discovered that although PLUS was technically sound, it had suffered from a lack of investment in recent years and was long overdue for modernization. (Its underlying technology is over 10 years old and nearly all of its commercial components are obsolete and lack any form of support.)
(U//FOUO) In the last year or two, PLUS has been upgraded as much as possible to improve its data sharing, system interfaces, equipment and databases. However, a still-more-powerful tool is needed. As a result, plans are underway to acquire a new and improved "son of PLUS." This effort is called SIgint Reporting Metrics, or SIREM.
(U//FOUO) Customer Gateway and Cryptologic Mission Management (CMM - SDN9) got together and sent out a call for new requirements for SIREM in early December 2003. They got lots of input and talked with many users, and the requirements have been gathered and analyzed. As the next step, the project managers are checking out a commercial Business Intelligence tool called COGNOS, to see if it can do the job. Between now and July, COGNOS will be tested to see how well it meets the requirements; if it proves worthwhile, the tool will be deployed as PLUS version 6.0.
(U//FOUO) Further down the road, the SKYCAST database (against which PLUS queries are run) is due for modernization, and this should complete the drive to improve NSA's SIGINT production metrics. Customer Gateway technical leaders are excited about how these efforts are shaping up: they have enjoyed a very productive collaboration with CMM, the requirements were gathered speedily, and the piloting effort is proceeding well, leveraging other related investigations across SID (i.e. other Agency offices are also checking out COGNOS). With any luck, we are well on the way towards giving the Agency the metrics tools we need for the future.
(U//FOUO) If you have any questions about SIREM, please contact www.sigint.org, Technical Leader, Customer Gateway, at 0000000000000000 nsa.
