(U//FOUO) The National Intelligence Support Team (NIST)/Field Sustainment office, in conjunction with ITIS's Field IT and Desktop Implementation Branch, recently oversaw the fielding of a new NSANet suite of equipment for deployed NIST teams .
(U//FOUO) In keeping with NSA's migration to an NT environment, AS233 lead system administrator SSG Bryan Harte, USA approached AS233 and S1312 leadership in March of this year with a draft layout of a new NT architecture for NSA's NIST team. S1312 IT desk officers CTRC(SW) $\square$ USN, and CTR2 USN finalized equipment procurement in early November for equipment initially designated to be a test platform.
(S//SI) Responding to increased processing and multi-tasking requirements for NSA's team supporting CJTF-7 in Baghdad, AS23 system administrators rapidly shifted their focus from building a test bed system to building a functional suite for immediate deployment. Finalizing the system build in under one week, AS233 system administrators deployed to Baghdad on 24 November to begin the installation of the system.
(S) The mainframe of the equipment (pictured below) includes dual PowerEdge 2650 processors, a PowerVault disk array, and line conditioning UPS units. In addition to increased processing power in a stable environment, the system provides on-site Microsoft Exchange Server and user file hosting. Specially configured to fit inside two shock-mounted ruggedized containers, the system will ensure NSA's forward deployed personnel are provided state-of-the-art equipment in a tactical environment.

(S) To support increased multi-tasking, positions at CSG Baghdad were specially configured with increased video processing and dual flat panel monitors, allowing analysts simultaneous access to a variety of applications and data.

(U//FOUO) According to LtCol $\square$, "The Viking server is working flawlessly...we have stressed its capability and it has performed to the specified standards. We have had not one problem with the Server configuration. The new Dell OPTIPLEX GX260 desktop workstations are holding up extremely well - the Dell FS flat screen monitors are a big hit with the NSA VS targeting analysts - especially the dual screen workstations. I believe it is safe to say that analytical work productivity has increased by $20 \%$. CSG Baghdad is now the 'flagship' of the IFC to show
capabilities and briefings to VIPs and General Officers/Flag Officers off the dual flat screens. The Dell FS flat screen monitors have markedly reduced eye fatigue and 'screen burnout' for the young NSA VS analysts who sit on these workstation in excess of 16 hours a day...it does make a difference."
