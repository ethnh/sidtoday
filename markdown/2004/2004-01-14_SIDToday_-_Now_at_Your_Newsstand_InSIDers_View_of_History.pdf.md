(U) Now at Your Newsstand: InSIDer's View of History

(U//FOUO) SID today is beginning a new series, called "InSIDer's View of History" . In it, contributors will tell of experiences from their careers in which they were caught up in historical events. These might be stories from people who witnessed major incidents unfold; other times they may be less momentous in nature (such as a story about running into a VIP in an unexpected place). We hope that this series will become a permanent feature of the webpage.
(U//FOUO) Were you working shiftwork one night when you had to handle a brewing international crisis? Did you once brief a VIP on a critical piece of intelligence? Did you serve in the military and see an exceptional event take place? -- These are examples of potential stories. Many in SID must have interesting anecdotes along these lines. (Amusing stories would be very welcome!) We invite you to submit your story via our "submit an item" function on the right side of the SID today homepage .
(U//FOUO) To get the ball rolling, we have asked the SID senior leadership to think back on their long careers for such stories, and we expect to publish these in the coming weeks. Today's article from Charles Berlin is the first. Watch for future editions!
