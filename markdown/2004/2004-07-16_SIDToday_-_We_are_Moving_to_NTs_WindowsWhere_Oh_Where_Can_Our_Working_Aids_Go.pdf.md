(U//FOUO) Are you wondering what you are supposed to do with your SEMESTER working aids when you migrate away from SEMESTER and SANDTERM? Well, you can relax, because there are solutions available. As briefed by the Legacy Data Migration - Voice Task Team, Document Management System (DMS) and HOMEBASE eWorkSpace (eWS) are viable alternatives. DMS is preferred for handling file-based, non-fielded data and eWS for fielded data.
(U//FOUO) DMS is a document management and analytic knowledge sharing system. It provides users with DMS "My Files" repositories, which can be customized and personalized. In addition, DMS gives users access to large numbers of need-toknow documents for read and search purposes. Currently, there are approximately 50 organizational repositories available in DMS.
(U//FOUO) What do you need to do to get your working aids moved to DMS? Actually, moving the documents is the easy part. Organizing the documents is what requires the time and effort. So, that is what you need to start doing: each office should review the working aids they have and eliminate any that are unnecessary or no longer used. All documents that remain need to be categorized.
