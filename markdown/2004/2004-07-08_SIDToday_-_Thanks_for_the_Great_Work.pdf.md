(U) Thanks for the Great Work!
FROM: Charlie Meals
Signals Intelligence Deputy Director

(S//SI) We in the SIGINT world have grown accustomed to working at a ferocious operational tempo in recent years -- but even by the standard of post-9/11 activity, the last 10 days have been extremely demanding by any measure. World events such as the transition of power in Iraq, hunt for the al-Qa'ida terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and the NATO summit have added up to a real crunch time for SIGINTers.
(U//FOUO) In typical fashion, people in SID and the extended enterprise have worked long hours and put forth the extra effort needed to keep pace with operational demands. Everyone has pitched in to get the job done.
(U//FOUO) I want to say "thank you" to everyone who has been working especially hard this summer, and to tell you that your efforts are not going unappreciated. Military and political leaders value our SIGINT highly and recognize the strenuous efforts that have gone into collecting, producing, and disseminating it in a timely manner.
(U) The SIGINT workforce -- both for skill and dedication - is simply second to none! Keep up the good work.
