(TS//SI) U.S. forces apprehended one of the major facilitators of terrorist operations in Iraq, Abu Abdullah, on March 6th. SIGINT reporting played a vital role in the operation. Leading up to the capture, SIGINT reports were issued indicating that Abdullah planned to leave his base in Syria and travel to Iraq. Subsequent reports provided explicit details of a planned meeting between Abdullah and another terrorist at a restaurant in an Iraqi town near the Syrian border, to include the location, time and even the clothes that they would be wearing!
(TS//SI) When the terrorists showed up at the appointed time, U.S. forces were ready for them. The terrorists exited the restaurant and climbed into a van; as it made a U-turn to leave, the U.S. forces swooped in, made the capture, and got out. The terrorist has been positively identified as Abu Abdullah. In addition to planning terrorist attacks in Iraq, Abdullah is believed to be involved in extremist networks active throughout the Middle East.
(U) Congratulations to all those involved in this successful operation!
