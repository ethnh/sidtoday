(U//FOUO) Seminar: The Economic Espionage Threat to the U.S.
FROM: Marilyn Maines
Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 10/12/2004
(U//FOUO) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present a special Strategic Intelligence Issue seminar, "Economic Espionage Threat to the United States and NSA's Role" by Senior Special Agent Alexis Hatten, chief of the Economic Espionage Unit in the FBI's Counterintelligence Division, on Wednesday, 20 October, from 1330 to 1530 in Room 3S040. Advance registration is required - see the Brown Bag Series webpage for instructions.

# (U) Course Overview: 

(TS//SI) Economic espionage impacts the United States on many fronts. Not only has it cost the United States upwards of $\$ 200$ to $\$ 400$ billion in intellectual property, but espionage is one of the main methods used by foreign countries to modernize their defense industries. With the United States at the cutting edge of technology development, it is the primary target of foreign countries seeking to steal these technologies for their own gain. SIGINT can play a major role in assessing the extent of the problem and preventing the loss of intellectual property through providing indications of foreign targeting and collection against U.S. industries and governmental organizations, activities of front companies being used for this collection, and plans of foreign governments to use joint ventures with U.S. companies to acquire sensitive and/or proprietary information.
(S) This session is classified TS//SI//NF and will not be videotaped.
