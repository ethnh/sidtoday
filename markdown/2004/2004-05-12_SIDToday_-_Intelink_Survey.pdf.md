(U//FOUO) The Intelink Management Office (IMO) Information Management Directorate (IMD) is canvassing NSA SIGINT analysts on their use of Intelink as a source of information and research. The survey can be found on Intelink at the SIGINT analysts survey website (log into VPN before connecting). Anyone in SID with access to Intelink-TS is asked to take a few moments to answer the six questions. Essentially, we are asking you to tell us why you use Intelink, what resources you like and don't like, and where you think we can make improvements.
(U//FOUO) We really want to know your opinion so that we can make Intelink more beneficial to SIGINT analysts. Please take a few minutes to provide us with your candid comments. It is important for us to know what you think about Intelink and whether we are providing the resources and information that help you perform your official duties.
(U//FOUO) For those of you who have active Intelink accounts, but do not use Intelink in the normal course of your work, we want to know that too and, more importantly, why you don't. We cannot satisfy your needs if we are not aware of where we fall short of meeting them. Your comments are as important to us as are those from users who do depend upon Intelink to meet the challenges of their jobs.
(U//FOUO) If you do not have an Intelink account, but want to establish one, you should start here at the user info page .
(U//FOUO) The survey will terminate on 11 June 2004. Thank you for your participation.
