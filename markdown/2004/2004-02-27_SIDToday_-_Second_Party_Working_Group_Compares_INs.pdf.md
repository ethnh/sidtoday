(C) NSA and its Second Party partners are making great strides in making our systems interoperable. The next step, as set forth in the 5-Eyes Business Vision, is for the Second Parties to capitalize on opportunities to act together against global threats as they emerge. To be successful, we must share Intelligence Needs (INs) to the greatest extent possible within the Second Party community. This sharing supports both the strategic goals of satisfying client needs and creating a "default to share" approach in our relationships.
(C) With this background, Customer Gateway (S11) recently brought together representatives of each of the Second Party nations to form a Second Party INs Working Group. They reviewed a number of aspects of information needs processes, including the activities of the "Customer INs and Response" Integrated Product Team (IPT), which is reexamining how NSA gathers, manages, and responds to the needs of our customers. The similarities and differences between each of the partners and their related processes led to discussion that focused on the sharing of priorities and mission - rather than individual - INs.
(C) Key outcomes of the meeting were agreements that:

1. Sharing INs at the highest level only is desirable at this time.
2. The process of sharing INs and closing intelligence gaps should be agreed upon before significant investment is made in technology.
3. A common IN structure is necessary.
4. Individual bilateral commitments to share INs on specific topics would be honored as we progress toward creating a space each Second Party can populate with high-priority INs.
5. The working group will brief the status of their work at the Second Party Customer Service Conference in April.
