(U//FOUO) Today marks SID today 's first anniversary. To commemorate the occasion, we have mined our SID today archives for some of the more memorable quotes that have appeared over the last year. A retrospective, of sorts. Half will appear today, and the rest tomorrow. Also, we'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has contributed to SID today, whether through submitting an article, providing feedback, or simply reading the webpage on a regular basis. We look forward to an even better Year Two!

(U//FOUO) Soon there will be a press report announcing my appointment as the FBI's Director of Intelligence. I assume that post in May as an FBI employee.

(U) "...I believe that the US National Security Agency (NSA) is the most powerful espionage agency and that it rules the world at the moment, because it is capable of achieving total surveillance of our planet and implementing a strategy of total espionage."

(U) Yesterday, Lt Gen Hayden announced the selection of Major General Richard Quirk III, USA, as the new Signals Intelligence Director. Charlie Meals, currently Chief of the SID Customer Relationships Directorate, will serve as MG Quirk's deputy.

(TS//SI) At a time when much of the workforce is focused on enabling a successful outcome for coalition forces in Iraq, a small team of experts is developing the post-war Iraq plan. As complex and demanding as the combat environment will be, the transition to peace; the elimination of Iraq's ability to threaten the U.S. and its allies; and the restoration of a civil government will likely be the longest and potentially most demanding engagement in this campaign.

(S) ...we must ensure that we sustain the right focus on Iraq and the issues attendant to that challenge. The success that was achieved at a cost to so many could be lost if we let our vigilance slip during this crucial period. I urge my leadership team, the Issue Managers, the
Phase IV planning team and the Functional Leads to redouble their efforts to maintain the necessary focus and attention to our role in enabling the peace.

(U//FOUO) What's SIGINT doing in a place like this?!? It's making a difference, every day. That's what!

(U) NSA is truly a national treasure...not because of its technology... but because of its people. It has been my great honor to serve with you all! Farewell, God Bless America, and...stay In The Fight!

Chief, CSG Joint Staff (at the Pentagon)

(U) What's so exciting about being here? Well, we often see issues we've worked on being discussed later on TV by the Secretary of Defense. And like Forrest Gump, I occasionally just happen to show up in areas where big-name people are passing by, such as Gen. Tommy Franks and (gasp!) Brit Hume.

(U//FOUO) "Life, as we know it, will cease to exist if I don't see MG Quirk immediately." As MG Quirk's executive assistant, this is one of the many dramatic opening lines that I've heard.

(S) Since this is known as the "world's most dangerous road" we try to spend as little time on it as possible. That means not staying in the same place for any period of time and pushing our Chevy Suburban to 110 mph .

From Charles H. Berlin III
SID Chief of Staff
Thursday, August 21, 2003
(U) Here's the last lesson: you work with and around the best people in the world - they have courage, heart and compassion. Consider yourself lucky, cherish this idea and remember it is a privilege to lead Americans with a mission like ours. As a leader you will necessarily have to judge performance and behavior, but you need not judge your teammates as people - it has already been established: they're the best.
(U) Watch for the conclusion tomorrow!
