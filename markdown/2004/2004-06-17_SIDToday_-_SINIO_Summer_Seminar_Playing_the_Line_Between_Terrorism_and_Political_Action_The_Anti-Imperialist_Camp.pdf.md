(U//FOUO) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present one in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for Summer 2004. "Playing the Line Between Terrorism and Political Action: The Anti-Imperialist Camp" will be presented by SINIO for Counterterrorism, on Tuesday, 22 June, from 1130-1300 in Room 2N044 . Advanced registration is required - instructions follow.

# (U) Course Overview: 

(S) The events of September 11 brought new urgency to the task of identifying the dividing line between legitimate political activity and activity that is the precursor to, or supportive of, terrorism. The Vienna-based Anti-Imperialist Camp is ostensibly a political organization. However, its many ties to terrorist organizations - and its attempts to collaborate with Muslim extremists - raise questions about where political action fades into terrorism and the extent to which otherwise legitimate organizations provide support and extend the range of action for terrorist organizations.
