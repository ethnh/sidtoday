(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: Jack Israel sent the following note to the Analysis \& Production (S2) workforce on last week:
(U//FOUO) It's with a heavy heart that I want to inform you that I am leaving NSA after 25 years of service. I have been offered the job of Chief Technology Officer at the FBI, and it is an opportunity I just could not pass up. In 25 years, one develops an enormous number of solid friends and professional acquaintances, and my hope is that these relationships will endure beyond this transition.
(S//SI) As many of you know, my passion as Technical Director for Analysis \& Production for the past 3 and a half years has been to build the stature of that position to positively influence the corporation. Many often think that technical folks, subject matter experts, TDs, TLs or whatever the appellation of the day is, do not have much authority or control. But I want to testify that serving in all of those roles at one time or another in my career at NSA, you have more authority and control than you think.
(S//SI) I've tested boundaries that I thought were there, and each time found out they were only in my mind. I've been enabled to conquer significant language and analytic problems early in my career, have a major impact on a critical new collection capability mid-career, and play a key role in driving corporate solutions to problems late in my career. This isn't a checklist about me, but a testament to the impact technical leaders can have anywhere when they put their minds to it.
(C//SI) As I leave NSA, I would challenge you continue to test those "boundaries," and provide leadership on the hard problems facing the agency. Don't shy away from them. If you don't take the lead on solving information overload problems, complex analytic and language tasks, or something like exploiting the Internet, nobody else will. Step into these hard challenges and fill the gap. I'll be watching from a distance and rooting for your success.

God Bless,
Jack Israel
