# (U//FOUO) The Customer Scorecard 

FROM: Customer Gateway (S11)
Unknown
Run Date: 10/15/2004
(U//FOUO) One of the key initiatives for the Customer Relationships Directorate for 2004 is to update and improve the Customer Support Plans (CSPs) for each customer of the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID). The main element required in making the CSPs better is feedback from the customer. To obtain this feedback, the CRD began a pilot program called the "customer scorecard". This scorecard will be used to determine how the Signals Intelligence Directorate is meeting its customers' product and service needs. More specifically, the purpose of the scorecard is to:

- Establish a baseline measure of customer satisfaction for all SID customers
- Identify opportunities for improving and adjusting Customer Support Plans as part of the overall Customer Account Management program
- Establish a new best practice for periodic assessment on one or more specific improvement ideas
- Collect overall feedback to ensure stronger customer relationships
- Demonstrate the importance of listening to the "voice of the customer"
(U//FOUO) The scorecard does not replace good account management practices such as capturing customer needs and providing relevant support services; rather, it augments them. The questions on the scorecard have been carefully selected to ensure that the feedback obtained can have a direct impact on areas important to the customer and specific goals that CRD targeted. Thus the scorecard should help us distinguish what is essential to achieve success.
(U//FOUO) Each interaction between SID and the customer must add value to the relationship. That is why the interview questionnaire is designed in a thoughtful, conversational and nonthreatening way. The Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM) and Account Manager (AM) should be familiar with the customer's current needs and history working with SID. Over time, as customer information becomes more readily accessible, this familiarity will be easy to achieve, but in the meantime SEAMs and AMs should be well prepared not only to discuss the scorecard, but also to capture other customer feedback related to product or service improvement suggestions.
