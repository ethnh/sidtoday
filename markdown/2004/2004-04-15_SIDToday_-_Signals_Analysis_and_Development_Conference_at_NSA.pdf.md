(U) The 2004 Signals Analysis and Development Conference (SADC) will be held at NSA HQS, Ft. Meade, Maryland, May 24th through the 27th . This year's theme is "Signals Analysis: Following Through to SIGINT Successes." The focus will be going beyond the first level of signals analysis and documentation, and highlighting those efforts where signals analysis led to successful sustained production of intelligence.
(C) The conference will kick off with our keynote speakers in the Friedman Auditorium at 9:00A.M. on Monday, May 24th. Keynote speakers are:

- Mr. Charles Meals, Deputy Director for Signals Intelligence;
- Mr. Fran Landolf, Chief Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services; and,
- Dr. Branch Head, Communications Signals Analysis, Research and Development, GCHQ.
(U//FOUO) The Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services Group (S31) sponsors this annual conference for the signals community. Attendees are collectors, signals analysts, technique/tool developers, and target development analysts from NSAW, field sites, 2nd Party Partners, as well as other intelligence agencies in the Washington, D.C. area. The technical briefings, roundtables and demonstrations primarily highlight CES efforts (OTP, SAO, SIO, NAIC, MUSKETEER, Signal Development Centers (SDC), etc.) to deploy prototype search and collection capabilities, analysis of intercept, documentations of signal/technology structure/usage, and facilitation/realization of hardware/software exploitation capabilities.
