# (C) DA and DIA Collaborate on Collection 

FROM:
Data Acquisition (S3) Chief of Staff
Run Date: 10/19/2004
(C) In mid-September, Data Acquisition hosted several visitors from the Defense Intelligence Agency's Directorate of MASINT and Technical Collection and Directorate of Human Intelligence for a collection-enabling meeting. As our DIA visitors were briefed on activities within Data Acquisition, including the Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC), Link Access, Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES) and Tailored Access Operations (TAO), many examples of the similar challenges both agencies experience crystallized. Several representatives from the Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD) and from Analysis \& Production were also present.
(C) For example, both Data Acquisition and DIA counterparts are investigating ways to measure progress from an end-to-end mission management perspective. Each is challenged with keeping up with the fast pace of technology (remember the horn graph?) by developing ways to exploit new, emerging forms of communications -- without losing sight of the more common technologies that are still used around the world by our targets. Each must find a way to ensure that collection results in delivering relevant, actionable, timely intelligence to our common customers. Each organization is addressing ways to eliminate or refine collection of irrelevant data. And both agencies see the need to go far beyond just coordination of their individual activities -- integration into each other's operations is the key to truly be effective.
(C) As a result, the CSRC is working with DIA representatives and with the CRD Customer Account Manager to find ways to work more closely. The possibilities range from Collection Officer exchanges to permanent integrees, as well as collaborative efforts against particular targets. This will result in a closer collaboration between DA and DIA to fill common gaps, to address mutual challenges and to build an effective partnership that reduces redundancy and increases effectiveness.
