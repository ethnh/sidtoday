(S//SI) From 20-22 January 2004, the Korea Issue Management Team (IMT) held the first ever "road" ROCK DRILL at NCPAC in Hawaii. Designed to test the cryptologic system's capabilities during a transition to war on the Korean Peninsula, this ROCK DRILL, the fourth in a series of Korean-related exercises, focused on Phases 1 and 2 of OPLANS 5026 and 5027, which detail an aggressive US/ROK reaction to a North Korean attack on South Korea. These recently-updated OPLANS formed the basis of scenarios that stressed the cryptologic architecture in a variety of ways. During three full days of work, the 70 ROCK DRILL participants may have failed to enjoy the tropical sunlight, but they succeeded in proposing a variety of solutions to mitigate or close gaps in NSA/CSS's ability to support USFK's newly unveiled Ten Critical Fights.
(S//SI) ROCK DRILL 4 was attended by NSA/CSS participants from South Korea, Japan, Hawaii and Maryland as well as customers from around the world. BG John DeFreitas, US Forces Korea (USFK) J2, set the tone by emphasizing that the need for collaborative yet candid discussions of issues and resolutions. BG DeFreitas then framed the discussions for the ROCK DRILL by detailing the Ten Critical Fights that that US/ROK Alliance needs to win in order to score a limited victory (as in OPLAN 5026) or defeat North Korea completely (as in 5027). With this in mind, the IMT, Military Integration Office (S13) and facilitator (OPSIGINT) led the group through a review and modification of the Cryptologic Support Plan and a large-group discussion of the scenarios. On the third day, the session broke into small groups to discuss issues in the categories of Collection, IT Infrastructure, Mission Management and Horizontal Synchronization (how NSA/CSS plans fit with those of other national and tactical intelligence producers). At the end, customer representatives from the State Department, USFK, and Pacific Command, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency were given a chance to comment on the process and the results, and all expressed excitement and optimism based on what they had seen.
(S) After the ROCK DRILL, the Korea IMT and its core team, consisting of S13, OPSIGINT, and our NCPAC hosts, met to match the week's accomplishments against its objectives, critically analyze the exercise and to determine the way ahead. BG DeFreitas made a surprise visit to this session and expressed gratitude for NSA's stupendous efforts and declared the ROCK DRILL a success.
(S) However, for the ROCK DRILL to truly be a success, we must capitalize on this energy. The Korea IMT is now in the process of digesting the material and will soon tag NSA/CSS people and organizations with follow-on actions. Those tapped for actions should be aware that the tasking deadlines will be aggressive. One of the salient points of OPLANs 5026 and 5027 is that it is defensive and USFK cedes the initiative to North Korea - therefore, NSA/CSS has to be ready to respond rapidly and on short notice -- North Korea's timeline, not ours.
(S) Next up for the Korea IMT is ROCK DRILL 5 (the US/ROK Alliance takes the offensive), scheduled for 19-23 April in Seoul.
