(U//FOUO) Here's a continuation to Wednesday's article on the National Virtual Translation Center...
(U//FOUO) Everette Jordan, the Director of the National Virtual Translation Center and detailed NSA employee, candidly spoke about his most recent effort. Mr. Jordan explained that the NVTC is a work in progress but is already successfully achieving its mission. It was created by congressional legislation as an official part of the Intelligence Community, and became fully operational on July 31st. Its leadership is drawn from the IC client agencies, with the FBI serving as the center's executive agent and the ADCI/A\&P* providing mission guidance.
(U) "What makes the Center work," explained Jordan, "is the center is both national and virtual. People all over the country are working on documents in secure facilities when necessary, and on their home computers when they work on unclassified." Jordan stated the unclassified portion amounted to roughly half of the total. Despite the large portion of unclassified work, all employees of the NVTC must be US persons and must undergo an investigation. FBI, as the executive agent of the NVTC, conducts the background investigations for the NVTC employees and provides other administrative support.
(U//FOUO) "This is a great opportunity for retired NSA employees. They can live in Florida and make some extra money in their robe and slippers. And they are helping their country," claimed Jordan. In addition to the opportunity for retired employees, Jordan discussed the waiver that has passed allowing current NSA employees to work at the NVTC in their leisure time -- just as they might work somewhere else, like The Home Depot. The work is on an "at-will and asavailable" basis, so a consistent work schedule is not necessary.
(U) In its first 18 months, the NVTC has established itself and become operational. In the next 18 months, Jordan foresees it solidifying its position and fine-tuning its operations. He wants to have qualified linguists "lined up and waiting," even for obscure languages that may suddenly leap to the forefront of importance.
(U) Aside from the translation work, Jordan described what it's like to work with other members of the Intelligence Community. He alluded to the unique jargon each individual agency uses in its operations, saying this was a "language" challenge of its own for the NVTC. "It's been quite an experience [building the NVTC]. I just buckled my seatbelt and held on tight!" Starting from scratch, Jordan and his staff had to create an identity for the NVTC from the ground up -- even including the need invent a logo for the organization. He considers this groundbreaking work the best job he's ever had in his career.
