(U) S31 Hosts Processing and Exploitation Conference

FROM:
Executive Assistant to Chief, Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (S31) Run Date: 11/01/2004
(U//FOUO) Cryptologic and Exploitation Services (CES) hosted the very first Worldwide Processing and Exploitation (P\&E) conference from October 5-8, 2004. In attendance were managers, technical directors, stakeholders and decision-makers from the Five-eyes government community, to include NRO*, CIA, SCEs** and field site elements, access providers and industry partners. The purpose of the conference was to provide a foundation for community collaboration based on a shared understanding of architectures, strategies and processes.
(U//FOUO) Almost 300 people attended all or parts of the conference. Subject matter experts briefed and led discussions on the current state of P\&E, strategies and plans for current and future endeavors, and collaboration among the partners. Panel discussions during the general conference conveyed the vision and strategy for the future of SIGINT processing and exploitation and outlined a roadmap for implementing that strategy. An executive session on the fourth day of the conference established a governance structure and a process for collaboration and decision-making.
(U//FOUO) Specific objectives for the conference were to establish an agreed-upon baseline, develop strategic goals, establish governance and oversight, and to establish a collaborative environment using a web-based tool for strategies, governance and capabilities development. These objectives were met not only from NSA's perspective, but those of the 5 -eyes and NRO partners. Specifically, the conference:

1. Provided an open forum for discussion of partner's P\&E strategies including architectures and plans for the P\&E zone, major interfaces, and data formats.
2. Illustrated major P\&E dependencies and integration strategies with access providers:

- TRAILBLAZER
- TDP (Technology Demonstration Platform)
- EITC (Enterprise Information Technology Center).

3. Communicated the current state of technology for the provisioning of P\&E services and the existence of specialized P\&E solutions.
4. Outlined the current state and needs for P\&E status reporting and monitoring for command, control and situational awareness.
5. Introduced the environment that will be used for P\&E collaboration, notably the Processing and Exploitation Portal for supporting the Exploitation Community Process (ECP), "go ecp".
6. Communicated primary research priorities for P\&E along with existing research and potential for solutions coming from ongoing R\&D activities.
7. Provided an impetus for the immediate collaborative pursuit of challenges associated with the convergence of plaintext and encryption processing into the enterprise P\&E architecture.
8. Established that P\&E solutions in the tactical environment are nodes on our SIGINT Extended Enterprise network, and how the P\&E community plans to merge the traditional lines dividing national and tactical environments.
(U//FOUO)) Preliminary feedback from conference attendees has been extremely positive. The true measure of its success, and the commitment to collaboration in capabilities development, will be monitored by the P\&E Steering Group established by senior representatives during the Executive Session.
