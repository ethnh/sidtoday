(U) SID has a long-standing policy of valuing diversity in the workplace. Ms. Baginski created a SID Diversity Manager function to help her focus on diversity issues. I am expanding the role of the SID Diversity Manager effective immediately.
(U//FOUO) I have asked Dr. Len Reinsfelder to make me fully aware of all diversity issues and minority statistics so that I can design and execute a plan to ensure that SID meets Intelligence Community and NSA goals for hiring, while expanding the diversity of our overall population.
(U//FOUO) I am interested in the full process including career development and recognition, especially promotions. Please cooperate with Dr. Reinsfelder as he prepares me to do the right thing.
(U) I want all of you to know that I am absolutely committed to diversity in the SID workplace. Each of us carries responsibility for ensuring that diversity - which makes us stronger.
