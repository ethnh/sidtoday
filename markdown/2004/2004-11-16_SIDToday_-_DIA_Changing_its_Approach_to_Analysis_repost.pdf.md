# (C) DIA Changing its Approach to Analysis (repost) 

FROM: $\square$
NSA Representative to DIA's Directorate of Analysis and Production (S112) Run Date: $11 / 16 / 2004$

The changes are aimed at looking beyong current intelligence needs. (C)
(C) On 6 October, the Research Director for DIA's Directorate for Analysis, briefed SID leadership on VADM Jacoby's* plan to realign DoD all-source analytic resources. This plan, officially titled the Defense Intelligence Analysis Program, but better known as "the 3Ms" for one of its basic tenets -- Master, Measure, and Monitor -- represents a fundamental change in the way that DIA approaches analysis.
(C) This is accomplished by grouping intelligence efforts into three categories:

- Master : the requirement to understand some issues and nations in great depth and breadth -- know everything about everything;
- Measure : to understand selected elements of some targets in great depth -- know everything about some topics; and
- Monitor : maintain global situational awareness -- know something about everything.

In addition, the plan is designed to eliminate analytic duplication by assigning responsibility for each topic area to that element of the community, (DIA, the Service Intelligence elements or Command Intelligence) with the optimum capability to accomplish the assigned tasks.
(S) 00000000 noted that this plan correlates well with the recent briefings on the National Intelligence Priorities Framework 5-year outlook, briefed two weeks ago at the National Intelligence Analysis and Production Board. He also stated that DIA will begin working on the major target areas in the "Master" country list by conducting a thorough review of the IC's collective knowledge on North Korean nuclear development.
(S) A working group of DIA, NSA, and NGA experts in this area will stand up shortly to begin this effort. Follow-on groups will bring together experts in the other topics and nations that comprise the "Master" list.
(U) Notes:

* Vice Admiral Jacoby is the DIA Director
