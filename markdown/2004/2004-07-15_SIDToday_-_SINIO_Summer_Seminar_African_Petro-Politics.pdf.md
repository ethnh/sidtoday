Run Date: 07/15/2004
(S) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present another in the series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for Summer 2004, "African Petro-Politics" will be presented by SINIO for Sub-Saharan Africa, and D/SINIO for SubSaharan Africa, on Tuesday, 20 July, from 1130-1300 in Room 2N044. Advance registration is required - see the Brown Bag Series webpage for instructions.

# (U) Course Overview: 

(U) African oil production is increasing dramatically. By 2015, the United States will depend on West African oil for $25 \%$ of its oil imports. U.S. investments in energy projects in the Gulf of Guinea have reached billions of dollars each year. Oil production in Sudan has been a factor in the Sudanese civil war, with oil wealth sharing being a primary negotiating issue in the peace process. Oil has played a role in the extent of corruption and in sustaining military might in several African countries. The historical development of the industry in select African countries and the impact of oil on their economies will be addressed. Finally, threats to - and security of the oil producing areas in West Africa will be discussed (including U.S. engagement to improve security).
(S) This brown bag session is classified (TS//SI). Session will not be videotaped.
