(U) SID Overtime/Comp Time/Credit Hour Rules and Guidance

FROM:
SID Workforce Performance Executive (S01P3)
Run Date: 04/05/2004
(U) SID wants to ensure all managers and employees are consistently guided by the same policy and procedures for the approval of overtime pay, compensatory (comp) time accrual and use and credit hours. Agency policies simply specify that key components and field chiefs have been delegated the authority to approve overtime and comp time and this authority may be redelegated to the lowest level for efficiency.
(U) Below is some background information, guidance and suggestions to help managers and their employees more effectively manage their work and personal lives. Although we may occasionally have to set aside our private life to meet exceptional demands, the importance of our families and personal lives should not be underestimated or forgotten. A balanced work and personal life is critical to a person's well being and the Agency mission.
(U) As General Hayden has stated:
"Because of the NSA/CSS work force's hard work and unfailing dedication to mission, we often push ourselves way beyond reasonable limits in the hours we work. I am keenly aware that these efforts can come with a high price for our mental and physical health and family life. Please remember that care for yourself and your family is as critical to mission success as putting in the many hours I have witnessed by our work force."
(U) We all need to maintain a balance between our home and work life. As managers, we must be aware of the need for work/life balance and we should encourage our work force to find this balance. However, managers need to lead by example; we cannot say one thing and then do another. There may be a perception that employees must put in the same long hours and weekends that managers work in order to receive promotions and awards. This is not the best leadership example and it may also be misinterpreted by the work force.

(U) You can easily see the trend. Our people - managers and employees alike - cannot keep up this pace without breakage, either at home or at work. With this information in mind, we are providing some basic ground rules, some guidance and suggestions of ways to help the work/life balance for employees.

# (U) Policy 

(U) Valid reasons for a manager to approve overtime (regular scheduled or irregular) or comp time include:

- To meet intelligence objective requirements
- Crisis situations
- Scheduled overtime (i.e.; 24/7 shops)
- Temporary, unexpected increases in workload
(U) The following are not valid reasons for approving overtime or comp time:
- Manpower shortages
- Poor management
- Using overtime pay and comp time to compensate for poor annual leave scheduling
- Using overtime as a means of increasing personal compensation
(U) The above information is available in the abbreviated form of a "cheat sheet" that gives the basic "do's and don'ts" for overtime, comp time and credit hours. In addition, a listing of helpful URLs is available. Finally, a reference document with detailed information on Ideas for Scheduling Work Hours is posted on the Workforce Performance Management webpage.


## (U) Summation

(U) The bottom line is to prevent burnout, minimize personal, physical, psychological issues and mission loss. SID wants to maintain a happy, satisfied workforce that contributes to the overall productivity and success of the mission. This can only happen if we all balance our work and personal lives.
