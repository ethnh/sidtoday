# (C) 5-Eyes Global Network Forum 

FROM:
GCHQ Integree, Link Access Planning and Requirements Division (S3341) Run Date: 07/07/2004
(C) In mid June, 15 representatives from NSA traveled to CSE in Ottawa, Canada to attend the inaugural 5 Eyes Global Network Forum (GNF), and were joined by members from DSD, GCSB, GCHQ and CSE* to establish a ground-breaking forum that will address the challenge of global network access from a 5 Eyes perspective.
(U) Here's why ...
(S//SI) During recent years, there have been significant shifts in the way targets communicate across the globe, as well as an ever-increasing number of tools that enable rapid and effective connection to the global net from almost any position on the surface of the earth. From a SIGINT perspective, this has forced a fundamental change in the way we approach Global Network communications.
(S//SI) Our target's use of commercial services have highlighted the need to coordinate collection efforts across all available accesses in order to more effectively exploit the Global Network. This approach stresses cooperation among the 5 Eyes partners on access availability and the need to take full advantage of each partner's finite resources.
(TS//SI) The agenda for the three-day conference was comprehensive, with Heads of Delegation keen to define the structure and governance of the GNF in addition to addressing topics coordinated in the months prior to the forum. Of particular interest were the ratification of the GNF charter and the documents proposing mechanisms to address the sharing of sensitive data to a wider audience across the 5 Eyes Intelligence Community.
(TS//SI) There was a positive atmosphere from the start of the conference, with each agency very willing to play a role in the success of the GNF. The GNF accepted the challenging responsibility for developing the strategic vision for the 5 Eyes Intelligence Community across Global Network accesses in accordance with the 5 Eyes SIGINT Business Vision (SIGINT Strategic Action - Access). Initially, this will include COMSAT, Special Source and STATEROOM, and will cover:

- cross-agency architectural and technical solutions (where appropriate),
- Operational planning and Mission Management,
- coherent SIGINT Development and
- Sustained Collection.

The GNF will be led by a Senior Steering Group (SSG) consisting of the representative of each agency attending the GNF as Head of Delegation.
(U//FOUO) Thanks to background work with the partners prior to the conference, several agreements were reached and the first GNF was a great success. To maintain the impetus generated at the inaugural forum, the next iteration of the GNF will be held at NSA in early December 2004. Stay tuned for more details...
