(U//FOUO) Menwith Hill Station is celebrating its new Internet capability with an analyst challenge and a party as the reward.
(C) With funding support from SID SIGDEV, MHS/Ops was able to purchase the necessary equipment and install workstations to access the Internet "non-attributively" across a dedicated leased line. MHS/Ops currently has 8 workstations servicing 30 accounts, but within 3 months another 33 workstations will be installed to accommodate a "pent-up demand" of 50-60 accounts.

## (U) The Challenge

(C) The first MHS analyst or team of MHS analysts who use the new non-attribution Internet capability to significantly further MHS SIGINT knowledge and/or enable a MHS-specific, or a MHS mission partner's SIGINT success, will be rewarded with a party thrown in their honor. The achievement(s) and/or new discoveries must be something unique and deemed operationally significant by a team of MHS DO Technical Leaders. Ops Chief Mike Del Vecchio and will host the party.
(U//FOUO) The Menwith discoveries (and winners) will be posted on the SID Internet Program website and the "Success Stories" page.
