(S//SI) From 19-23 April 2004, the Korea Issue Management Team (KIMT) held Rock Drill 5 in Seoul, Republic of Korea (ROK), testing the cryptologic system's capabilities deep into a conflict on the Korean Peninsula. ROCK DRILL 5 addressed the issues resulting from an allied counteroffensive deep into North Korean territory, the seizure of Pyongyang and the eventual conquest/occupation of the entire North Korean landmass - Phases III and IV of OPLANS 5026 and 5027. While reacting to a North Korean attack (Phase II) has been the subject of a previous ROCK DRILL and many exercises, ROCK DRILL 5 represented the first-ever Cryptologic Community-wide discussions on the later phases of a Korean war. As such, a lot of eyes were opened, assumptions challenged, myths exposed and epiphanies experienced.
(S//SI) Continuing in the KIMT tradition of breaking new ground with every ROCK DRILL, ROCK DRILL 5 was also the first exercise of this type to be held with a Third Party partner, as the 22 and 23 April sessions were held at the ROK's Defense Security Agency (DSA). These sessions exceeded expectations, giving DSA its first glimpse at the recently revised United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command OPLANs and generating lively discussions that indicated shifts in DSA's thinking about supporting the war effort. Since $95 \%$ of the troops involved in a resumption of the Korean War would be South Korean, synchronizing DSA's efforts with those of NSA is imperative, and ROCK DRILL 5 succeeded in starting that process.
(S//SI) ROCK DRILL 5 was attended by NSA/CSS participants and customers from South Korea, Japan, Hawaii and Maryland. Holding the ROCK DRILL in Seoul allowed for widespread theater participation and an appreciation by NSAW personnel of the challenges of the combined peninsula environment. BG John DeFreitas, United States Forces Korea (USFK) J2, set the tone by emphasizing the need for collaborative yet candid discussions of issues and resolutions. BG DeFreitas then framed the discussions for the ROCK DRILL by detailing the Ten Critical Fights that US-ROK Alliance needs to win in order to score a limited victory (as in OPLAN 5026) or defeat North Korea completely (as in 5027).
(S//SI) Large group discussions led to smaller expert-focused groups to work on key issues in the categories of Collection, IT Infrastructure/Network Security, and Analysis/Production. During the DSA sessions, the small groups focused on National-Tactical Integration and Collection. From both the large-group and small-group discussions, gaps were discovered and actions taken that will result in improved cryptologic support for USFK, PACOM and State Department. GEN LaPorte, Commander UNC/CFC/USFK, addressed the U.S.-only ROCK DRILL session and at the conclusion BG DeFreitas expressed gratitude for NSA's "valuable" efforts, declaring the ROCK DRILL a success.
(S) On the Saturday following ROCK DRILL, BG DeFreitas treated most of the participants to a "Lay of the Land" tour, which acquainted those from off peninsula with the field sites and command posts associated with prosecuting the North Korean target. Helicopters ferried ROCK DRILLers to Third ROK Army headquarters, P'y√Ç'ng t'aek (home to Field Station Korea), Osan (location of the 303rd IS), and the wartime command post (CP Tango). For all, this provided a revealing perspective of the cogs in the peninsula cryptologic machinery, as well as a bird's-eyeview of some of the rugged terrain on which a resumed conflict would be fought.
(S) The Korea IMT is now in the process of digesting the material and will soon assign NSA/CSS people and organizations with follow-on actions. Those tapped for actions should be aware that the tasking deadlines will be aggressive. One of the salient points of OPLANs 5026 and 5027 is that the plans are defensive and USFK will be reacting to North Korean provocations - therefore,
NSA/CSS has to be ready to respond rapidly and on short notice. The timeline is North Korea's, not ours.
