(U) SINIO Summer Seminar: A Look at Saudi Arabia's Challenges

FROM: Marilyn Maines
Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 09/16/2004
(S) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present another in the series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for Summer 2004. "A Look at Saudi Arabia's Challenges" will be presented by D/SINIO for Near East South Asia, and Brenda Martineau, SINIO for Economics, on Tuesday, 21 September, from 1130-1300 in Room 2N044 . Advance registration is required - see the Brown Bag Series webpage for instructions.

# (U) Course Overview: 

(U//FOUO) A key coalition partner in the Middle East is Saudi Arabia, home to the al-Saud royal family, the two major Islamic pilgrimage sites, and a changing national and foreign resident population. Many challenges face the future stability of Saudi Arabia; in our Brown Bag, we will concentrate on three areas:

- Will the royal family succumb to age, corruption, and unpopularity? Or is there a younger generation of royals ready to take over the helm? Is there a plan of succession to the throne, and who might be pulling the strings in the background?
- Does the country have insurmountable internal security challenges? How have Saudi security forces reacted to the recent major terrorist attacks on Saudi territory? Have they "finally woken up", and will Saudi cooperation with U.S. counter-terrorism efforts be forthcoming?
- With 50\% of the population under the age of 18, is Saudi Arabia a "demographic timebomb"? How do domestic issues determine the national future with respect to education and economics? And what is the influence of the U.S.-Saudi relationship on national affairs and economics?
(S) This brown bag session is classified (TS//SI). Session will not be videotaped.
