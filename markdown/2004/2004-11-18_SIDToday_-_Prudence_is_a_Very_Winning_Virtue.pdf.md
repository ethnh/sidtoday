(U) Prudence is a Very Winning Virtue!
FROM: 'Prudence' the OPSEC Dragon
(and the SID OPSEC Program Managers (S02L3))
Run Date: $11 / 18 / 2004$
(U//FOUO) Hi again. I'd like to thank all the people who submitted a name for me to choose from last month. As you can see, I've chosen a name, with the help of the SID OPSEC Working Group. My new name is Prudence. Isn't it pretty? (U//FOUO) of Menwith Hill Station submitted the winning name.
(U//FOUO) In his submission, he quoted someone named Whewell who said, "Prudence supposes the value of the end to be assumed, and refers only to the adaptation of the means. It is the relation of the right means for given ends." Seems to me that's a fancy way of saying that being prudent in the information we give out (by practicing good OPSEC), keeps our people and mission safer. That definitely sounds good to me!
(U//FOUO) In the coming months, you'll be seeing a lot more of me as I begin my new job spreading the word about OPSEC across SID. You should also begin seeing a renewed emphasis on OPSEC throughout your daily work life, as the SID OPSEC team works with your office coordinators to broaden the scope of the OPSEC program across our missions. Remember, though -- you don't have to wait for someone to tap you on the shoulder to start bringing OPSEC into your job! Just think about the five steps, and begin applying them on your own. In case you need a refresher, they are:

1. Identify Critical Information
2. Analyze the Threat
3. Analyze Vulnerabilities
4. Assess the Risk
5. Apply Countermeasures.
(U//FOUO) If you have any questions about OPSEC in SID, you can contact

U//FOUO) I'll be working closely with them to make sure you get all the support you need. I look forward to talking to you again soon!

Yours truly,
Prudence
