## FROM: <br> TAC Chief of Staff

(U//FOUO) The Target Analysis Center (TAC) is pleased to welcome it newest Chief. who replaces the outgoing Chief, Ms. Debora Plunkett. What is the TAC, you say? It is one of three centers included in the larger SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) Strategy and Governance organization established in the summer of 2002. The TAC strives to address the issues of knowing the global networks such that the NSA can fulfill its goal to know the target, its technologies, and its social networks to enable meaningful intelligence production.
(U//FOUO) The TAC's mission is to develop corporate-level analytic tools and techniques to assist the processes to collect, exploit, and analyze target systems on the global network such that the SIGINT system will know and own the target space especially when events require it.
(U//FOUO) To accomplish our task, we work with other SIGDEV centers to synthesize and access network, target, and technology knowledge information to develop a complete and coherent target picture. We also develop tools and techniques for target activity analysis using the datasets we enable, such as Global Intelligent Network mobility services, including processes for event analysis throughout the SIGINT community.
(U) To learn more about what we do, see the TAC missions and functions.
(U//FOUO) If you think we may be able to assist you in getting to know the various technologies of your targets, understanding the various tools available to the analyst, or even trying to discover what data might exists that you were unaware of, just give us a call or send us an email.
(U//FOUO) Today the TAC has three separate subelements: the Metadata Analysis Cell (MAC), the Social Network Analysis Workcenter (SNAW), and Target Development Services (TDS). In coming weeks, you'll be seeing messages here describing their work in more detail. In the meantime, visit our website to find out more: "go TAC".
