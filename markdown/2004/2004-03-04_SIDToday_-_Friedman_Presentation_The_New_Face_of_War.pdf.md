(U//FOUO) The International Affairs Institute (IAI) presents: "The New Face of War: How War Will be Fought in the 21st Century" by Bruce Berkowitz, Senior Analyst, Rand Corporation on 8 March 2004 from 1030-1130 in the Friedman Auditorium.
(U//FOUO) Mr. Berkowitz will discuss his new book, in which he describes how the overwhelming influence of information technology on the definition of military power has changed the face of warfare. Berkowitz argues that as Western forces wage war against terrorists and their supporters on several continents, there are four key dynamics to the new warfare: asymmetric threats, advanced information technology, short decision cycles, and network organization.
(U//FOUO) Mr. Berkowitz is cleared to the TS//SI level, and the discussion may reach that level. All cleared personnel are invited to attend. Please join us for what promises to be an engaging presentation and discussion of a new framework for understanding combat.
(U//FOUO) The session will be videotaped for rebroadcast. IAI members are eligible for preferred seating; general seating will begin at 1015 .
