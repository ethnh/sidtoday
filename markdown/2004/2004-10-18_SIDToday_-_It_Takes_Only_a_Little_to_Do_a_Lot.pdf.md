(U) The Combined Federal Campaign makes it easy
(U) Were you ever in Scouts? Had a loved one affected by disease? Taken a walk in a park? I am sure that all of us in one way or another have been affected by the myriad organizations represented by CFC. During the next six weeks, it is our chance to give back to those people and groups of people that have helped, consoled, toiled for our benefit.
(U) The National Security Agency has been a leader in the CFC for many years. Last year, the SID workforce alone contributed almost $\$ 691,000$ with only $18 \%$ participation. The participation goal for the Agency this year is $25 \%$. As the largest directorate at NSA, what a huge difference SID could make if we raised our participation to $25 \%$. This is SID's chance to lead the way to a brighter future. Be a part of that future by choosing a charity and participating in the campaign.
(U) The benefits of contributing to a charity do not end with that "feel good" glow, however. Because the contributions are annotated on your pay slip, it is easy, come tax time, to get the final tally of your contributions. No saving receipts and check stubs to prove to the IRS that you have been a charitable person all year.
(U) And with the online registration, participation is so easy. It takes less than 10 minutes and there are no forms to fill out. Just type "go cfc" in your browser and click on the prompt for online donation along the right hand side. You will also find the list of upcoming events and activities for the remainder of the Campaign on this page!
(U) Throughout SID, each organization has a coordinator/canvasser to assist you with your questions. For the list of SID CFC volunteers, visit One of these volunteers may be contacting you and sharing information with you about the Combined Federal Campaign. Listen to them. They will have everything you need to do a lot with just a little.
