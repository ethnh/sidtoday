(U) In previous SID today articles we mentioned the development of a new online OPSEC course specifically for SID employees. We are pleased to announce the availability of OPSEC 1201 OPSEC for SID Personnel, to be offered on your desktop via VuPort. The SID Training Authority announced this course in a SID-all email on 3 JUN 04.
(U) The course will cover OPSEC history, the elements of OPSEC, and the OPSEC process. The majority of the OPSEC theoretical information has not changed much over the years, so this shouldn't be new to you.
(U) The course will cover your roles and responsibilities towards OPSEC in light of the new public NSA/CSS environment. Then it will look at your adjusted roles and responsibilities as reflected by the War on Terrorism. The next step will take you through a real-world example of a SIGINT operation in a non-conventional location.
(U) Enrollment: This course is available via the NCS Technology-based delivery platform, Vuport. To access this course, type "go Vuport" in the location dialog box of your web browser, or click on the following - $\square$. Type in your Vuport ID and password and click on LOGIN. Then click on WebTrain and on to the OPSEC, where you should be able to register for the course. Visually impaired should contact the NCS for a text version of the course.
(U) It is our hope after completing OPSEC 1201 you will have a better understanding of OPSEC and how you can apply the process to your daily mission. With the constant threat that we are experiencing, it is more important than ever to apply OPSEC to your daily practices both in work and home situations.
(U) For more information, contact $\square$ or $\square$ OPSEC Program Managers on $\square$
