# (U) External Conference Calendar

(U) Do you know of a conference or seminar on a topic or issue of potential interest to other SID employees? Would you like to know of such events? There is a simple way to share such information as well as learn it. The External Conference Calendar, which can be found from a link in the "Calendars" section of the SID today page, makes it easy to do either. With a few mouse clicks, anyone can put seminars, events or conferences - open source or classified - on the calendar.
(U) This unique means of information-sharing alerts a possibly unknown audience to academic, business, intelligence community, or other conferences, with potentially great payoff. For instance, someone in a Crime \& Narcotics branch attending a conference on "International Reduction of Crime" may not realize that there are others in seemingly unconnected areas, such as counterterrorism, homeland security, or research and development that could benefit from the target knowledge and discussions. When the conference is listed for all to see, everyone with an interest will be aware.
(U) The External Conference Calendar gives us all a chance to convey opportunities for learning, career developing, and target knowledge. Please consider entering your conference information to this link!
