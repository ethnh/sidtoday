(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: We asked to consider the following question when writing about her day of shadowing: "What surprised you about SID and your shadowing experience?"
(U//FOUO) Before I arrived to shadow MG Quirk for the day, I already had some opinions formed about what the day would be like. In reading previous SID shadowing experiences, many people had stressed how busy the SID leader's day was, but I don't think I quite understood just how busy it could be. I arrived in MG Quirk's office at about 0715, a little before the SID Leadership morning meeting began. I was introduced to MG Quirk, and then we were off.
(U//FOUO) The day continued with meeting after meeting after meeting. In addition to the eleven meetings and appointments scheduled for the day, including a meeting with the Iraq Issue Management Team (IMT), the SID Leadership morning meeting, various briefings and one-on-one meetings, MG Quirk was constantly squeezing in phone calls and addressing issues that came up throughout the day.
(U//FOUO) At one point, I was told this was a light day, in comparison to his schedule on other days. When a VTC on the Spring Offensive was postponed because of technical difficulties, MG Quirk took advantage of the break in his schedule to squeeze in some extra time at his computer. I was surprised by his ability to shift gears so effortlessly. As we jumped from meeting to meeting, at times literally running through the hallways to get to them, MG Quirk was prepared to change topics quickly and discuss the matter at hand.
(U//FOUO) I was surprised to see many of the same faces repeatedly during the day. The various SID Leaders were involved in many of the same meetings throughout the day. While I attempted to keep names, faces and positions straight in my mind, it struck me that it wasn't really important what positions they held. The SID Leadership Team really acted as a team. They all provided input on the various topics discussed, and while the SIGINT Director often led or directed the meetings, he always asked for and placed equal importance on all participants' input.
(U//FOUO) Many of the meetings that I sat in on seemed to have a common theme. The focus was on where the Agency as a whole was headed in the future. When first entering MG Quirk's office, I immediately noticed a large white board with a somewhat chaotic diagram with lots of circles and other shapes connected to each other in various ways with different SID organizations and issues written throughout. I soon learned that this was a diagram for the new SID governance structure that the SID leadership has been working on, which made more sense after MG Quirk explained it to me. Throughout the day, MG Quirk referred to this diagram in meetings and briefings and was constantly tying things back to the idea of governance.
(U//FOUO) One particularly interesting briefing, again attended by the leadership, was on Mission Allocation. The briefing suggested possible scenarios for expected increased hiring as well as moving some aspects of the SIGINT mission to the field through developing new regional sites. It was stressed in these meetings that the issue of governance and the changes the Agency was attempting to undergo were supposed to be a transformation -- not a destination the Agency was hoping to arrive at, but a journey.
(U//FOUO) When I hear about topics that trickle down to us here in the workforce through
agency all e-mails, DIR-grams, the SID today webpage and other sources, many of these issues seem intangible. Sitting in on these meetings allowed me to gain greater insight into the processes and decision making strategies that go into these issues and how they affect me. My day allowed me to appreciate the role of the SIGINT Director and his day-to-day work that makes SIGINT happen. I thoroughly enjoyed my day shadowing the SIGINT Director and would like to thank MG Quirk and his gracious staff for making my experience so worthwhile.
