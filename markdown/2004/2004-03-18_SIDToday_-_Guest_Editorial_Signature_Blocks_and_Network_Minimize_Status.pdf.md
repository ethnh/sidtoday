(U//FOUO) Agency policy from CIO requires that all electronic mail have signature blocks identifying the sender. This is documented in CIO-025-2001 dated 12 June 2001. At a minimum, your signature block should contain your name and organization, with the organization description being unclassified. Other locator and identification information is always welcome. This is a convenience for the recipient if he/she needs to know a little more about you. There are several examples in the referenced SPF.
(U//FOUO) If you are on an NT, you can set up a signature file to be automatically added to your emails.

- Click on help,
- Click Microsoft Outlook Help,
- Click Answer Wizard, then search on "signature"
- Click on the first returned item "Create a signature for messages."

Step by step instructions will take you through the process.
(U//FOUO) If you are on a UNIX machine, see this webpage for instructions for setting up your email signature block:
(U//FOUO) The CIO policy does not specify anything about graphics being included in your signature block, but there is a network minimize in effect that restricts the sending of attachments that are not absolutely necessary to the conduct of official Agency business. Therefore, it just doesn't make sense to clog up the Agency communications systems with graphic packages in your signature block, or even worse, extraneous attachments that serve no operational purpose. Some emails have JPG and other attachments with pictures tagging along that simply take up room in our cyberspace.
(U//FOUO) One such attachment that has been seen is about 5.5 kb in size. This could easily add 72 mb to the Agency infrastructure in a year with that file going to only one recipient of each mail. Then multiply that by all the cc's on the mails, forwards, etc. and you're taking up one heck of a lot of space for nothing. Likewise, if those messages are saved in your personal files, those attachments are taking up file space.
(U//FOUO) Many thanks to $\square$ Chief, CES Desktop and Infrastructure Services, S31521, for his help in working out the details of the extraneous attachments and for providing the websites for creating the UNIX signature blocks and the policy SPF.
