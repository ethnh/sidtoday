(U) It's hard to believe that another holiday season is already upon us bringing 2004 to a close. We appreciate the holiday season because it gives us all a chance to step back and reflect on the year gone by, to think about the things we accomplished and the things we need to work harder on in the future. On this occasion, we'd like to invite all of the SID employees to come to the SID Holiday Open House -- those we know and those we have yet to meet, those who have been here for years and those who are brand new to the SID community. So mark your calendars for 14 December, 2W106, from 1130-1330. We really look forward to seeing all of you.
(U) Our best to you and yours during this holiday season,

MG Richard Quirk, Signals Intelligence Director
Charlie Meals, Signals Intelligence Deputy Director
Karyn Vice, SID Chief of Staff
