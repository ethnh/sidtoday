# (U) Final Chapter 

FROM: SIGINT Communications
Unknown
Run Date: 07/23/2004
(U)The Mission was halted at Bad Aibling Station in April, this year. But the final signs of NSA's presence at BA will not be removed until the last days of September 2004. Giving us the chance to again, tug at the memories of those who traveled to or where stationed there. What follows are a few more things that will confirm the experience.

We have included translations for those of us that weren't lucky enough to have had the chance to learn these things on our own.
"You know you are a BA veteran if..."
...you know Lilo is not a cartoon character but, a BAYRISCH WOMAN, (a Bavarian woman)
...you know what it is like to be behind a cow stau,
(traffic jam - Bavarian farmers move dairy cattle from field to barn on public streets, at "rush hour")
...you can tell the difference between OBSTLER and ZWETSCHGENWASSER.
(Two types of schnapps, one made from apples and pears, one from plums)
...you know the appropriate holiday roles of KRAMPUS, BOLLERSCHUTZERS and HEILIGE NIKOLAUS
(Krampus and Heilige Nikolaus are the two alteregos of Santa Claus - Krampus is a goat-headed monster who gets the bad children, Nikolaus is St Nick. Bollerschutzers are men in lederhosen who shoot black powder firearms to make noise to drive away evil spirits.)
...your door has C+M+B written over it.
(Caspar, Melchior and Baltasar, the three wise men. German children dress up as them during the twelve days of Christmas, and go door to door to sing a carol and raise money for UNICEFlike charities.
...you wish we had RUHETAG and PFINGSTFERIEN in the US.
(Quiet/day off during the week, and a Pentecost/Whitsun holiday vacation)
...you bought MEHRWERTSTEUER ABWICKLUNGSCHEINEN in lots of 10 or more.
(Value Added Tax exemption forms)
...you have savoured IMBISS CURRYWURST while watching the APO guys "load" your outbound Christmas mail into the truck.
(sausage shack - fast food grill)
...you participated in more than one Station MAIBAUM.
(May pole festival)
...you know that the German word FLOETZINGER may be used in polite company.
(a beer made near Bad Aibling in Rosenheim )
...the phrases "TDYers" and "ELLMOSEN" are hard-wired together in your brain.
(a small village near Aibling with a gasthaus popular with tdy'ers)
...you have gotten to the top of the WENDELSTIEN by each of the following means: 1) Gondola Lift, 2) Cog Train, and 3) Hiking.
(mountain landmark looking down on BAS - tallest mountain in the local area.)
