(S) In recent years, NSA has been working hard to plan, in advance, how we will provide SIGINT support to U.S. military actions around the world. One of the ways we do this is by drawing up Cryptologic Support Plans (CSPs), each tailored for a potential military operation. For example, a series of CSPs has been developed for the Iraq conflict and is being maintained as operations there continue; CSPs are also underway for Korea, the Horn of Africa, and the Global War on Terrorism.
(U//FOUO) The intended audience of the CSP is twofold: cryptologic representatives at the various Combatant Commands, who explain to military commanders how NSA will provide SIGINT and information assurance support to their particular operations; and, secondly, the NSA leadership, who are informed about how relevant players within the Extended Enterprise are committing their resources to the problem at hand. A critical purpose of these CSPs is not only to provide a detailed description of what NSA can and will do in support of military operations, but also - and often as important - to clarify what NSA cannot do. This helps to manage the command's expectations and has been quite influential in military planning for recent operations.
(U//FOUO) CSPs describe the NSA/CSS concept of cryptologic support to a specific military Operations Plan (OPLAN) or Concept Plan (CONPLAN) developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff or by one of the military Combatant Commands. Plans officers in the Customer Relationships Directorate's Military Integration Office maintain continuous contact with NSA representatives in the Combatant Command Cryptologic Service Groups (CSGs), J2 (Intelligence Directorate) staff members, collection managers and others involved in the planning process. Once they are notified that a planning process is underway, the plans officers begin to build a comprehensive description of that OPLAN or CONPLAN for the NSA audience. Simultaneously, they gather information that is immediately available from the target offices of primary interest, collection management offices, Service Cryptologic Elements (SCE) and a host of other sources in the form of posture papers or strategies for collection and reporting in the geographic area of interest. All of this information is factored into the resulting CSP.
(U//FOUO) The process leading to a completed CSP is further enhanced by synchronization sessions known as Operational Planning Team (OPT) meetings, with participation by representatives from all relevant offices in SID and IAD. The OPT provides for two-way communication through the office representatives between military planners and technical experts, collectors, analysts, managers, and others. The CSP may be continuously maintained for ongoing campaigns, or developed as a reference for OPLANS and CONPLANS as they are revised on a biennial cycle.
