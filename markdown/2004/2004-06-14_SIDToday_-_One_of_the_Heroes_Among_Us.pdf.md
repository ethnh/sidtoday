(U//FOUO) Captain Matthew Reiley, USMC, currently assigned to Target Reconnaissance and Survey (S316), has been recognized as the SID Junior Officer of the Year, and has also been honored with the National Military Intelligence Association's Major General John E. Morrison Award. Once you read the following (abridged) list of his recent accomplishments, it will be plain to see why.
(TS//SI) In part, Captain Reiley:

- led two separate, back-to-back survey teams during 67-day deployment to Iraq during the hottest summer months in extremely dangerous locations;
- planned and executed over 80 combat missions outside US and coalition installations while operating/traveling through northern, central and southern Iraq;
- navigated his 6 -vehicle, 18 -person unit over 3500 miles through hostile territory; his convoy received enemy fire on 7 occasions; his leadership/ground skills were critical in ensuring the personal safety/survivability of his team and successful completion of both survey missions;
- selflessly volunteered to extend for a second deployment as OIC (Officer in Charge) of the MUSKETEER FRANKLIN survey team right after a grueling 45-day TDY, during which time he baselined existing and re-emerging comms in Iraq, improving the intel picture for NSA and OIF (Operation Iraqi Freedom) commanders;
- trained 15+ tactical SIGINT teams on the local signals environment in Iraq, thereby improving their ability to provide force protection to their supported commander;
- briefed 150 people at CENTCOM's OEF*/OIF "lessons learned" conference; his briefing was one of the conference's best and expertly delivered!
- prepared over 20 NSA personnel for deployment to crisis areas around the world, including SLO* and NCR* Iraq, CSG* Baghdad, Team Kabul OICs, GRSOC* and Military Integration personnel; gave them best awareness of their theaters;
- based on his excellent previous track record during two deployments in 2003, he was selected as the action officer to lead 227 personnel through a very detailed and exhaustive 3-month planning effort to re-establish a Forward Operating Base in Baghdad;
- developed, within two weeks of arriving, three separate Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on movement, convoys and emergency action drills for teams deployed in Baghdad; his procedures have already helped one NSA team survive multiple improvised explosive devices which detonated during their convoy to Ar Ramadi from Baghdad;
- took an NSA physical and personnel security team on a survey operation in Baghdad; provided his three SOPs as a baseline for them to apply to all NSA personnel in theater; these will become the standard for formal security and escort procedures for all NSA personnel in Iraq; NSA security team praised them for their usefulness.
(U//FOUO) Capt. Reiley was born in Hollywood, California but grew up in eastern Oregon. He
enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve out of high school and was in the USMC Reserves for four years while attending Eastern Oregon University. After graduating from the Platoon Leader's Course in 1995, he was commissioned as a 2ndLt. Capt. Reiley is married to a 2 ndLt. also in the Marine Corps. She flies the CH-53D helicopter and is just wrapping up an assignment at the US Naval Academy as a physics instructor.
