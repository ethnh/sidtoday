(U) Combined Federal Campaign 2004: A Way to Help

(U) As 2004 winds to a close, the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) has opened for business and will remain open until 30 November. The Campaign, established by Executive Order in 1961 by John F. Kennedy, is a painless way to ease someone else's pain. This year's theme, "Every 1 of US," reflects the notion that we are all in this together and every one of us can be a hero. Last year the Agency alone donated $\$ 1,596,199.20$. This year, the goal is $\$ 1.6$ million. Working together, I am sure that we can make this happen.
(U) However, the CFC won't be all work. The Campaign will sponsor events that will not only be enjoyable, but will raise funds for this very worthy cause as well. For a list of upcoming CFC activities, visit " go cfc.".
(U) As we at NSA go about our daily business of protecting our country, we should also remember that the United States is made up of individuals. Some of these individuals at times cannot help themselves. Some of these individuals are trying to help others. So, although you may not be able to push a wheelchair, save an endangered species, read a book to a disadvantaged child or find a medical cure, by donating money through the CFC, you will be providing very practical help to many different non-profit organizations that are doing those things and much more. With over 2,600 local, national and international organizations available for your contributions, there is a charity that everyone can feel good about supporting.
