(U) New DDAP's Address to S2

FROM: Carl Johnson
SID/Deputy Director for Analysis and Production (S2)
Run Date: 09/24/2004
(U//FOUO) Carl Johnson, the new chief of S2, sent the following message to the A\&P workforce this week:

Colleagues,
(U//FOUO) My first order of business is to express my deep respect and appreciation to Jim Allen for his leadership of Analysis and Production over the past year. Jim's efforts have positioned A\&P on a course to be successful over the coming years and we will miss him dearly. We wish Jim and his family Godspeed and prosperity.
(U//FOUO) I'm honored to lead Analysis and Production and humbled to be re-associated with this fine work force. I'm committed to further transforming A\&P to facilitate robust production for the foreseeable future. My assignment feels very much like a homecoming and I'm tickled to be back into the thick of analysis. For the meanwhile, I will continue the policies and activities that SID and Jim have put into place for A\&P. I will NOT make immediate, sweeping, or significant changes right away; although, I'm keenly aware of the need to provide our work force with stable IT and adequate analytic and reporting tools. That said, I will work hard to facilitate these infrastructure changes quickly throughout the entire enterprise. I look forward to visiting our production and analytic centers soon, both here at NSAW and across the enterprise.
(U) Analysis and Production's superior performance is well known across the IC and our client base. I'm confident we will continue this stellar work and that you will continue making significant contributions to our clients' success and the defense of the nation. We will celebrate mightily and we'll ensure that our people understand the great work they perform and the impact it has on the nation.
(U) You will be hearing more from me as I gain a stronger foundation on the mission and tasks before us. Again, I'm thrilled to be back and I look forward to reacquainting myself with A\&P and to be working with old friends. Although my schedule is hectic, my door is open. People are most important to me and I will make time. Together, we'll continue the great work A\&P is known to produce while transforming to remain relevant.

Carl
Carl L. Johnson
Deputy Director for Analysis and Production/S2
