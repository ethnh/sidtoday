(C) The successful collaboration of NSA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)* is a story repeated time and again as two organizational cultures and traditions are exposed to one another and harmonized to produce intelligence products and information that is an enrichment of the fused disciplines. NGA's presence at NSA has expanded from three to 78 personnel over the last several years. This expansion includes Geospatial Analysts, Imagery Analysts and support personnel at Headquarters as well as the Extended Enterprise to include the Regional Security Operation Centers.
(C) Conversely, NSA has expanded its presence within the NGA footprint. Historically, NSA has had one Representative position at NGA for over 37 years. Now, NSA has increased its footprint from one to nine. These positions include both liaisons as well as analysts integrated within the NGA Production Directorate. These integration efforts have contributed to increased awareness, cooperation and partnering between the two agencies.
(TS//SI//REL) NGA Integrees have served with the Geospatial Exploitation Office (GEO) from its earliest days. An early example of this ongoing collaboration was the support given to a Combat Search Air Rescue (CSAR) effort in Afghanistan for a downed US helicopter during Operation ANACONDA in February 2002. NGA Integrees quickly located imagery of the downed helicopter, which assisted GEO personnel in plotting SIGINT activity associated with the Taleban forces near the crash site. This information was fed to forward tactical elements for targeting consideration. Air strikes were directed against these sites, which cleared the way for the rescue helicopter to retrieve the survivors.
(C) As the capabilities and awareness matured, we have found new benefits to include:

- Greater context for intelligence analysis : use Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) as context for SIGINT intercept and SIGINT as context for GEOINT
- Cross-cueing between INTs : apply each other's INT to enable more precise, dynamic tasking and analysis
- Revealing high value intelligence : use each INT to discover information that might otherwise not be recognized for its full intelligence value separately
- Fused reporting : provide a more coherent representation of disparate components of SIGINT and GEOINT to intelligence customers
- Leveraging expertise : identify and share areas of expertise for mutual benefit including tools, techniques, and knowledge
- Discovery of organizational touch points : quickly identify individuals, organizations, and mission elements to pass on high priority intelligence finds and collaborate on customer needs
- Synchronization against the national priorities : improve transparency of operations to ensure an optimal balance of resources is applied by each agency against the nation's most critical needs
(U) NGA and NSA have created partnerships that bring together the talents and expertise of both agencies in all contexts and disciplines. These capabilities reflect a progression toward the
shared vision of the Directors of both NSA and NGA.
*(U) Notes:
NGA was formerly known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)
