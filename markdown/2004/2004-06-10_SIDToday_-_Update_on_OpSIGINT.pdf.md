(U//FOUO) Einstein reportedly once said, "The most important thing is not to stop questioning." This is good advice for the SIGINT system to follow if it is to avoid the "status quo mentality" into which large bureaucracies can easily fall. The daily demands of producing SIGINT eat up much of our collective energy, often leaving little time for developing new approaches and ways of doing business. It is for these reasons that Operation SIGINT (OpSIGINT) was created in September 2001.
(U//FOUO) What does OpSIGINT do? We are a small team working on behalf of SID senior leadership to tackle today's impediments with innovative solutions in important, target areas. Our goal is to both provide immediate relief and to better position the SIGINT system for future success. The team applies best business practices to this creativity and brings people together from across the SIGINT Enterprise, all with the aim of collaborating to produce better SIGINT for our customers. In this way, OpSIGINT supports SID's strategic goals for Transformation 2.0 and Horizontal Integration.
(S//SI) The OpSIGINT Task Force Leads recently briefed the SID senior leadership team on our activities and impact. OpSIGINT Task Forces are currently addressing specific mission gaps associated with the North Korea and Iraq/Counterterrorism targets and are providing support to the Issue Management Teams on a number of strategic fronts. SID leadership is pleased with how these efforts are going, and has reaffirmed its commitment to the OpSIGINT effort.
(U//FOUO) OpSIGINT will kick off a comprehensive recruitment effort in early summer to replace departing OpSIGINT detailees and to address new SIGINT challenges. I encourage everyone in SID to consider taking advantage of this career-broadening, eye-opening opportunity to work in a stimulating environment in which new ideas are encouraged and the opportunity exists to learn from some tremendous SIGINT professionals.
