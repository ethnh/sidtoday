(U//FOUO) SID Leadership Meeting Held in Friedman
FROM: SIGINT Communications
Unknown
Run Date: 09/30/2004
(U//FOUO) The SID Leadership team addressed a full house in Friedman Auditorium on Monday, September 27 for the first SID Leadership Meeting. The team, consisting of SIGINT Director MG Quirk, Deputy Director Charlie Meals, DDCR DDAP Carl Johnson, Deputy DDDA Jim Cusick, and SID Technical Director Dave Hurry, spoke to the audience of SID leaders and managers about the future of SID as a cryptologic expeditionary force. This concept extends from the Director's message of NSA becoming a global SIGINT system.**

(S) In response to the new global concept, SIGINT Director MG Quirk discussed the topic of governance and how SID is responsible for tying all of the missions throughout the Extended Enterprise together. He impressed upon the room full of managers and technical leaders that it will be the job of SID leadership to make this global governance effort a successful one.
(S) A major component of NSA responding to the need for SIGINT to be a global operation is mission dispersal -- the term used to connote the movement of some SIGINT missions to the various RSOCs and Mission Ground Stations around the world. MG Quirk and Mr. Meals explained that mission dispersal will not necessarily entail a mass movement of personnel from Fort Meade, instead there will be a combination of hiring on location and some PCSing.
(S) Mission dispersal was a hot topic throughout the meeting. After MG Quirk offered his perspective on how the Signals Intelligence Directorate is affected by this new global concept, each of the Deputy Directors presented their thoughts on their respective organizations' role in this process. A discussion of this issue carried over into the question-and-answer session, with SID leadership seated in a panel formation. Questions came from the audience and phone-ins from across the Extended Enterprise.
(U//FOUO) Mr. Meals unveiled the SID Leadership's new communications initiative called "chain training". This process requires a leader to meet with the personnel 1 and 2 echelons down from their position to pass along information and to provide a more candid and open structure for discussing new issues, or for expressing concerns. In the future, in addition to SID Town Meetings for the entire SID workforce, the Signals Intelligence Director and Deputy Director will meet with the DD's and the DD's immediate reports. (There will be more detail on "chain training" in upcoming articles on SID today .)
(U//FOUO) The briefing slides from Monday's meeting are available for viewing.
