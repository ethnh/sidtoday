(U) My thanks to all of you who were able to come to the IA Town Meeting last Friday (Feb 27). I found out after the meeting ended that there had been a mix-up and the feed was not sent to NEWSMAGAZINE until about 10 minutes in. I'm not sure why, but my sincerest apologies to any of you who tuned in at 0900 and got nothing.
(U//FOUO) We've posted all the briefers' slides on our homepage -- it's the last item under "IA Skill Community Information" ("Go IASC").
(U) The videotape has to be reviewed for classification and then duped before copies will be available. You may request a copy of the Town Meeting by sending an email to $\square$ nsa (DL TAPEDUPE from an NT) with the following information:

Your name
Your building
Your room number
Your suite number.
(U) Be sure to specify the name and date of the program: IASC Town Meeting, 27 February 2004.
(U) We're also investigating converting the VHS tape to digital and making it available as streamed video on the ANALYSToday portal. I'll keep you posted on all that.

And thanks again!
