(U) A Patriot's Story

(U//FOUO) Patriotism is not uncommon in the NSA population. It is, in fact, a requirement for working here. However, there are those among us who have expressed that deep and nearly indefinable sense of duty and loyalty in a very overt manner. They are naturalized citizens, who in response to the attacks of September 11, volunteered their talents to defend their chosen homeland, hoping their service might show their love, their sense of duty...their patriotism. What follows is the story of $\square$ one such SID employee:
(U) My family migrated to the United States in 1983, but decided to go back to Jerusalem. I returned to the U.S. in 1989 after I graduated from high school. It was the second year of the Palestinian Intifada, and attending college was nearly impossible. So, I came back to America to continue my education.
(U) I spent the first year in a small private college in Mt. Vernon, Georgia. A year later, I transferred to the University of Maryland. I graduated in 1995 with two degrees in Business Administration, one in Marketing and the other in International Business.
(U) I began work at a Web-hosting product group in 1997. I was married in 1998. After the birth of my son in 2001, working outside the home was not as important to me. I had no intentions of going back to the workforce, until September 11th, 2001.
(U//FOUO) As I tried to absorb all that came with that numbing event, I remembered the oath I took when I became a citizen, to protect and defend this country and I thought, "Now, my country needs my skills to fight this war on terrorism." I applied to -- and was hired by -- the FBI to work as a linguist. I later came to NSA.
(U) I feel privileged that I am able to give back to the country that gave me more than my own birthplace was able to give. The U.S. gave me the opportunity to get an education, a job, and to become one of its citizens without feeling that I was different or did not belong. I was able to participate in any program, from health care to retirement, just like any other citizen. I have the same privileges and access as anyone born here. In Jerusalem, where I was born, I was banned from many programs. When I think about the rights and privileges offered to me in my birthplace compared to the ones of my adopted country, I have a feeling I cannot describe or put into words, except to say: " God bless America!"
(U) You can read more about what has been doing since she came to SID here.
(U) Have a safe and happy 4th of July and remember those who will be here at work and those on the front lines who are ensuring our continued independence!
