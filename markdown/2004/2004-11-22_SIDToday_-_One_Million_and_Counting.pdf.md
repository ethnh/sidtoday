CFC passes one million dollar mark in 2004 campaign (U)
(U) The National Security Agency has already passed the one million dollar mark in the Combined Federal Campaign. One million dollars is a lot of money, especially when you consider that it came from a relatively small population - NSA. The money donated will be used throughout the country and the world in a variety of ways during the coming year. We should all feel good about that and be very proud.
(U) One million dollars is a lot of money, however, our goal is $\$ 1.6$ million. There are very few of us in this building, or any building in the NSA complex, who have not benefited from one of the organizations under the CFC umbrella. Admit it, no one stands alone in this world. No one can do it all by themselves. No one should ever have to.
(U) That is why we are calling on you to help bring the totals up to the $\$ 1.6$ million mark. SID's portion of that total is almost 640,000. To date, we have donated $\$ 417,820.19$ with a participation rate of $11 \%$. That $11 \%$ of the SID population has already given nearly $65 \%$ of our goal is a testament to the generosity and largesse of those individuals. Thank you for your donations.
(U) There are eight days left in the campaign. Certainly enough time to fill out a form on-line and send it in. Let's bring up the numbers. Let's contact our CFC representative. Let's work together, so that when Thanksgiving comes, we can all be thankful that the opportunity to give is made so easy for us through the CFC.
(U) Combined, we produce the best SIGINT in the world. Combined, we protect the nation from those that would do us harm. Combined, we can substantially make a difference in the world through the CFC.
(U) You are one in a million point six!
