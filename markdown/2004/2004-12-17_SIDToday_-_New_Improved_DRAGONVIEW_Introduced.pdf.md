(S//SI) In September, we told you about a powerful visualization tool called DRAGONVIEW (see previous article ). Since then, we've released version 2.0, which features major enhancements to DRAGONVIEW's GIS functionality. Version 2.0 provides new data layers, support for new map formats, and even a basic geolocation capability calculated from the signal strengths of collected 802.11 packets. Additionally, DRAGONVIEW now processes BOOTP/DHCP, and features an improved unique beacon filter.
(S//SI) To request a copy of DRAGONVIEW version 2.0, view the version 2.0 release video, or check out our future release notes, simply type " go dragonview " in your web browser. You can also learn more about what DRAGONVIEW can do for you by watching our new infomercial, which has recently aired on TalkNSA and 15 Minutes:
