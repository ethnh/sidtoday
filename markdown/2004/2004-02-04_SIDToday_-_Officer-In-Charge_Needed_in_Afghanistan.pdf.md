This deployment has a duration of 90-120 days at Bagram, AB, Afghanistan . Training work-up time is approximately three weeks, depending upon the skills that the deployer already possesses.

We are seeking personnel with strong leadership skills and extensive knowledge of SIGINT operations (strategic and tactical). The individual should also have knowledge of the extended SIGINT enterprise with some SIGINT analysis experience. Some of the specific SIGINT background areas include: support to military operations, counterterrorism, force protection, fusion analysis and collection management. A working knowledge of military command structures, NSA databases, and software applications are essential. (MIL SPECS: Cryptologic or Intelligence Officers).
(S) Selected individuals will act as the OIC. They will direct cryptologic support operations for TF-121.2 and act as the senior SIGINT advisor to the commander and TF-121.2. Additionally, the OIC is responsible for ensuring NSA is kept aware of TF-121.2 planned and on-going operations, and the Commands Key Intelligence requirements. Selectees for this position will ensure that TF-121.2 NSA analysts fuse SIGINT with other sources of data to provide actionable information for dissemination to strategic and tactical commanders. The OIC analyzes daily operational and intelligence developments in order to affect the operations of the supported TF-121.2 elements within the AOR.
(U//FOUO) The NIST Branch, in coordination with several Agency offices, will train and equip deploying personnel. The candidate's professional background and experience will determine the amount of time for training. Normally, training consists of a three to six week pre-deployment package, to include extensive analysis training for mission operations, target areas of interest, weapons training, as well as personal protective measures training. In this case the individual selected will likely only have three weeks to prepare, which is why only those with the strongest NSA backgrounds will be considered.
