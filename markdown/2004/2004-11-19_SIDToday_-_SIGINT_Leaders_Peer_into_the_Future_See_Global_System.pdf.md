Big-picture issues dominate the agenda; how to make the global SIGINT system run like a welloiled machine? (U)
(U//FOUO) Last week, SIGINT leaders flew in from around the world to attend the annual SIGINT Site Commanders Operational Review here at Fort Meade. This year's SCOR conference focused on how we are to govern the global SIGINT network in the 21st century. It went very well. It gave Extended Enterprise leaders the opportunity to look into the complexities of the task facing us, and allowed them to participate in designing solutions.
(U//FOUO) We didn't come out with a finished plan, but we did gain an appreciation for the biggest component of this transformation: our behavior as an organization. That is to say, how will we interact which each other so that we have the right people doing the mission in the most efficient way? This goes beyond flow charts and mission and function statements!
(U//FOUO) During the conference, it became clear that we must become a net-centric organization -- an organization that is truly a network of collaborative partners instead of one based strictly on traditional hierarchies or a hub-spoke structure. The capstones of a net-centric organization are transparency and collaboration .
(U//FOUO) (U//FOUO) We need a transparent network to show all of the SIGINT players what all of the other players are doing. In the military, this is called a Common Operating Picture (COP). In order to create such an environment, we must first invest in our future infrastructure. A few points:

- Some elements of this infrastructure already exist, some are being built, and others are part of long-term acquisition programs.
- We will not wait until all of the pieces are in place to start using them.
- Users will help develop the tools they need.
- The infrastructure will require oversight, but the oversight will be facilitative and supportive rather than directive. We will set the basic environment, and let the COP grow over time. You can think of this as an "Internet model" for our global networks.
- All SIGINTers will be able to participate.
(U//FOUO) The investment in our infrastructure will also create an environment that will enable and foster the second capstone of a net-centric operating environment -- an environment of collaboration. Collaboration in this sense is not limited to analysis, but on governance and decision-making as well. We want everyone to be able to work together in a push-pull manner across the global enterprise to make the right individual and corporate decisions on how best to produce SIGINT. We will aim for good decision-making throughout the system, not a top-down approach, and intend to create collaborative environments to allow this to happen. Of course, the SIGINT leadership will be responsible for making decisions to resolve issues when conflicts arise -- but top-level involvement will be the exception rather than the norm.
(U//FOUO) There will be more on our SCOR observations in my next article. Meanwhile, continue your great work and your great teamwork!
