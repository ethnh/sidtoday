(U//FOUO) NSA's Wireless Portfolio
FROM:
Wireless Portfolio Management Office (S318)
Run Date: 09/24/2004
(TS//SI) In early 2002, Fran Landolf, Chief, Cryptanalysis and Exploitation (CES), was endorsed by the SID Director to be the SID Senior Manager for Wireless. "Wireless" is defined as those personal communications devices offering mobility and location-based services such as cell phones, satellite phones, trunk mobile radio, WLAN and the like. Its challenges are primarily persistent access, user identification, and geolocation. Not to be overlooked, these devices also sport some very hard encryption.
(TS//SI) Recognizing at that time that the exploitation of this critical set of technologies lacked a comprehensive and cohesive strategy, both internal to NSA and across the IC, Mr. Landolf set plans in motion to formalize our activities. By late 2002 the Wireless Portfolio Management Office was established, and strategy and governance of our exploitation capabilities against wireless communications began in earnest. The role of the WPMO is to:

- Define and Implement the Wireless Strategy
- Shape and Influence Corporate Policy and Architecture
- Align and Direct Efforts within NSA
- Coordinate and Leverage Efforts within the S-Eyes SIGINT Community
- Monitor and Influence Efforts within the US Intelligence Community
(TS//SI) To date, the WPMO has developed a Wireless Strategy, a Wireless Implementation Plan, USSID 252 governing how wireless exploitation capabilities are shared and protected in tactical environments, and a formal Memorandum of Agreement with the CIA on joint governance of how wireless exploitation capabilities are shared with liaison entities. The WPMO routinely coordinates input for the SID Senior Manager for Wireless, NSA's Foreign Affairs Directorate, military liaison offices, and others regarding the numerous requests received for specific, immediate needs to share capabilities beyond NSA.
(TS//SI) In drawing up the Wireless Implementation Plan, the WPMO and extended team gained comprehensive knowledge of NSA wireless development activities across Data Acquisition, Analysis \& Production, and Research, including product specifications, limitations, budget and sensitivity of the activity. The team documented both existing capabilities as well as what ought to be initiated to better exploit the technology set.
(TS//SI) To get started, the team concentrated on the President's Approved Intelligence Topics (NSPD-26) and quickly learned that every wireless technology was used by every Band-A concern, meaning none of the technologies could be ignored. The team also embraced the wireless strategy's four pillars for accessing wireless communications, in priority order of consideration: Buy it, Enable it, Take it, and finally Collect it. In addition, the team looked at the Foundational Tools and Services required to exploit wireless, an often-overlooked part of the cost of doing business.
(TS//SI) We laid out program plans for a basic level, a credible level, and an unconstrained level of investment. Moving away from proximal collectors toward accessing wireless data at the network core will mean a significant increase in the Buy it, Enable it and Take it pillars -- what that buys us in terms of tangible results is robust exploitation of most of the wireless technologies used worldwide and improved global coverage. We must now move out smartly toward making the plan a reality.
(S//SI) The Wireless Implementation Plan has been endorsed by MG Quirk and the SID Deputy Directors. For more information on the strategy and governance of wireless exploitation, visit our website at
