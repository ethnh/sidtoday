(U//FOUO) With the official announcement of the 2004 promotions, we would like to congratulate those promotees, and everyone involved, for a very successful promotion process. SID will promote 903 people this year, which represents $15 \%$ of the eligible population. SID managers did a great job of recognizing our lower graded analytical and technical skills and high potential personnel in keeping with Agency policy. We encourage the continuing feedback and mentoring of all personnel to guide career development and set expectations.
(U) We expect that Human Resources will publish the promotion lists on 28 June-- this allows time for managers to notify every promotee before the full list is made public. Following are charts showing SID promotions by grade and Skill Community.
(U) Congratulations to all.
