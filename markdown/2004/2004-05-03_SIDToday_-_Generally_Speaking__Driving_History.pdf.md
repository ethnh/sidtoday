# (U) Generally Speaking: Driving History 

FROM: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director
Run Date: 05/03/2004
(U) Have you ever made a decision or performed an action and then stepped back and wondered about the historical significance of that decision or action? In the work we do, with our unique perspective on global events, it is often easy to feel like an observer of history, rather than a participant or an actor. So, we are often oblivious to the major roles we play in history.
(U) We may think we are all passengers on the "Magic History Bus", but in reality we all have a steering wheel, a gas pedal, and a brake, and the actions and decisions we make every day drive and steer history.
(S//SI) The cryptographers working at Bletchley Park during World War II to break the German Enigma encryption probably had little conception, at the time, of the importance of their work. Yet, the efforts of those cryptologists represent one of the greatest achievements in cryptology and are widely regarded as a key to allied victory. I think years from now, historians may look back at the role of NSA in the Global War on Terrorism in a similar light - and will conclude that the work done in the Global SIGINT Enterprise played a key role in the success of our nation.
(S//SI) I think it is important for us to sense the moment - to understand that a significant portion of the outcome of this war rests on our shoulders, and to realize that we are indeed making history in the work we do. At night when we go home, it is easy to forget the impact of our daily work on the events we see on the nightly news. It's also easy to forget, that in many ways, when we come to work we are soldiers on the front lines and our decisions and actions will make or break us as a nation.
(S//SI) For the past $2 \AA^{1 / 2}$ years, you've been fighting this fight and assuming the burden. All of us, whether working from home offices or volunteering for deployment (over 1500 people have deployed since 9/11!!) are part of this fight. Other SIGINTers have come out of retirement, or come back as reservists. We are all working for the good of the nation. To everyone I say: keep up the great work! And when you have a moment, take a step back and realize the important roles you are playing in this critical time for our nation. You are driving history!
