(U//FOUO) When it comes to protecting extremely sensitive COMINT sources, methods, relationships, and/or activities, sometimes TS//SI is not enough. This extremely sensitive information needs greater safeguarding and limitations to access than the regular COMINT Control Channels can provide. This material is controlled under a system called Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI), the successor to the old (and now defunct) VRK system.
(U//FOUO) The ECI system is designed to maximize information sharing while still ensuring adequate security. Each ECI program is known by a unique cover term abbreviated as a trigraph. The person responsible for all matters concerning the conduct of an ECI program within an organization is called the ECI Control Authority (CA).
(U//FOUO) NSA/CSS Policy 1-41, " The NSA/CSS Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI) System," establishes policy and assigns responsibilities for the management and administration of the ECI System. The accompanying NSA/CSS Manual 1-41, "NSA/CSS Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI) System Guidance Manual," provides procedural guidelines from the SIGINT Directorate (SID) for the implementation, management, and administration of this system. These and other policy documents can be found on the Office of Policy and Records web site .
(U//FOUO) As the executive for the management of all NSA/CSS ECIs, SID has centralized and streamlined the ECI approval process, as described in Manual 1-41. The SID/SIGINT Policy Staff will help organizations move their ECI proposals through this process, and they also welcome suggestions on how to make the process run more smoothly. Please direct your questions or comments about ECI to the SIGINT Policy Staff at DL SID_POLICY or @ems.nsa .
