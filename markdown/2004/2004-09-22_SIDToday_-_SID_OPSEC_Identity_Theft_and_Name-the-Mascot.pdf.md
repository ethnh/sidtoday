(U//FOUO) SID OPSEC: Identity Theft and Name-the-Mascot
FROM: the SID OPSEC Dragon
Dictated to: $\square$ and $\square$ (S02L3)
Run Date: $09 / 22 / 2004$
(U//FOUO) Hi There! Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the new mascot for the SID OPSEC program. My name is ---- actually, let's talk first. What I have to talk about is much more important than who I am, right? Recently my humans (a.k.a. the SID OPSEC Program Managers) sponsored a briefing for SID personnel on the topic of Identity Theft. Just in time, too! One of them got an email that very night from someone pretending to represent Citibank, asking her to go to a website and type in her password. Can you imagine? Trying to "phish" for information from someone who earns her living helping people keep their information secure! How silly! Of course, nobody would ever try to steal my identity, although I'd like to see someone try. I'd toast 'em!

# SID OPSEC Dragon 

(U//FOUO) Anyway, we hope you enjoyed the Identity Theft presentation. We know that many more people wanted to attend than we could accommodate, so we're working to schedule additional presentations in the future. Work/Life services and Security also sponsor similar events, as does TFCU, so hopefully everyone will have a chance to receive education on this important topic soon. We'd love to hear your feedback from this session as well, so please email your comments to $\qquad$
(U//FOUO) Now, on to what's really important. ME. I'd love to introduce myself, but, well, I can't. One of my humans found me recently, but no one knows my name -- including me! They tried to suggest various names to me hoping I'd remember who I was, but no luck. I don't want to insult them, but frankly the names they suggested were pretty lame. I mean really, a magnificent purple OPSEC dragon needs a dignified, regal name. Or at least one that people can pronounce! It is getting tiresome being addressed as "Hey, Dragon!" though.
(U//FOUO) I think I finally hit on a solution. A name contest! Everyone in SID is encouraged to participate. This is pretty important to me, so I'd like a lot of names to choose from. After all, I am the new face of OPSEC in SID. That's a big responsibility. I need just the right name to really make a statement. That's understandable, isn't it? So, here's the deal. You put on your thinking cap and suggest a name or two. Send your suggestions to $\square$ @nsa and $\square$ @nsa before COB 13 October 2004. An exclusive panel of judges will review the suggestions, and whoever submits the winning name will win a fabulous prize. Ok, so maybe not fabulous, but you'll at least win a prize. So please, help me find a name soon!

Thank you,
Name unknown
The SID OPSEC Dragon
