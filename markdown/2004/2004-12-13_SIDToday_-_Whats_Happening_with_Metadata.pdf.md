(U) What's Happening with Metadata

FROM:
Implementation Lead, SID COMINT Metadata Strategy
Run Date: 12/13/2004
(S//SI) "Metadata" refers to information about a communication, rather than the actual content of the communication. For example, this includes data used to route the communication, details needed for billing, tracking or authentication, formatting, etc. All of the SIGINT System's wideranging activities to collect, analyze, present, and use COMINT metadata are summed up in the SID Metadata Strategy .
(S//SI) For SID's Deputy Directorate for Data Acquisition (DA, S3), the Metadata Strategy goes beyond the obvious requirements for DA to develop and access metadata: DA is recognized as playing an important analytic role and as such is a critical customer of the Strategy, as well as a provider. It is also important to recognize that no element of the Strategy belongs to an individual line organization within SID -- implementation of all of its components must be orchestrated across the many stakeholder organizations.
(S//SI) The end-to-end vision of the Metadata Strategy includes:

- A Global Metadata Service that delivers all the metadata necessary for SID's analytic needs;
- Automated analysis that both frees the analyst from repetitive tasks and discovers potentially lucrative information;
- Tools, tailored to an analyst's needs, for presenting metadata information; and
- Making metadata associated with targets and technologies immediately accessible to the collection systems, for constant improvement of the quality of COMINT.
(S//SI) During the first six months of the Strategy implementation, the lead team has focused on areas related to Digital Network Intelligence (DNI), specifically target-related metadata. For example, we are:
- Developing a new DNI "rich" metadata architecture and a strategy for achieving the Global Metadata Service;
- Merging tasking interfaces;
- Creating DNI contact chaining through MAINWAY ;
- Incorporating DNI communication event data into FASCIA ; and
- Pursuing new storage paradigms (e.g. CONDENSER) that meet wide-ranging needs.
(S//SI) More broadly, work continues across SID on everything from link and network characterization, to advanced analytic techniques in research. There are four full-time members of the Strategy team, a larger "core" team working on a wide variety of implementation aspects and guiding the strategy, and others working the development and advancement of analytic methods. Details of the Strategy can be found at " go metadata " on NSAnet. The team can be contacted via email at "DL METADATA".
