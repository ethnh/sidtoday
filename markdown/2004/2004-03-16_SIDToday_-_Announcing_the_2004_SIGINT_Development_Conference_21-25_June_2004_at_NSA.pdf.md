SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance
(U//FOUO) Planning is currently underway for the SIGINT Development 2004 Conference and while there is still much work to be done, we want to provide everyone, particularly our colleagues throughout the Extended Enterprise and our Second Party partners, with advance notice so travel plans can be made.
(U//FOUO) This annual event provides the opportunity to network with SIGDEV experts from around the world and to learn about the latest tools and techniques. An important outcome of the conference is to identify positive steps that can be taken in the coming year to improve our SIGDEV capabilities by working as a community on some of the toughest SIGDEV challenges.
(S//SI) We will kick off the conference in Friedman Auditorium on Monday 21 June with a keynote address, followed by State of SIGINT Development reports by SIGDEV Leaders from NSA, GCHQ, CSE, DSD, and GCSB. The remainder of the conference will consist of a series of focused workshops, usually in smaller conference rooms -- relatively short briefings and tool demonstrations geared toward generating the exchange of ideas among the participants. This year, we are planning workshops on the following topics:

- Physically Locating Targets (including geolocation)
- Unified Events Analysis/Discovering New Targets
- Network Analysis
- Broadband Access and Survey
- SIGDEV Support to Tactical Operations and Force Protection
- Non-SIGINT Support to SIGINT Development
and more.....
(U) Visit the SD2004 website often. We will be continuously adding new information as workshop leaders, agenda and other details are confirmed. If you are interested in leading a topical discussion within one of the identified tracks, please send an abstract of your proposed talk to either the workshop leader or the conference alias $\square$ or DL SDCONF). We will also consider presentations on topics outside the main threads, scheduling them as sidebar sessions throughout the week.
(U) So, mark your calendars... start making plans to attend; we need your participation to ensure the success of SD2004. The conference is open to all fully cleared personnel. Contractors are welcome, but should be currently performing SIGINT Development work.
