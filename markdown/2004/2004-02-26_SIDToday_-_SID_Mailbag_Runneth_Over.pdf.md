(S//SI) The SID Mailbag gets some of the most interesting questions. The current installment has answers to questions as diverse as the risk management aspect of providing access to databases for customers, to why funds were expended for cake, ice cream and OIF coins. Do you know what the difference is between the SINIOs and the IMT's?
(U//FOUO) These and a few other topics are addressed this time around. Take a moment to read the thoughtful questions and answers in the February 24, 2004 edition of the SID Mailbag. You can find the link for the SID Mailbag on the SID today homepage, posted just below the articles. Look in the Workforce Outreach category, on the left-hand side.
