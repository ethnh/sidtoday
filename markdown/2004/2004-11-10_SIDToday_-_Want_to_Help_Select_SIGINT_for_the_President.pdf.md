(S) Want to Help Select SIGINT for the President?

FROM:
Chief, Cryptologic Services Group, CIA (F52)
Run Date: $11 / 10 / 2004$
(S) Are you interested in being on the front line for selecting SIGINT to brief the President, his Cabinet, and Intelligence Community officials? If so, then do two things. First, check the field vacancy announcements on Monday to learn about current job openings at CSG CIA. Then, plan to attend a brown-bag session on Tuesday, 16 November from 1200-1300 in 2N007. During that session, I will provide more information and answer your questions about assignment at CSG CIA.
(S) Working as NSA's representative in the DCI Operations Center (where the CSG is located) is definitely interesting. Just two weeks ago, I briefed the newly-appointed DCI on how the Intelligence Community's CRITIC program works (following some excellent GRSOC* CRITIC reporting). During that exchange of information, Mr. Goss asked me, "Does the President have this information?" After assuring him that the President was informed, I thought to myself: "Wow...this is definitely work supporting the very top of the government!"
(S) Our big responsibility here in the CSG is to support the Presidential briefers. We select the SIGINT each day that meets their reporting thresholds for briefing their principals. We have an intimate, constructive relationship with the briefers, and they make us proud each day by telling us that SIGINT is often the best intelligence that is shown to the President -- at home or on the road -- as well as to the Secretary of Defense, State, the National Security Advisor, and other Cabinet-level officials. We also brief senior DCI officials, to include the A/DCI for Collection, the National Intelligence Council Chairman, and officials from CIA's Office of Collection Strategies and Analysis.
(U//FOUO) CIA also has some very interesting people that come through the Operations Center. In just the last month, baseball star Cal Ripken Jr. and movie celebrity Robert DeNiro were both here -- at our desk -- receiving an unclassified view of how the DCI directs Intelligence Community operations.
(U) At the end of the day, however, the real benefit to being part of the CSG CIA is knowing that you are on the intel front line -- and that's incredibly rewarding. Please review the vacancy announcements, and I'll see you at the brown bag on Tuesday!
