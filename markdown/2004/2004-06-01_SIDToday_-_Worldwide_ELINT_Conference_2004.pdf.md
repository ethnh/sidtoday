(S) The 2004 ELINT conference attracted 400 attendees who gathered from April 19 to 23 in Denver from around the world to discuss how they will move their field forward in the face of a major mission relocation and new technological challenges. The TechSIGINT (ELINT and a few others) mission is relocating to a newly established Regional Security Operations Center (RSOC) in the Denver area (called DSOC). This dispersal of mission will afford the Intel Community some mission survivability.
(S) Mr. Richard Haver, Vice President and Director of Intelligence Programs for Northrop Grumman (and who was once appointed the first Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Policy by Dick Cheney) opened the conference with a keynote speech that vividly described the customers' use of and changing expectations for Tech SIGINT during the Iraqi situation. Presentations from CEMO, DSOC, NAIC (National Air and Space Intelligence Center), SEA SENTRY, NRO (National Reconnaissance Office), ELINT PMO (Program Management Office), STRETCHKICK, and IBS followed, to detail the current state of both operational and technical ELINT. The other three RSOCs described their largely geographically-focused missions as Regional ELINT Centers. Then the conference broke into smaller focus groups which allowed consumers to interact face-to-face with producers, enabling free sharing of ideas and concerns. The small sessions focused on:

- Maritime Tracking
- PINNACLE
- Data on Demand
- Over-the-horizon (OTH) radar
- SEI (Specific Emitter Identification)
- STRETCHKICK
- EOB (Electronic Order of Battle)
- PEOB (Parametric EOB) and GARDENVIEW
(S) The final day opened with a session on Homeland Security, moved to a DEFSMAC presentation, looked at modernizing intra-community data exchange through the E-Space initiative, and closed with Mr. Asa. A. A. A leading a panel discussion describing the seniors' view of the challenges ahead. As the attendees departed from the final briefing, they were heard declaring 2004 the "best-ever WWEC."
