(TS//SI) Where do SIGINT collectors and analysts go for information needed to access and exploit targets of interest? -- The Network Analysis Center (NAC). Today we'd like to profile one of the NAC's three divisions, namely the Advanced Network Development and Analysis (ANDA) Division.
(TS//SI) The ANDA Division brings together people with a range of skills -- Collection Managers, Computer Scientists, Engineers, Intelligence Analysts, Network Engineers and Mathematicians -- all performing Network Analysis in order to isolate and access targets within the worldwide digital network. In doing so, we use a variety of data sources, including open source data and SIGINT information such as routing protocol data. As worldwide network use has exploded, becoming the communications of choice for many targets, ANDA is called upon from various elements within both the Analysis and Production and Data Acquisition Directorates to assist with both tactical and strategic Network Analysis needs.
(TS//SI) Our work has shown concrete results. For example, ANDA played an instrumental part during the January 2004 apprehension of a key Al Qaida operative within Iraq - namely Husam al-Yemeni, aka Firas. We've assisted the Office of Regional Targets with developing a more complete understanding of the Pakistani Army Defense Network (ADN) infrastructure. We've also assisted this same office with the development of an important digital network associated with Venezuelan's leader, Victor Chavez. Regularly we assist the Office of Counterterrorism with the daily tracking of several key targets as they move throughout the worldwide digital network.
(TS//SI) Besides dealing with current operations, ANDA tries to foresee the future needs of the Directorate. For example, we have anticipatory development efforts underway in preparation for the 2004 Olympics. We're also spearheading efforts to conduct Network Analysis against special source data on the Counterterrorism target, as well as future needs of the upcoming 2004 Spring Offensive.
(TS//SI) But we're not done yet! ANDA also realizes the importance of not only tracking targets within the worldwide web, but also keeping abreast of the network technologies used by those targets. To that end, ANDA currently holds chairmanship of both the Agency's Virtual Private Network (VPN), and Wireless DNI working groups. Additionally, our Routing Protocols Working Group is working to define smart ways to infuse routing/routed protocol analysis into our mainstream Network Analysis methods.
