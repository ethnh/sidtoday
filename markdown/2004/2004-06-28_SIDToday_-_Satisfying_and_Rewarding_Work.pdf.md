Counterterrorism Product Line Staff (S2I09)
(U//FOUO) Would you jump at the chance to use your language skills to prosecute a high-profile target set that produces actionable intelligence on a regular basis? What if you were able to save lives, too? If so, read what Arabic linguist Vicky had to say about her experience in the Counterterrorism Product Line (CT):
(S//SI) Vicky is a native Arabic linguist who came to the United States from Jerusalem. After completing her university degree at the University of Maryland, Vicky worked in marketing for a while and then decided to stay home to care for her children. She did not intend to re-enter the workforce until her children were older, but the events of September 11, 2001 changed her plans.
(S//SI) With a strong desire to give back to the country that had given her so many opportunities and to support the war on terror, she applied to both the FBI and NSA, was hired by FBI first, and then transferred to NSA in July 2003. As a participant in NSA's Language Analysis New Hire Development Program, Vicky was first assigned to S2I22, the Lebanese Hizballah branch in the CT Product Line. Vicky is fluent in the Levantine and Egyptian dialects, and also understands the Saudi and Iraqi dialects.
(TS//SI) As a voice language analyst in S2I22, Vicky produces transcripts of conversations between Imad Mughniyah, notorious leader of the Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO), the terrorist wing of Lebanese Hizballah, and his inner circle. Her work on IJO's Unit 1800 has contributed to the successful disruption of terrorist operations in Israel. She has received outstanding feedback from customers, and has the immense satisfaction of knowing that her work has saved lives.
(TS//SI) In addition to her regular duties, Vicky performs quality control of transcripts and serves as a mentor to junior linguists in her branch, which she enjoys tremendously. She is very impressed with the caliber of the linguists she works with and with their dedication to the mission. She enjoys her work in CT so much that she asked for a six-month extension of her current assignment. After that, she will rotate to an office in the MENA Product Line to obtain experience working Middle Eastern diplomatic and intelligence targets. Vicky plans to return to CT after completing the development program, since serving her country by supporting the Global War on Terrorism is the reason she re-entered the workforce. Vicky finds her work in CT to be extremely rewarding--she sees the effects of her contributions on a daily basis and knows she is making a positive difference in the world.
(U//FOUO) If Vicky's experience appeals to you, come to the CT Job Fair on 30 June in 2B6008 from 1000 to 1500 to find out more about job opportunities in the CT Product Line.
