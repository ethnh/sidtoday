# (U//FOUO) New Long-Term Deployment Process 

FROM: Charles H. Berlin III
SID Chief of Staff
Run Date: 03/08/2004

FROM: Charles H. Berlin III
SID Chief of Staff
(U//FOUO) The SID leadership is proud to announce the newly established Long Term TDY Deployment Process. This new process is intended to deploy skilled personnel in a timely manner for NIST and other recurring TDY's. It will ensure that we select viable candidates far enough in advance so that the individuals can be properly trained and prepared for their deployment. The process will also assist in establishing priorities in the future, will identify funding, and will provide SID leadership with a much-needed overall picture of how many people are out of the building and what they are supporting.
(U//FOUO) This new process is very timely, as there are now more personnel being deployed on long-term TDY's (anything over 14 days but less than 129 days) than ever before. Projections are that this number will continue to grow for the foreseeable future, due to both world events and our ever-closer interaction with our customers.
(U//FOUO) A new forum will update a corporate list of recurring TDY requirements, monitor the process, and provide OIC/NCR** candidates to the SID Staff for coordination. This forum will include representatives from S1, S2, S3, SID Staff, SIG DEV, and SID SEA. Points of contact are as follows:
(U//FOUO) POCs for requirements (i.e. the entry point for any entity submitting a requirement for TDY personnel augmentation):

- SID Staff - Chief, SIGINT Support Services
- SIG DEV - Chief of Staff
- S1 - S13 Chief of Staff, Military Integration (Steve M. Hart, $\square$
- S2 - Deployment Services ( $\square$ ( $\square$ ( $\square$ nsa)
- S3 - Chief of Staff
(U//FOUO) POCs for long-term TDY deployments (the specific person to contact in your organization if you are deploying):
- SID Staff -
- SIG DEV - George Mohnasky
- S1 -

(U) Hostile areas POC :
(U//FOUO) The above identifies the SID person to contact, but in addition Human Resources has responsibility to prepare and deploy those going to hostile areas. Therefore, in addition to the SID POC, please contact Debbie Rhyne $\square$ in the HR Deployment Center.
(U//FOUO) If you deploy on a frequent basis or believe that you might volunteer or be asked to deploy in the near future, please review the Hostile Area Deployment Center's Pre-deployment Mandatory Processing Checklist (via a link at the top of the left column on their webpage). These guidelines will help you to be prepared both personally and professionally well in advance.
