(U) What's a JIOPO (pronounced JI-O-PO)?
FROM:
NSA's JIOPO Program Manager (S2K04)
Run Date: 12/08/2004

New office to improve the Intel Community's performance on Computer Network Operations (S//SI)
(S//SI) No, it's not a new Mexican food. It's the Joint Information Operations Program Office (JIOPO) established by the FY2003-2007 Intelligence Program Decision Memorandum. The JIOPO was created to enable the Intelligence Community (IC) to better carry out the Information Operations (IO) mission and IO-related activities. Its current focus is to address the number one gap in IO --- cyber threat indications \& warning (I\&W). The JIOPO is staffed by a small team from NSA, CIA and DIA.
(S//SI) The NSA JIOPO Program Manager, hosted within the Office of Information Operations (S2K), is embarking on a multi-pronged approach to help improve the agency's posture and performance of IO. This will include:

- Launching an outreach program, to include forums, working groups, and conference information;
- Assessing our baseline capabilities -- a cyber threat Indications \& Warning capability baseline study is already underway;
- Making resources available to advance community cyber threat capabilities;
- Creating Intelink and NSAweb pages with ESS capabilities to keep you informed of the lasted JIOPO news.
(S//SI) Are you excited by the opportunity to help NSA create more IO successes with our CIA and DIA counterparts? If you want to help solve real-world problems as part of a collaborative IC effort, check out the JIOPO homepage at
