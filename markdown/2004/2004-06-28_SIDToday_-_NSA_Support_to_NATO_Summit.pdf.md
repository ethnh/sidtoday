(S) The NATO Summit in Istanbul, 28-29 June 2004, is the last of the three summits in June (G8, US-European Union, and NATO) where the major US international security initiatives will be discussed with our closest allies. Interest in this event is heightened by the participation of the U.S. President, George Bush in the Summit itself, preceded by a two-day visit to Ankara on 2627 June. Since early May, NSA has been working at Headquarters, throughout the extended enterprise and in close cooperation with foreign partners to provide security for this event.

# (S) High Terrorist Threat Potential for this Summit, in a Summer of Many High Profile Events... 

(S) The Summit will be a high profile event with close to 60 heads of state -- including the President -- and their chief military and foreign policy advisers attending. The bombings in Istanbul in November, March and May, and in Madrid in March, plus the discovery of several bombs on train tracks in Spain and France in March, and significant terrorist threats against Turkey make the security environment for the Summit a great concern. Some people are referring to the Summit as a potential terrorist "Superbowl" and the Director of Central Intelligence has raised the level of community focus for this event. Recent raids in the vicinity of Istanbul by the Turkish National Police -- allegedly targeting groups with connections to Sunni extremist groups planning to attack or disrupt the Summit -- have raised security concerns even higher.

## (U) From What Terrorist Groups Will the Primary Threat Come?

(S) Terrorist groups would consider the NATO Summit a hard target. Security around the Summit venues would probably preclude any serious terrorist targeting of the immediate Summit facilities during the event. However, terrorists would regard the Summit as a lucrative target because the large number of world leaders attending and the symbolism that NATO evokes would automatically turn any terrorist act into a dramatic event embarrassing the Turkish government.
(S) The US Intelligence Community assesses the greatest threat to the Summit comes from Al Qa'ida and its affiliates or sympathetic Islamic groups. Other potential terrorist groups posing a medium-to-high level threat are Ansar al-Islam and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). A secondary threat is posed by Domestic Turkish extremist groups including the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C), the Maoist Communist Party (MKP, formerly the Turkish Communist Party/Marxist Leninist, TKP/ML), Kongra Gel (formerly Kadek/PKK) and Turkish Hisballah. National or international anti-global, anarchist type groups, such as Great Eastern Raiders-Front, pose a less serious threat that is likely to be disruptive rather than destructive. There is also the "wild card" possibility of an attack from unknown terrorists, taking advantage of this world stage opportunity.

## (S//SI) NSA and Intelligence Community Support on the Ground in Istanbul

(S//SI) To meet the challenge in Istanbul,

- NSA has supplied four senior SIGINT analysts -- two from Headquarters and two from NCEUR* -- to work in the US Fusion Cell, led by CIA and located in the New US Consulate building.
- NCR $\square$ NSA's Senior Representative in country, will be working with CIA Chief of Station Ankara and Chief of Base Istanbul and with Turkish and NATO partners as part of a multi-national International Intelligence Group, located at Turkish National Intelligence Organization (TNIO) office near the Summit Hall.
- An Executive Protection Team, located at the Hilton Hotel in Istanbul, where the US President will be located, will be working in close cooperation with the Special Collection Service (SCS). NSA has augmented the Special Collection Service effort with four additional linguists. GCHQ is also supporting SCS efforts with a special short-term effort in Istanbul.
- Finally, a technical support team from SID Data Acquisition (DA) will be on-site in Ankara and Istanbul to provide assistance.


# (U) NSA Support Efforts at Headquarters 

(S//SI) Back at Headquarters, analysts from several production offices and current support offices are working extended hours to provide quick detection of any terrorist threat against the NATO Summit. Counterterrorism, International Security Issues (ISI) and the GEO Product Line have all stood up 24/7 watch efforts for the duration of the Summit. NSOC's Campaign Desk, Terrorism Desk the CT Watch Officer and the Executive Protection Center are all geared up for crisis support.
(S//SI) Advance support and preparation for the Summit has been provided by a virtual SIGINT Development Working Group, including members from CT, GEO and ISI offices, GRSOC*, MRSOC*, NCEUR Forward and military personnel from ESC*, has been under way for several month, resulting in an excellent baseline of knowledge and some significant new development against terrorist communications in the Istanbul area. The Europe Issue Management Team (IMT) has also been working to provide synchronization of SIGINT support related to the NATO Summit. All are poised and ready to support a safe and successful summit or to respond in real-time if needed.
