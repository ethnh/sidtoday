(S//SI) China is poised to join Russia as the next country to pose a mobile ICBM threat to the United States. After two decades of development, China's Dongfeng-31 (East Wind-31 or DF-31) is on the verge of batch production. While this 8000-kilometer range missile cannot target the continental United States, the DF-31 will, however, be capable of striking targets from Moscow to Alaska. The follow-on missile, the DF-31A, will have the range to target the entire United States.
(S//SI) This 12,000-14,000 kilometer range missile has had two successful flight tests, and further testing is expected.
Accompanying the development of these land-based missiles is that of the Julang-2 (Great Wave-2 or JL-2) submarine launched ballistic missile. The DF-31 ICBM is likely serving as a technology bridge for both the DF-31A and JL-2 programs.
(S//SI) Although China will not produce mobile ICBMs in the quantity Russia has, China is seeking to establish a credible and survivable nuclear deterrent, and will likely adhere to its longstanding "no first use" policy. The current ICBM system in China that can target the United States, the DF-5A, is a liquid propellant system based in silos. These missiles are considered vulnerable to attack and less survivable than a mobile system.
(S//SI) Assessments vary regarding the status of the various Chinese mobile ICBM programs due to different readings of available intelligence. However, most analysts believe the DF-31 ICBM will be deployed in limited numbers in the next few years, followed shortly thereafter by the more capable DF-31A ICBM. The launch platform for the JL-2 SLBM, the 094-class nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine, is currently under construction. We expect that the JL-2 SLBM will be deployed by the end of the decade.
(S//SI) China has invested heavily in recent years to build up an infrastructure to support its mobile ICBM program. New facilities for solid rocket motor production, general assembly, flight testing, and deployment have been completed or are still under construction. China is clearly establishing an infrastructure for long term and sustainable mobile ICBM production that promises to be a continued source of concern to the Intelligence Community.
