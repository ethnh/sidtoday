# (U//FOUO) New Commander at NASIC 

FROM:
NASIC Account Manager (S112)
Run Date: 10/14/2004
"I accept this command..."
(U//FOUO) With these words, the command of the National Air and Space Intelligence Center passed from Col Mark Christian to Col Joseph Pridotkas on 01 September 2004.
(U//FOUO) Located on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, northeast of Dayton, Ohio, the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), a subordinate command of the Air Intelligence Agency (AIA) and a principal subordinate unit of the Air Combat Command (ACC), is the Air Force's single intelligence production center and the primary Department of Defense (DoD) producer of foreign air and space intelligence.
(U//FOUO) The NASIC team exploits all-source intelligence to assess current and projected foreign forces, weapon system capabilities, and employment techniques. NASIC products and services play a key role in ensuring that American forces are fully informed of the capabilities of foreign air and space forces and can counter the threats they pose. NASIC is interested in any significant foreign political or economic developments because of their technological ramifications and their importance for NASIC's predictive studies. In addition, NASIC develops targeting and mission-planning intelligence materials.
(U/FOUO) In recent years, the mission of NASIC has expanded to accommodate new global realities and to better position that organization to service the needs of a broader and more diverse customer set.
(C) NASIC is organized into eight directorates. Five of the directorates have daily contact with NSA:

- the Air and Electronics Systems Directorate (AE), responsible for performing aerodynamic weapon systems analysis;
- the Battlespace Production (BP) Directorate, which includes behavioral influences analysis, air capabilities evaluation, integration applications, and denial and deception;
- the Data Exploitation (DE) Directorate, responsible for a significant role in technical SIGINT weapons exploitation, as well as IMINT, MASINT and foreign materiel exploitation, information needs management and a significant community weapons processing center;
- the Global Threat (GT) Directorate, which includes C4/IO, futures, integrated air defense systems and strategic technologies and warning;
- and the Space and Missiles (SM) Directorate responsible for broad aspects of space and ballistic missile technology.
(C) NASIC, known previously as the National Air Intelligence Center, (NAIC) and the Foreign Technology Division (FTD), has been served almost continuously by an NSA/CSS Representative (NCR) since 1985. The current NCR, represents the Director of NSA (DIRNSA) and is the forward deployed member of a Customer Relationships Team positioned to help manage the NSA/NASIC relationship. Other members of this team are the Senior Executive Account Manager, Capt $\square$ USN of S333, and the Account Manager, S112. These three represent the point of the spear in the mission to make the relationship between NSA and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center a healthy and productive one.
(U//FOUO) As Col Pridotkas takes the reins of NASIC and begins to guide it through the next phase of its life, the Customer Relations Team will partner with him and his Center to help him
achieve the successful satisfaction of NASIC's important mission.
