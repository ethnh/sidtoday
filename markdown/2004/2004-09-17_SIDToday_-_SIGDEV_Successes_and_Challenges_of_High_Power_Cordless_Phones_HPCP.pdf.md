(U) SIGDEV Successes and Challenges of High Power Cordless Phones (HPCP)

(C) HPCP, also known as Long Range Cordless Telephone (LRCT) is an inexpensive and versatile technology sometimes referred to as "the poor man's cellular". It can be used to establish standalone networks, or to connect to a traditional public phone system via a standard PSTN* line. HPCPs operate in FM mode in the VHF/UHF frequency ranges from 30Mhz - 930Mhz; transmit voice, data, and fax traffic; and have impressive line-of-site ranges of from 5 to 150 kilometers. In light of this, it is easy to understand why HPCP usage is rapidly increasing throughout the world.
(C) Use of HPCP technology by the global community was initially found in the environment by RAINFALL in 1998. In May 2001, a large number of HPCP phones were sold in Iraq, which was validated through collection and survey efforts, thereby making it high-value exploitation for NSA.
(S//SI) SIGINT Development (SIGDEV) Strategy \& Governance (SSG) created the HAC in May 2003 to further the understanding of worldwide HPCP technology to enhance ongoing HPCP SIGDEV efforts across the extended enterprise. The HAC's unique roles as a Center of Excellence include, but are not limited to:

- HPCP trend analysis,
- consolidation and sharing of corporate HPCP knowledge,
- coordination of HPCP SIGDEV,
- analytical tool development and training, and the
- development of general knowledge about HPCP communications.

HAC analysts also provide geolocational, network, and dialing analysis of HPCP metadata in support of target development on a worldwide basis.
(S//SI) A HAC analyst conducting HPCP trend analysis saw the deteriorating political situation on the ground in Haiti and initiated a baseline study of HPCP activity in there in early February 2004. He started by conducting a seven-day data pull of all HPCP Base Stations geolocated in Haiti from the SIGINT Emitter Database (SEDB). Out of this pool of emitters, he conducted call chaining on those with the heaviest call volume. He identified Base Station B3A8 operating in Jacmel, Haiti, a suspected drug lord-controlled town, in contact with Haitian interim President Boniface Alexander and the Interior Ministry's Zero Tolerance team. This data was immediately passed to the Latin America and Caribbean Division (S2A3), which submitted a request for overhead collection of the HPCP base station in Jacmel and the phone numbers tied to the government ministries. S2A3 also asked for further assistance from the HAC for continued SIGDEV support of the target.
(S//SI) HAC analysts have been to SOUTHCOM HQs to brief the J2* as to the necessity of HPCP exploitation in the Latin American Area of Responsibility (AOR), specifically Colombia. Current HAC projects also include tracking HPCP activity within the Sunni Triangle (specifically Baqubah, Habbaniyah, Ar Ramadi, and Al Fallujah) and providing CENTCOM an HPCP baseline for all HPCP activity that may be IED*-related along Highway 10 between Ar Ramadi and Baghdad in support of the Global War On Terror.
(S//SI) There are currently more than 340 different models of HPCP in use throughout the world. Collecting, identifying, and exploiting them is, and will continue to be, a real challenge to the NSA.
