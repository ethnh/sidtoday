# (U) A\&P Personnel Processes 

FROM: Jim Allen
SID Deputy Director for Analysis and Production (S2)
Run Date: 02/17/2004

FROM: Jim Allen
SID Deputy Director for Analysis and Production (S2)
(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: Jim Allen sent the below message to the S2 workforce on February 6th:
(U//FOUO) In late February, we will convene our first Career Development Board (CDB), to be chaired by
our Chief of Staff. Its purpose is to provide a mechanism to enhance the orgnization's ability to get the right people in the right places, to help us take maximum advantage of developmental opportunities for our people, and to help advance the career aspirations of our people. The CDB will consider all GG-15's and those GG-14's who are in GG-15 level positions. It will make recommendations to me; I will make the decisions.
(U//FOUO) I would like to include all GG-14's in the future, but the size of our population makes that untenable now. The CDB is not our only mechanism for working personnel issues. Indeed, especially initially, it will likely provide a relatively small but important adjunct to existing processes such as vacancy announcements. My hope is that we will be able to get the CDB in good enough form to be able to assist in assimilating field returnees later this year.
(U//FOUO) Also coming soon is the next round of the promotion process. It is almost certain to be the last conducted under the current process, which will be superseded by changes in our HR programs later this year and next. I urge each of you to update your Internal Staffing Resume and to prepare a Promotion Review Package. That package will be due to your first line supervisor on 8 March. The June 04 A\&P Promotion Process and Promotion Timeline are available off the A\&P web page at the following url:
(U//FOUO) Also available at that web site are guidelines for the Language Analysis and Intelligence Analysis Skill Communities. These guidelines do not represent separate promotion criteria, but simply provide examples of accomplishments against the standard Agency criteria for promotion in the LA and IA skill communities. For your convenience, you can link to both the SID Promotion web page and the HRS promotion web page from the A\&P web site. If you have questions related to the FY04 promotion process, please contact the team of
(U//FOUO) As you know, the Director has addressed the new Compensation Reform in an email and in a recent session on Talk NSA. I want to let you know that both SID and A\&P are fully engaged in this process and that we will be working very closely with HR thoughout this next year in transitioning to the new personnel system at the Agency. We will provide additional information to you as it becomes available. For an overview of the new personnel system, please type "go comp reform." For specific questions, send an e-mail to "ASK _COMPREFORM."
(U//FOUO) Changes in personnel-related processes naturally create a great deal of anxiety, but I am confident that these changes will benefit the A\&P civilians affected by them.

V/R - Jim
