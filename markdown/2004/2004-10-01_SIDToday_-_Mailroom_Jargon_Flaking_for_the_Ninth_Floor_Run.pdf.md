- "playpens" : huge short square bins that held heavy items from the print shop or telephone books.
- "controlled" item : a piece of mail that needed a signature
- "sacks" : colored bags that the 2nd Party entities used to transport their mail to NSA
- "9th floor run" : the hourly hand-delivery of mail to the Director's floor (i.e. the 9th floor of HQS)
- "P3-SOO" : a special package that used to arrive from the Pentagon every day
- "in the tunnel" : the subfloor where mailroom employees had to go if mail between the main mail center at the south loading dock fell off the conveyor belt going to the 2 nd floor mail center.
- "tube" : means by which special messages were sent to the NSOC message center (then T113) via the pneumatic tube system
