(U//FOUO) If your answer to that question is "CREST, of course" you can skip the rest of this article. If your answer is -- "What are you talking about, they haven't gone anywhere, they are in my SEMESTER," -- you'd better read on! SEMESTER is going away.
(U//FOUO) It's OK, you don't need to panic. All of those transcripts can be moved into CREST, the new Agency historical transcript repository. We won't even make you go through and hand-mark each and every one of them for release (although it is tempting)! Please contact the CREST team (go crest) to find out more about the new system. SEMESTER PM @insa) can work with you to automatically bulk release transcripts which have never been released from your SEMESTER system.
(U//FOUO) Now, speaking of transcripts ... Do you know of any transcripts out there that are in neither CREST (having been moved from the ADB and AQUILINE) nor SEMESTER? Maybe someone you know was transcribing in the comment field on the hybrid (we are sure it wasn't you!). Or maybe someone has been transcribing into flat files? If you know of any transcripts like this we would appreciate it if you would contact the CREST team to begin the process of getting those transcripts into the new system. Our goal is to make CREST the one place to go to find transcripts, and to do that we need to gather transcripts from wherever they currently are.
(U//FOUO) If you have questions on how all of these pieces are working, or if this article has just served to confuse you, contact the Voice Processing Program Manager @insa or the Voice Processing Tech Lead @insa, If you want to learn more about CREST just hit that CREST website - go crest!
