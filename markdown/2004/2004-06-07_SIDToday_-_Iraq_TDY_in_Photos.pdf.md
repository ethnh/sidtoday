(S) A group of SIGINT'ers travelled to Iraq from April 5 through 9 to hold discussions with customers and NSA personnel in-country. The group consisted of Rob Joyce of the Iraq Issue Managers Team (IMT), COL Rob Carr, commander of the GRSOC, and , chief, Iraq/Arabian Peninsula Division (S2E2). To give a sense of conditions in Iraq, we are posting pictures of their journey below. Thanks to for the photos and captions!

## first $C-130$ flight. A little nervous perhaps?

Travel between the various "Green Zones" was rather harrowing as the driver reached speeds of nearly 100 mph to avoid possible gunfire. Occasional round-abouts and checkpoints sometimes slowed things down.

Home, sweet home. and Rob Joyce arrive at the "entrance" to the trailers that were to be their accommodations in Baghdad. The trailers are surrounded by sandbag walls to reduce the risk from mortar hits.

The front entrance to a former palace in downtown Baghdad that now houses the Coalition Provisional Authority. It's where Ambassador Bremer and CPA members work - along with NCR Baghdad.

Tents for soldiers at Camp Victory, 10 miles outside downtown Baghdad.

MG Barbara Fast's office is located in this palace at Camp Victory. The lake is manmade, and Saddam's son, Uday, reportedly water-skied here. (Note: MG Fast is the C2 (Director of Intelligence) of CJTF-7 (Coalition Joint Task Force), which has operational command of all combatant units in Iraq.)

On the last night, the TDY'ers had slightly more upscale accommodations. Many of the furnishings from Saddam's regime were still there; however, the luxurious surroundings did not fully muffle the sound of explosions at night...
