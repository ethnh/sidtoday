(U//FOUO) Today, the SID Visits team will begin user-testing of a new tool designed to support the visit coordination process. The testing is part of a pilot effort in the Customer Relationships Directorate to test commercial Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools in SID.
(U//FOUO) Customer Gateway and Customer Response have worked diligently since early October 2003 to implement Siebel, industry's leading CRM software. The tool, which has not been given a fancy or technical cover name, will facilitate the coordination, tracking, and reporting of SID visits as never before. Operational testing will begin upon completion of associated system security processes.
