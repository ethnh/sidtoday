(S//SI) Last month, MG Quirk signed into effect USSID 430, the first SID-level policy governing SIGINT support to Information Operations (IO). IO is defined as "Actions taken to affect adversary information and information systems while defending one's own information and information systems." In recent years, IO has become a large and growing mission for the SIGINT Enterprise: it is an area that affects most SIGINT product lines.
(S//SI) Furthermore, all three SID Deputy Directorates have organizations that are fully dedicated to IO, such as:

- The Information Warfare Support Center (S15) in the Customer Relationships Directorate,
- SIGINT Support to IO (S2K) in Analysis \& Production, and
- Tailored Access Operations (S32) in Data Acquisition.
...Add to this the efforts of the Extended Enterprise and our interaction with the IO Technology Center (IOTC), and you can see that IO is a major part of the SIGINT business.
(S//SI) USSID 430 represents a much-needed overall SID policy for this burgeoning field. It complements SID's pre-existing " Policy \& Guidance on Reporting Digital Network Intelligence Communications." (CR-365-01), and relates SID policies with established DoD and DCI directives.
(U//FOUO) You can access USSID 430 in Webworld . If you have questions about the new policy, please contact the SIGINT Policy Staff at DL SID_POLICY or
