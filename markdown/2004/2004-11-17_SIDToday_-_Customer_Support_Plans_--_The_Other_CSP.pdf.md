(U//FOUO) Customer Support Plans -- The Other CSP
FROM:
Deputy Chief, Customer Account Management (S112)
Run Date: 11/17/2004

New CSPs detail what SID will do to support particular customers' needs; updated annually (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) When you hear the acronym CSP, most think about the Cryptologic Support Plans (see related article ) that describe how NSA will support a given military operation. Now, however, "CSP" can also refer to a new customer engagement vehicle being developed in S11 (Customer Gateway), namely the Customer Support Plan. The S11 CSP is a service-level contract for products and services between SID and its customers. The plan documents strategic intelligence needs, the required level of SIGINT service, and a description of the customer information space. It also includes an action plan that lays out the necessary steps for improved services and support.
(U//FOUO) These CSPs are developed using the SCORECARD process. Here's how it works: the Customer SCORECARD is a series of personal interviews (it is not a survey!) conducted by NCRs/SEAMs* and/or Account Managers within a customer set. The interview questions are standardized for all 50-plus customers and include both numerical evaluations of how well we are meeting customer needs, and open-ended questions about customer strategic direction and their "NSA wish list." SCORECARD data is then compiled into action plans and codified in the CSP.
(U//FOUO) The CSP action plans are vetted with Target Offices of Primary Interest (TOPIs) and key enablers to determine areas where we can improve our support, and to also determine issues for which NSA will not be able to provide help to our customers. A completed CSP is then communicated back to the customer as the "service level contract" for the next 12 months. Data used in this process is also available to the corporation to make strategic mission and resource decisions.
