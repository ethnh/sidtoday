- (S//SI) "What technologies are our SIGINT intelligence targets using today and what will they use three years from now?"
(S//SI) That's the question that the SIGNT Development Target Technology Trends Center (T3C, a.k.a. S3TSD) answers to help posture SID against strategic surprise. We rely heavily on the expertise of A\&P target offices, DA technologists, private industry and academia as we track the indicators of change in the current and planned usage of technologies by our targets. The stronger the target evidence, the more certain SID is that its technology developments and investments are on track.
(U//FOUO) Our primary deliverable is a Top 10 List of Target Technologies which helps drive SID's budget builds and investment portfolio. It is a living list and we are always looking for expert input. Please visit our web site ("go t3c") to comment on our list and view our other products.
- (U//FOUO) "How do you scale the T3 process to cover the broad spectrum of targets and technologies of concern to SID?"
(U//FOUO) As a SIGNT Development center, we're developing the "how to" for trends analysis and building a knowledge-based system to support the maintenance and improvement of the Top 10 List. We're drawing upon existing Agency solutions for the base capability and adding in competitive intelligence techniques and tools to mine the Internet and visually display the results for analysts.
(U//FOUO) We have billets and want to grow our center with talented, can-do people. If you want to join the T3C, please contact us at $\square$ @nsa.
