(U//FOUO) An Open House for SID shiftworkers was held on December 11th from 2200-2400, hosted by the SIGINT People Office/Workforce Advocacy Team, SID Chief of Staff Charles Berlin, and one highly motivated SID new hire.
(U//FOUO) The Open House provided an opportunity for employees who work alternate work schedules to create a network with fellow shiftworkers, to meet and talk to the SID Chief of Staff, and to share feedback and ideas with the Workforce Advocacy Team. The response to the Open House was very positive. Over forty employees attended. The Workforce Advocacy Team plans to offer similar opportunities and activities through 2004.
