(U//FOUO) New Office Now Handling Cryptologic Services Group (CSG) Support

FROM: Col Keith Pavlischek, USMC Military Affairs Special Assistant, Customer Gateway (S11) Run Date: 02/12/2004

FROM: Col Keith Pavlischek, USMC Military Affairs Special Assistant, Customer Gateway (S11)
(U//FOUO) Customer Gateway (S11) is the organization within the Customer Relationships Directorate that acts as the entry point for external customers seeking tailored products and services from the Signals Intelligence Directorate. As part of transforming Customer Relationships, Customer Gateway assumed responsibility for providing support to the Cryptologic Services Groups (CSGs) in October 2003.
(U//FOUO) This shift in responsibility from the previous mission element, Military Integration Office (S13), will now allow the Military Integration Office to focus all its energy on providing support to crisis operations and exercise planning. This move, moreover, reflected a logical realignment of our most forward customer support organizations (CSGs) with the customer Account Manager (AM) and Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM) programs which also reside in Customer Gateway.
(U//FOUO) A new CSG and Customer Visits Support branch within Customer Gateway has been established to provide direct support to the CSGs. Critical functions include IT support (including the management of Sun to NT migration), responsibility for CSG personnel management and training, and planning and executing the worldwide CSG conference. Military Integration's Military Support Officers (MSOs) will continue to provide planning and operational support to the CSGs and will continue to recruit, train, deploy, and support personnel deployed to the forward operational areas. In addition, Military Integration will remain the lead organization for National Intelligence Support Team (NIST) support as well as support for those "CSGs" that have evolved from NISTs or other NSA support to crisis operations. For USCENTCOM's area of responsibility (AOR), for example, this means that the manning, logistical and planning support for NSA personnel at Bagram, Kabul, Baghdad and Horn of Africa (HOA) will continue to be supported by Military Integration.
(U//FOUO) The successes of the transition to date include:

- Planning has begun for the first Worldwide CSG conference in several years, which will be held at NSAW Headquarters on May 12-14, 2004.
- A new three-year plan to upgrade the CSG IT desktop systems is in place. One third (13 locations) of the CSGs will be upgraded (and converted from SUN to NT at most CSGs) in each of the next three years. This represents the first upgrades to the CSG architecture in several years. The plan has been funded and implemented - CSG Pentagon was successfully upgraded in December 2003.
- FY04 CSG requirements for travel, equipment and supplies have been collected and totaled. Funding has been identified to fulfill a large majority of the these needs; current year is above average with respect to funding due to supplemental funding to support OIF. A "working allocation" has been determined for each CSG that the NCR/ CSG Chief can manage.
- A needs assessment for training has been conducted and, in conjunction with the National Cryptologic School, we have begun coordinating a baseline training plan for all CSG personnel.
(U//FOUO) The CSG and Customer Visits Support Staff is located in OPS 2A, Room 2A0614. The newly appointed branch chief is Mr. . This staff's most immediate tasks include: reviewing billets and funding required to support the CSGs in order to identify and rectify the most pressing manning issues and shortfalls; planning and implementing an enhanced training program for newly assigned CSG personnel; and identifying responsibilities that reside within
other SID organizations.
