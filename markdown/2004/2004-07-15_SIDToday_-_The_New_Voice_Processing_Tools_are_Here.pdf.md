(U//FOUO) Are you still processing your voice data with HYBRID, ROSECROSS and SEMESTER ? Are you aware that all voice linguists will be transitioning to the New Voice Architecture (NUCLEON, BEAMER, HOTZONE )? The new voice tools are being rolled out on a large scale as part of SID Desktop Modernization, along with new working aids and dictionaries. If you haven't started the transition process yet, please check it out as soon as possible on the New Voice Architecture website (go nvat).
(C) The New Voice Architecture provides a number of benefits to the analyst including:

- platform independent user interfaces,
- full-text indexing of transcripts in all states,
- graphic data stored in NUCLEON (you can now query on the metadata),
- full-text indexing of graphic OCR* data,
- multilingual support for transcription,
- spell check,
- 30-day default retention of untouched data, and
- 5-year default retention of metadata.
(U//FOUO) Our team prides itself on customer focus. We provide a full-service transition shop, including classroom training, in-office follow-up training, and system engineers to help work out your unique issues. We consider our customers to be our primary application designers -- continuous improvement of our tools is directly attributable to prompt integration of user feedback.
(U//FOUO) If you have questions about Desktop Modernization, send an email to DL SDM_PM (NT) or $\square$ Bnsa.
