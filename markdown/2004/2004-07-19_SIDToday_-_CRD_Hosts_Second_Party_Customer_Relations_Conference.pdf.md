(U//FOUO) CRD Hosts Second Party Customer Relations Conference
FROM: Customer Gateway (S11) Chief of Staff
Run Date: 07/19/2004
(TS//SI) Recently S1, the Customer Relationships Directorate, and S11, Customer Gateway, hosted the first-ever Second Party Customer Relations Conference. The conference was held on 2-4 June, and included eleven guests from our four Second Party partners, as well as five of their on-site Liaison Officers. The theme of the conference was "Customer Relations: Different Perspectives, Same Goal", and the conference was the second new 2nd Party partner initiative launched this year geared toward creating the Global SIGINT Community envisioned in the 2nd Party Business Vision .
(TS//SI) Earlier this year, CRD's Customer Gateway kicked off a Second Party Information Needs Exchange Working Group, which meets bi-monthly to discuss and negotiate the level of Information Needs (IN) exchange needed by each partner. Based on the group's discussions, it became apparent that the Second Party Community needed to move beyond simply exchanging INs, and begin collaborating on a much broader range of Customer issues. Thus the idea of the Second Party Conference was born, and based on its overwhelming success, look for it to be an annual event.
(S) Mr. Charlie Meals, SID Deputy Director, opened the conference on Wednesday morning, welcoming our guests and laying the groundwork for three days of information exchange, networking, and future planning. Each of the eleven Second Party* guests presented briefings outlining Customer Relations Management (CRM) best practices, to include successes and challenges. These were followed by several NSA presentations, including a National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) overview, a Customer Information Needs Response (CINR) update, a Customer SCORECARD briefing co-presented with GCHQ, and a Customer Feedback Sharing briefing. To balance the government CRM perspective, two speakers from private industry briefed the audience to provide the corporate focus.
(S) The second half of the conference was spent generating and prioritizing CRM initiatives of highest interest, and then breaking into mixed-group sessions to generate action plans on the top three initiatives. Social and networking opportunities included a reception at the National Cryptologic Museum on Wednesday evening, hosted by our Second Party guests, and dinner at The King's Contrivance Restaurant on Thursday evening, hosted by Mr. Gary Grantham, Principal Director, Foreign Affairs Directorate.
(S) On Friday morning, the groups briefed the SID Leadership team on their findings and action plans on three projects, to be worked jointly by 5-Eyes teams over the coming year. These projects are: Information Needs Exchange, Sharing Customer Feedback, and Creating and Fostering a 5-Eyes Customer Service Community to Satisfy Customer Needs. Finally, Deputy Director, Customer Relationships Directorate, closed the conference on Friday afternoon.
(U//FOUO) In addition to our Second Party guests, a number of SID personnel also attended all, or part of, the conference. These attendees became active conference participants, and contributed significantly to the breakout sessions and final action briefings. The conference venue was small by design, with an average daily attendance of about 40 people. This smaller, working-group type of atmosphere helped organizers achieve a friendly, collaborative, and interactive setting which, according to our guests, was one of the highlights of the conference. Other post-conference feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and the participants unanimously agreed that this inaugural Second Party Customer Relations Conference would serve as the impetus for an annual event.
