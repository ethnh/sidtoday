(U//FOUO) Where in the world is Carmen San Diego?? Where
would we start the search? What kind of information should we
collect? From what sources? We can't search everywhere and just
hope we trip over the right data.
(U//FOUO) Understanding and analyzing a targeted network is currently a labor-intensive process in which network analysts pore through various data sources using a subset of semi-automated tools. We simply do not have enough network analysts to effectively monitor these targeted networks while continuing to work newly developed or less understood protocols.
(S//SI) The answer is to integrate an automated functionality to perform this work. To that end, a prototype development effort is underway to establish the Data/Network Operations Center (DNOC) within the Network Analysis Center (NAC) to construct and monitor change on targeted networks. A development team comprised of experts from industry, government, and academia are collaborating on this enormous systems integration effort. Their success will be dependent upon cooperation external to the NAC.
(S//SI) Therefore, an Integrated Product Team (IPT) has been established and is supported by over 60 representatives from over 30 organizations throughout SID. These individuals are contributing to the development effort by raising both technical and environmental issues, escalating those issues, and recommending work-arounds and/or long-term solutions. A concept of operations is due out in mid-March and the Spiral 1 prototype is scheduled for June 2004. For additional information, visit our DNOC homepage .
