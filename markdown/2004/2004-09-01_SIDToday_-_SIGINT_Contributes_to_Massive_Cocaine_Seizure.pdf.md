(S//SI) On 12 July 2004, International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT) collection and geolocation systems (SEADIVER and CANYONDUST ) contributed to the largest Eastern Atlantic seizure of cocaine made possible by SIGINT. First, British cryptologists at GCHQ successfully broke encrypted faxes from the vessel's INMARSAT terminal, the "Africa 1". This intercept identified the ship as a smuggler. Next, the ship was geolocated by CANYONDUST and the coordinates were passed to Spanish Customs for interdiction.
(S//SI) A total of 5.4 tons of cocaine with a United Kingdom street value of 378 million pounds ( $\sim \$ 689$ M USD) was seized. Four Greek and one Italian crew members were arrested, and three additional arrests were made in Greece. Operations continue to locate the principal Greek target, to identify additional vessels associated with the organization, and to identify links with South America.
