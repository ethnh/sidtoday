(U//FOUO) When I submitted my name for an opportunity to shadow a SIGINT Leader for the day, I had no idea that I would be selected to shadow the SIGINT Director, MG Quirk. Spending the day with MG Quirk was an inspiring and eye-opening experience. Collaboration, flexibility, and communications were the key essential elements of every meeting I attended. I will expound on a few of the meetings, to give you a sense of the day's activities.
(U//FOUO) The financial execution meeting with $\square$ and SID Leadership covered the hard work involved in developing plans to meet the accelerated obligation and outlay rates. The hard work and dedication to meet execution expectations resulted in very little money pulled from Expenditure Centers to fund shortfalls. Executing funds is just as important as receiving them.
(S) Another interesting meeting involved a briefing from a joint partnership between NSA and CIA. Listening to the challenges and success stories of hard working civilian and military personnel on the ground with military forces in Iraq was captivating. We don't hear about them on the news, but they are there in the shadows producing SIGINT for commanders. Personnel in the field appreciate our support and quick response to their requirements. We are definitely one of the critical lifelines to the war fighter.
(S) The final meeting I will expound on was a senior level all-hands meeting that included military and civilian leadership from across the enterprise. They discussed military field command problems with timely SIGINT delivery and database access. Today, some brigade-level SIGINTers are experiencing difficulties accessing critical SIGINT because of antiquated processes, databases, and network infrastructure. The problem was not solved during the session, but the right people took away actions to help generate a prompt suitable solution.
(U//FOUO) The shadowing program is an excellent opportunity to see leadership in action and learn how your contribution fits into the grand scheme. I want to personally thank MG Quirk, $\square$, $\square$, Lt Col $\square$ and TSgt $\square$ for their hospitality and making me feel like a part of the team.
(U) I had a great time!!!
