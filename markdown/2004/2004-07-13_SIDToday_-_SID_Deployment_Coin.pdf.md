# (U//FOUO) SID Deployment Coin 

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA Signals Intelligence Director Run Date: 07/13/2004
(U//FOUO) I have established a SID Deployment Coin for NSA/CSS personnel who deployed in support of the SID mission since 9/11/01. The SID Deployment Coin is in recognition of the exemplary service and performance of the men and women of the NSA/CSS who have deployed overseas in support of SID in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). They have displayed superior technical skill, dedication to the mission, and extraordinary professionalism in providing actionable intelligence to the warfighter.
(U//FOUO) Who will be awarded a SID Deployment Coin? The criteria are as follows: If you are an NSA/CSS civilian or military personnel who were deployed overseas to a hazardous location in support of the SID organization on official orders for at least a 30-day period (since 9/11/01), you are authorized to receive the SID Deployment Coin. The SID Deployment Coin will be presented to SID personnel deployed to dangerous/hostile locations within the US CENTCOM AOR; however, enabler personnel and other geographical areas may be eligible based on a case-by-case decision by me or an official designated by me.
(U//FOUO) On 27 July, I will conduct the first ceremony in the Friedman Auditorium to present SID Deployment coins to those who have returned between 1 January and 31 May 2004. The number of people who are invited to this ceremony totals approximately 85 civilians and military members. We are currently working to establish a list of those who deployed and returned between 9/11/01 and 12/31/03. Those individuals will receive their coin through their chain of command. Those SIGINT'ers who deployed from one of the RSOCs, or a mission ground station, or any other part of the extended enterprise, will also receive their coin through their chains of command. (0) the SID Senior Enlisted Advisor, is responsible for locating military members who have changed duty locations since their TDY.
(U//FOUO) Future ceremonies will be conducted quarterly to present SID Deployment Coins to those who have completed their deployment since the last ceremony, and coins will continue to be supplied to the extended enterprise for presentation. Those eligible to receive the coin who have not been contacted by 1 September 2004 should send an email to "DL POST ITS" (or @nsa); include your name, dates and location of deployment.
