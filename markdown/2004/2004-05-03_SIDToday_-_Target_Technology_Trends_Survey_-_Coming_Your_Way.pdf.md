Chief, SIGDEV/Target Technology Trends Center (S3C)
(U) SIGINT Development's Target Technology Trends Center (T3C) is looking for target and technology experts to participate in our annual Target Validated Technology Trends survey. We could be looking for you!
(U) The survey notice will be sent out shortly via a Staff Processing Form (SPF) to organization managers and technical leaders at NSA. It will request that SPF recipients compile the list of target and/or technology experts in their organization who will participate in our survey. The lists will be forwarded to the Chief, T3C Analysis Division.
(S//SI) If you are an expert on a target, technology or both, then the T3C wants to hear your expert opinion! Where are our intelligence targets taking technology? What are their communications plans for the future? What technologies will the SIGINT System have to exploit 3-5 years from now?
(U//FOUO) You can make a difference today on how the Signals Intelligence Directorate invests its people, budget and resources tomorrow. But... only if you take our survey first! So... alert your management to include you on the list of experts on their response to the T3C's SPF.
(U//FOUO) Visit T3C's web page, "go t3c", for more information about our products and previous submissions to the budget build process.
