(U//FOUO) The Fort Meade Joint Language Center (JLC) Local language competition is held in March each year. This year's competition was held 22 - 26 March and was a resounding success. Over 70 voice language analysts with expertise in Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Persian-Farsi, Russian, Serbian-Croatian and Spanish participated in the resident games.
(U) Competitors in the language competition met one of the following requirements:

- active duty member of the U.S. Armed Forces
- member of the U.S. Reserve Component
- civilian employee of the Federal Government
(U) Additionally, competitors were filling a linguist billet or a language-required position at the time of competition. At least one member of each team was a graduate of the basic language course in which they competed.
(U) The competition consisted of games including: Listening, Reading, Jeopardy, Intel-triathlon, Impromptu, Spot Report, Power Word, 20 Questions and Showdown. Many units use the Fort Meade Language Competition as an indicator of how some of their linguists might do in the annual Defense Language Institute (DLI) sponsored language competition. The DLI sponsored competition will be held in September.
(U//FOUO) The competition highlighted the caliber of our military members and their critical contributions to the NSA mission. Congratulations to all who participated and a special congratulations to these top finishers:
