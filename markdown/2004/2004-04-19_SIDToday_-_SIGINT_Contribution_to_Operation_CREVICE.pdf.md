(S//SI//REL) You probably saw DIRNSA's message to the work force, thanking you for your work on Operation CREVICE. If that sparked your interest, read on to find out a bit more about the operation...

## (S//SI) Op CREVICE

(TS//SI) Since March 2003, the UK's Security Service and police had been investigating an AQ (al-Qa'ida) support network based in the UK with links to a senior AQ operational planner in Pakistan.
(TS//SI) In February, the UK authorities stepped up their efforts in response to key intelligence revealing that a UK-based member of the network was attempting to mount an attack in the UK using a large improvised explosive device. In addition, the Pakistan-based contact was attempting to obtain nuclear material for use in the device, which was apparently to be deployed in the near future.

## (U) SIGINT Contribution

(TS//SI) It was actually an NSA SIGINT report that sparked the heightened level of interest in the Operation, as the report involved a Pakistan-based and UK-based individual discussing, amongst other things, the composition of a probable explosive.
(TS//SI) During February and March, GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) provided reporting which helped assist Pakistani authorities in locating and detaining the Pakistan-based individual. Call records analysis and reporting expanded Security Service's network knowledge and helped to identify new telephone numbers of key targets in the UK. C2C (computer-to-computer) analysis provided new leads on a Canada-based individual within the network, and other reporting helped to validate the activities of one of the key overseas members of the network.
(TS//SI) Overall, well over 100 SIGINT reports were issued on Operation CREVICE. Although the majority of End Product was GCHQ originated, the NSA reporting contributed significant pieces to the jigsaw.
(TS//SI) Now that arrests have been made, GCHQ is monitoring for any further significant activity, and End Product has been issued on various individuals spreading news of the arrests. In addition, GCHQ is likely to receive more targeting information from Security Service as the investigation continues.
