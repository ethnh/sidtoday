(U//FOUO) A few weeks ago, we reported on a technology called RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, which is used throughout the Internet to syndicate and publish web content, and we discussed its use within NSA, and particularly within NSOC. In the interest of fair and balanced reporting, we want to mention a brand-new competitor to RSS - the Atom Syndication Format.
(U//FOUO) Although RSS is still widely popular on the World Wide Web, it does have its shortcomings, mainly due to the fact that the RSS 2.0 specification is "frozen." Atom intends to address many of the shortcomings of RSS, including development of an Atom API* and sponsorship of the Atom standard by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). However, the most obvious evidence to date of the potential success of Atom is that Google has elected to bypass RSS in favor of Atom as its syndication standard.
(U//FOUO) If you would like more information about RSS, Atom, or content syndication in general, please contact the NSOC web team (DL NSOCWEB) at NSTS.

*(U) API = Application Program Interface
