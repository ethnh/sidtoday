(U//FOUO) Have you heard of the SID Mailbag? It is one avenue the SID workforce has to get answers to questions they may have on any number of subjects. Don't expect advice to lovelorn. But, the topics are at least as interesting. For instance, in the last posting on Dec 15, 2003 the topics covered include:

- The use of Google as the search engine on PINWALE,
- Sharing SIGINT production data with tactical users, and
- Duplication of functions between CSE and the MOC.
(U) Take a look. You might find the answer to something that has been nagging at you and possibly your co-workers for a while. Who knows? What you read may inspire a new question for you to ask that, when answered, will inform others as well as you.
(U) Click here to see the most recent questions and answers. In the future, check the SID Mailbag link under WORKFORCE OUTREACH at the bottom of SIDtoday for new questions and answers.
