FROM: Charles H. Berlin III
SID Chief of Staff
(U//FOUO) In the next month, I am anticipating an Agency call for promotion nominations to the DISES/DISL levels. In preparation for the internal SID review process, I encourage all GG-15 personnel who believe that they have potential to serve in the senior ranks to begin updating their Internal Staffing Resume. It is possible that SID will be working against a short suspense date, so you should begin your updates at this time.
(U//FOUO) Employee promotion profiles will not be available until o/a 1 March, so it is not necessary to prepare or submit a Promotion Review Package until further guidance is received. When the Agency process and timeline are announced, specific information regarding the SID process and timeline will be communicated.
