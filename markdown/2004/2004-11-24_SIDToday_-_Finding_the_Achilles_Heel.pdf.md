(U) Finding the Achilles' Heel

FROM:
NSA Representative to JWAC (S112)
Run Date: 11/24/2004
(U//FOUO) The Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC), located in Dahlgren, Virginia, is an operational warfighting analysis center staffed primarily with scientists and engineers. Approximately 525 civilians and 57 military work at the JWAC. The military are predominantly Navy and Air Force, but all four services are represented. Subordinate to the Joint Forces Command (JFCOM), JWAC directly supports combatant commands, components, and interagency customers. JWAC is not an intelligence center and has no intelligence or Indications \& Warning production requirements... So what does the JWAC do?
(U//FOUO) JWAC provides the combatant commands, Joint Staff, and other customers with effects-based precision targeting options for selected networks and nodes in order to carry out the national security and military strategies of the United States during peace, crisis, and war. JWAC has the ability to conduct comprehensive technical analyses to identify critical networks, nodes, and other points of influence within a threat's infrastructure systems. Recommendations are made for both kinetic and non-kinetic solution sets.
(U//FOUO) JWAC provides "responsive" analytical solutions based on desired effect, objective and end state; and analysis and assessment based on a combination of network expertise and weapon understanding. Developmental areas include: Automated Information Extraction System (AIES), Advanced Collateral Damage Estimation Tool (ACDET), etc.
(U//FOUO) The NSGI Warfighter Imagery Library -- an NGA-sponsored imagery library that provides rapid access to over 7 years of overhead imagery -- is located at JWAC. Remotely accessible via SIPRNET and JWICS, its vital statistics include $24 \times 7$ operations, 14 days-worth of imagery online for fast access, over 2.5 million images online, and 100\% coverage of 35 countries. In a related initiative, JWAC is now hosting two additional libraries for still-frame airborne (U2/Global Hawk) and motion (PREDATOR) imagery. The Community Airborne Library Architecture (CALA) provides a central repository for unexploited digital airborne imagery; it provides web-enabled access for the Defense Department and Intelligence Community across multiple security domains.
(U//FOUO) JWAC is a voracious user of intelligence products and services, including those provided by NSA. However, the relationship is more than just customer and producer. Opportunities for collaboration in the past resulted in timely, enhanced support to the warfighter during the early days of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM. As we continue the Global War on Terrorism, new opportunities are identified and analytic partnerships are formed.
(U//FOUO) The Commander of JWAC is CAPT David Ott, USN. Executive Director is Mr. Bob Tolhurst. Deputy Commander is COL Eric Stanhagen, USA. Deputy Executive Director for Information is
(U//FOUO) There are JWAC detachments at several national agencies: CIA, DIA*, NSA, NGA, and the Joint Staff. The JWAC liaison to NSA is located in the Information Warfare Support Center. POC: LCDR $\square$ nsa.ic.gov; $\square$ (NSTS);
(U//FOUO) In turn, DIA, NGA, NRO*, and NSA maintain liaison offices at JWAC. They work with the JWAC Deputy Executive Director for Information and the JWAC Intelligence Directorate to identify and resolve any issues that impede collaboration.
(U//FOUO) Current NSA POCs include:
