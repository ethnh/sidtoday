(U//FOUO) The below letter was sent in response to the recent article ELINT and TechSIGINT Defined :
(U//FOUO) Submitter name: $\square$
-- (U) Please provide any feedback on the content of the article.
(C) The article concludes with an introduction to TECH SIGINT, and calls out that comms externals excludes anything internal to COMINT signals. The quandary here is that PROFORMA is a branch of COMINT (as explained so eloquently by DIRNSA during his keynote address at the inaugural OP-PROFORMA conference in January of 2003), and deals almost exclusively with the internals of the given communications link/system. The confusion extends when you find PROFORMA being passed by the most common of communications systems. So saying, look inside a common multichannel system and you could find dozens of modems. There's one passing e-mail; that's COMINT. There's another one passing a fax; that's COMINT. Why, here's one passing air surveillance; that's TECH SIGINT! It doesn't quite work. In reality, PROFORMA is more a family of functions associated with sensors, vice a specific set of modulations, frequency ranges, or users.
(U) If one draws a venn chart of COMINT, ELINT and FIS, PROFORMA finds itself in the junction of the three. If it's pushed too far into any single category, confusion ensues.
(U) To address this, a formal PROFORMA Business Plan is being developed as an Enterprise initiative. The result of the business plan should be the institutionalization of PROFORMA.
-- (U) Please provide suggestions for future article content.
(U) JPC has been asked to provide an article for NSA daily, describing PROFORMA, its origins, its uses, and its future. This TECH SIGINT article tickles the subject, but doesn't answer the mail.
(U) I welcome your feedback.
