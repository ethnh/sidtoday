(S//SI) Identifying gaps and recommending solutions to critical resource, access, collection, architecture, and communication issues can be a tall order for SID's Issue Manager Teams. One of the biggest challenges on a long-standing hard target like North Korea is that as numerous initiatives are pursued and dropped over the years, creative minds can become frustrated and stale. Therefore, in an effort to generate a fresh perspective and some "out-of-the-box" thinking and proposals, the Korea Issue Manager Team (KIMT) recently partnered with administrators of the SIGINT Collection Management course (COL603) at the Joint Military Intelligence College (JMIC), Masters of Science of Strategic Intelligence program.
(S//SI) The goal was to involve members of the class (mostly non-SIGINTers) in a mini-ROCK DRILL focused on reconstitution and integration of national and tactical U.S. and South Korean SIGINT collection should war resume on the Korean Peninsula. Members of the class, though limited in SIGINT expertise, were extremely bright and ambitious military and civilian intelligence personnel ready to tackle the challenge.
(S//SI) The idea to partner on a real-world issue such as North Korea originated with the JMIC course administrators and was quickly recognized by the KIMT as a powerful tool to develop new approaches to one of the longest standing SIGINT target challenges in NSA's history. To launch the initiative, the KIMT provided the class with an overview of the United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command go-to-war plans, OPLANs 5026 and 5027, and the two wartime collection scenarios the team wanted them to address. These very same scenarios were simultaneously to be addressed by over 50 SIGINT experts assembled in Seoul, Korea for North Korea ROCK DRILL 5. The class spent the next five weeks researching the problem and developing proposals to optimize SIGINT collection and interoperability under wartime conditions. At the end of this period, they presented their findings to the KIMT.
(U//FOUO) The results of the initiative went far beyond the expectations of the KIMT, or the course administrators for that matter. The class identified at least three new, unique collection initiatives to close anticipated wartime information gaps, which the KIMT will pursue. The remainder of the proposals tracked directly with those generated by the SIGINT experts at ROCK DRILL 5.
(U//FOUO) The KIMT is extremely pleased by the thoughtfulness, hard work and creativity of the JMIC students. The President of the Joint Military Intelligence College, Mr. A. Denis Clift, was similarly impressed with this initiative, comparing it favorably to a Harvard Business School case study model approach to learning. The KIMT looks forward to future partnerships with the JMIC!
