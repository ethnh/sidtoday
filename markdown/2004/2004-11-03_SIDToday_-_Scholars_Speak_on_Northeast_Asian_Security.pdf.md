(U) Scholars Speak on Northeast Asian Security

FROM:
SINIO for East Asia, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 11/03/2004
(U) On 21 September 2004, the SINIO Council hosted leading specialists in their fields for a presentation and discussion on topics that challenge both US and regional security interests. With issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to growing competition for economic markets and energy sources, Northeast Asia challenges US interests both in the tactical "how it is" and in the strategic "how can we shape it."
(U) The NBR* scholars presented findings from their recently published book, "Strategic Asia 2004-2005: Confronting Terrorism in the Pursuit of Power," the fourth volume in the Strategic Asia series. The authors focused on the Global War on Terrorism and resulting policy challenges for the United States in Asia; security challenges in Northeast Asia and consequences for US relations; the North and South Korean nuclear programs; and energy insecurity in Northeast Asia.
(U//FOUO) This Seminar was the latest offering in the SINIO Council Speaker Series, in which leaders in the intelligence, policy, and academic communities present cutting-edge thinking on today's and tomorrow's most challenging issues.
