# (U) A\&P Leadership Changes 

FROM: Jim Allen
SID Deputy Director for Analysis and Production (S2)
Run Date: 01/06/2004

FROM: Jim Allen
SID Deputy Director for Analysis and Production (S2)
(U//FOUO) Recently the Director approved three changes in A\&P senior leadership:

- as Associate Deputy Director for Production,
- as Chief of Operations, and
- Dan Ennis as Chief of the Office of Russia.
(U//FOUO) S3 formerly Chief of the Office of Russia, replaces $\square$ S4 was an outstanding Production Manager and has a lot of experience leading a globally distributed analytic community. Last summer he filled in as Assistant DDAP during the transition in leadership, so he is ready to jump right in.
(U//FOUO) I had earlier announced as Acting Chief of Operations. He got off to a great start, and I am happy to have him confirmed.
(U//FOUO) Dan was $\square$ Deputy - he is the latest in a long line of superior leaders in that (and predecessor) organization(s).
(U//FOUO) I thank for his leadership from the formation of A\&P through the numerous challenges of the tumultuous years that followed. He always provided wise counsel and worked hard to ensure that we could meet changing customer requirements. I will miss him and wish him well as Deputy Director of NSOC.
(U//FOUO) Please join me in welcoming $\square$ and Dan to their new positions. I expect to announce additional fills and/or intentions with respect to other senior positions soon.
