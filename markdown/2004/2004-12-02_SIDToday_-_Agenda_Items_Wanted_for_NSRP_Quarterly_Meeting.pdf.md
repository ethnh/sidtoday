(U//FOUO) Agenda Items Wanted for NSRP Quarterly Meeting
FROM:
Information Needs (S111)
Run Date: 12/02/2004
(U//FOUO) In January 2004 the Customer Service Manager (CSM) team in S111 solicited feedback from a number of elements within Analysis \& Production (S2) on the potential utility of a regularly scheduled meeting to address issues related to our roles in the National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP).
(U//FOUO) The response from A\&P was positive. They, too, saw a need for such a forum. So began the NSRP Quarterly Synchronization Meeting.
(U//FOUO) To date we've had four meetings which took place in February, April, July, and October. A myriad of topics have been covered with subjects ranging from Information Need assignment rules and successful IN management practices in particular workcenters, to dissemination issues, feedback on the recent SIGINT User's Conference, and discussions on NSRP tool and process changes, such as the new Level of Effort format. The participants have included representatives from a number of organizations within S1, S2, and S3. The gathering has also provided an opportunity to meet NSRP compatriots and put a face with a name.
(U//FOUO) The next meeting will be held in January. We're soliciting desired agenda items. Please email us with any topics you would like addressed.
(U//FOUO) Attendance is open to all interested parties. If you're not already on our distro for the notification and update emails please advise and we'll add you. We can be reached via email alias "DL NSRPTEAM" or by calling www.sdmex. secure.
