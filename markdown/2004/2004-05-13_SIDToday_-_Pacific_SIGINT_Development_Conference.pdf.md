(U//FOUO) A Pacific SIGINT Development Conference sponsored by Sigint Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) and hosted by Kunia Regional Security Operations Center (KRSOC) took place from 26 to 28 April 2004 in Hawaii.
(C) With a total of 53 delegates there was a healthy mix of Pacific-theater representatives from KRSOC, NSA/CSS Pacific, Misawa Security Operations Center (MSOC), Alaska Mission Operation Center, Yakima Research Station and Field Station Korea and a strong NSAW contingent from Radio Frequency Operations, Office of Target Pursuit and four Analysis \& Production Product Lines, as well as Second Party representatives from DSD, GCSB and GCHQ*.
(S//SI)) The Conference provided the opportunity for in-theater presenters to talk about their SIGDEV successes and the difficulties they face. In return, delegates received briefings on some of the National and 5-Eyes initiatives, as well as the work of SIGDEV teams in the China and Korea, Counterterrorism, Russia, and International Crime and Narcotics Product Lines.
(U//FOUO) Two days of briefings and lively discussions intended to facilitate the exchange of information, were followed by a full morning session that identified a number of actions that will enable better orchestration and coordination of SIGDEV activities, some of which will have benefits beyond the confines of the Pacific-theater.
(U//FOUO) SSG would like to thank all the briefers, organizers and those delegates who were prepared to travel great distances at short notice in helping make this conference such a success. We now look forward to the next conference, possibly hosted by MSOC in September 2004, taking SIGDEV in the Pacific-theater to even greater heights.
