FROM: Lynda B. Streight
(U//FOUO) Upon my retirement, I would like to say farewell to everyone in SID and I would like to introduce the new SID Workforce Performance Management Executive, First, to everyone in SID, a thank you for your support, for your suggestions, for being you. You are the heart and soul of this Agency; the work you do keeps America and the world free. Always be proud of it.
(U//FOUO) I believe we have come a long way and accomplished a lot for the people of SID since SID was formed in February 2001. In the Performance Management area we have:

- instituted important P3 guidelines and instilled the importance of P3s in the entire compensation process. There are now mandatory P3 criteria for seniors and managers; Senior P3s are posted to the web so everyone can cascade down from them; and we have guidance to keep P3 scores honest and reasonable and not inflated.
- developed a promotion process that puts decisions in the hands of the managers closest to the individuals; we now have management-driven decisions at the lowest level possible without fairsharing. The process is posted for all to see.
- fought for SID's share of the dollars. We work constantly with HRS on the allocations to make sure that SID does not slide backwards with its allocations.
- allocated the promotion money by Agency and SID areas of emphasis, rather than fair-shared by a complicated formula of time-in-grade and numbers of people in-grade, etc. SID believes that promotions should go to those most deserving; if the money is fairshared this cannot happen.
- received more money than in past years because we developed a logical argument that we took to the Director and in turn received additional promotion and awards dollars for the last cycle.
- emphasized feedback, not just at P3 and promotion time, but throughout the year. We have worked with, and will continue to work with, ADET and HRS to develop management leadership training which will include feedback training.
- put all information on the web for all to see. We developed many guides for the processes, for feedback, for timelines, and many other areas of importance to SID.
- communicated with the work force through the web, SID-alls, and answering individual questions and emails. Communication is the key and we will continue to emphasize that.
(U//FOUO) will continue working all the these efforts and will continue to fight for the SID people. Before taking this job he was the Agency hiring manager, so he is very familiar with many aspects of SID. He has a great background for this work and will have many great ideas for doing things even better for all of you. Please welcome him and encourage him with support and ideas.
