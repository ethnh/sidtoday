(U//FOUO) Ever hear of the Electromagnetic-Space (E-Space) program office? Many haven't. Yet it is an important, ongoing initiative nestled in the Customer Relationships Directorate (S1) whose purpose is to stand up an E-Space Analysis Center in support of electronic warfare (EW) operators, planners, and developers. The program office took shape in August 2002, following guidance from what is now the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD (I)). It gained newfound prominence with the 30 October 2003 publication of SECDEF's Information Operations Roadmap, which states that the E-Space Analysis Center should be DoD's focal point for intelligence support to EW .
(U//FOUO) One of its primary goals is to provide integrated, full-spectrum views of an adversary's electromagnetic space to enable the development of capabilities and operational courses of action to support Information Operations (IO). A key aspect of this effort is to afford ready access to integrated EW database information via JWICS and SIPRNET portals.
(U//FOUO) Steady progress has been made over the past year and a half, with prototype development well underway and the selection of a prime development contractor, Booz-AllenHamilton, in September 2003. To stay connected with the end customer, the program office recently concluded two days of meetings with EW community subject-matter experts. The standing E-Space Integrated Product Team (IPT) met the first day to elicit user feedback on the development system (Spiral 1A). Day two consisted of a hands-on demonstration and system familiarization for designated beta test site representatives. Not all locations were able to participate, but actual beta testing will entail sending a contractor support team to the sites listed below in the March/April 2004 timeframe:

- USSTRATCOM
- USSOCOM
- USPACOM
- NASIC (National Air and Space Intelligence Center)
- JWAC (Joint Warfare Analysis Center)
- NAWC (Naval Air Warfare Center)
- Air Force's 53rd EW Wing
- Air Force's 453rd EW Squadron
(U//FOUO) The operational capability for Spiral 1B (certified and accredited) is set for late September 2004, at which point all potential users will be able to access the E-Space portals. This initial effort will allow single-sign-on access to roughly a dozen NSA and non-NSA EWrelated databases and an ability to query across multiple databases. Rollout of Spiral 2 is anticipated in June 2005. Among other enhancements, Spiral 2 will include access to additional databases, expanded query capabilities, data visualization tools, and integrated access to opensource reference data. In the meantime, the program office will continue to interact and dialogue with EW users and producers to optimize in-formation exchange and ensure development of a system that meets the intended purpose.
