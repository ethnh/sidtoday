# (U//FOUO) More on SCOR 

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA Signals Intelligence Director Run Date: 11/29/2004
(U//FOUO) Last week, I told you about our need to create the environment to foster and enable a net-centric SIGINT System for the United States that is based on Common Operating Picture (COP) and a collaborative, global decision-making process. In that article, I focused on the investments to infrastructure that are needed to facilitate that change. Building such an environment will require more than infrastructure - it will also need a new model of governance.
(U//FOUO) Prior to the SCOR Conference, the SID Leadership had identified the DIRNSA's 17 major responsibilities for the SIGINT leadership. In addition, we had determined that SID is primarily responsible to the DIRNSA for the first 4 responsibilities (we have an important role in the execution of the other 13, but many of these are led by NSA corporate-level partners). We had already developed and implemented processes for the first 3 responsibilities, which can be grouped under the major governing task called "Produce SIGINT for the Nation". These three responsibilities drive Responsibility \#4, which we have labeled "Direct and Operate the US SIGINT System." Responsibility \#4, in turn, drives or influences all of the other 13 Responsibilities. The goal of the SCOR Conference was to have a workshop with the leaders from across the U.S. SIGINT System that would begin developing and documenting processes for Responsibility \#4.
(U//FOUO) The discussions over the three days were open, frank, enlightening and encouraging. We are far enough along in our thinking to publish the SID Management Directive Number 411 dealing with responsibilities at the strategic level for governance of the U.S. SIGINT System. In addition, within the next several weeks, I will draft a more detailed plan for strategic governance of Responsibility \#4. These documents are critical, because they will drive the development of similar processes and governance mechanisms in all elements of the U.S SIGINT System.
(U//FOUO) Meanwhile, we will continue to put into place levers that will allow us to execute our governance responsibilities and to develop a systematic, structured way of dealing with all of the areas for which SID is responsible. We will also continue to encourage the rest of the corporation to partner with us, so that we can fulfill the DIRNSA's vision, becoming a single, global, selfaware, self-synchronzing SIGINT System the rest of the corporation to partner with us to synchronize and align their processes and governance mechanisms for their governance responsibilities.
(U//FOUO) As you can see, there is much work to be done. All of the implementing processes for CRD, A\&P, and DA will have to be developed, eventually trickling down into local processes. However, we've made a lot of progress already, and we know what we must do to get to our desired destination. We are determined to create a seamless, global system that produces the best SIGINT possible, in the most efficient way. Step by step, we'll make this a reality!
