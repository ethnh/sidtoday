(S) Colombian President Gives Credit to SIGINT Tip for Saving His Life FROM: International Crime and Narcotics (S2F)
Run Date: 10/05/2004
(S//SI) On 20 August 2004, MRSOC J321 issued a report highlighting the interest of a FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) narcoterrorist in the visit of Colombian President Uribe to Cartagena del Chaira. The FARC member not only hoped to be in Cartagena del Chaira on the date of the Colombian President's visit, but was to receive a detailed itinerary for the visit from an employee in the mayor's office.
(S//SI) Upon receiving this information, CIA Station Bogota requested NSA approval of text for foreign release, to be passed to the appropriate liaison services for action. The request was granted within hours.
(S//SI) The Colombian Presidential Palace intelligence service was advised immediately, and the President's trip was cancelled based on this tip. President Uribe himself thanked senior Station personnel for providing this information and for "saving his life."
(S//SI) This success was the result of collaboration among MRSOC, the International Crime and Narcotics Product Line, and NSA personnel in Bogota.
