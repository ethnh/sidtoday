(TS//SI//REL) The CIA recently passed on kudos to SIGINTers for playing a key role in the May 30th capture of an al-Qa'ida operative. The terrorist, named Umar Baziyani, had served as a close aide to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, helping to direct a series of attacks on U.S. and allied forces in Iraq. Several SIGINT elements helped geolocate Baziyani who, like other al-Qa'ida members, was using Internet cafes in Baghdad to communicate. SIGINTers effectively combined information gathered across accesses and environments to support this capture. New uses of SIGINT data, including metadata, also played an essential role.
(TS//SI//REL) The following SIGINT organizations, in particular, made great contributions to this operation:

- Network Analysis Center (NAC - S31SD)
- Counterterrorism Product Line (S2I)
- Commercial Technologies (S3A)
- Tailored Access Operations (S32)
- Link Access Programs (S33)
- KEYSCORE (R1, MHS)
- CSG Baghdad
(TS//SI//REL) The CIA would like to pursue all opportunities to incorporate SIGINT -- in near real-time -- into tactical HUMINT operations. The SIGINT information can be passed to teams on the ground who are responsible for surveilling and capturing terrorists who use the internet, thereby painting "as timely and accurate a picture of the virtual battleground" as possible.
