(U//FOUO) SHAREDVISION Program is Up and Running
FROM:
Chief, Link Access Programs (S33)
Run Date: 09/27/2004
(S//SI) There's a very exciting FORNSAT initiative underway: SHAREDVISION, a partner program to modernize the FORNSAT sites . With endorsement from the SIGINT Directors of each of the 5-Eyes Partners (NSA, GCHQ, DSD, GCSB, and CSE) and signing of the SHAREDVISION Memorandum of Agreement in late June 2004, the FORNSAT Division, within Link Access, formally launched the SHAREDVISION program. The ultimate goal of the program, block change of the field site architecture, will be achieved by developing and deploying a common, flexible, scalable, and responsive architecture to all the FORNSAT sites.
(S//SI) The most significant aspect of this ambitious program is the division of effort and use of partnerships. As a model of 5-Eyes cooperation, GCHQ, DSD, GCSB, and CSE are teaming with NSA to create the SHAREDVISION system. Each partner is developing and providing components or engineering talent to the effort, which is being managed by the SHAREDVISION Program Management Office within the FORNSAT Division. Under this agreement, each partner is reliant on the others to develop and support whole components of the overall SHAREDVISION system. NSA will lead the integration of the system, but for perhaps the first time, a truly 5-Eyes system development effort is underway.
