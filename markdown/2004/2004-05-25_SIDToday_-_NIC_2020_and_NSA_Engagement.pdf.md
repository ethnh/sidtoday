(U//FOUO) The National Intelligence Council's (NIC) 2020 project is currently engaging experts worldwide in designing plausible scenarios for the year 2020. The 2020 effort is a follow-on study to the NIC's Global Trends 2015 project that identified 7 key drivers. These drivers are: Demographics, Natural Resources and the Environment, Science and Technology, Global Economy and Globalization, National and International Governance, Future Conflict, and the Role of the US. A new driver has been added for the 2020 study-- Social Identity.
(U//FOUO) The SINIO Council, in cooperation with the Strategic Planning Office and Toffler Associates, is currently engaging the NSA Community in support of the NIC 2020 project in the following ways:

# (U) IAI ESSAY CONTEST 

(U//FOUO) THE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS INSTITUTE has announced its annual essay contest. This year's contest is unique in that the IAI has chosen a subject that is relevant to the National Intelligence Council's (NIC) 2020 project.
(U//FOUO) The IAI invites you to draft an UNCLASSIFIED essay that depicts a plausible global scenario out to the year 2020. In addition to monetary prizes, IAI essay entries may be used in NIC discussions and publications as well as in internal NSA discussions on strategic planning and input to the NIC project. The NIC 2020 publication will be aimed at policymakers, but will also be read and used widely in the global intelligence and academic communities.
(U) Please go to the IAI website for additional details and contest rules.

## (U) NSA OUTREACH SESSIONS

(U) As a vital component of NSA's participation in the NIC2020 project, the SINIO Council -- in partnership with SIGINT Planning and Toffler Associates -- is building its own scenarios for presentation to the NIC. You too are invited to participate! How? By joining one of our NIC2020 Outreach Sessions. We are seeking to bring in viewpoints from across the Agency, and the information garnered will be used to both test and strengthen the SINIOs' scenario-building exercise. All we ask for is two hours of your time for a session with a Toffler Associates facilitator. You and the other members of your group will be asked a series of questions that will get you thinking about the future in new and different ways. The sessions are designed to be an enjoyable learning experience, and the proceedings even include free food and a door prize!
(U) The outreach sessions will be held throughout May and June. If you would like to participate, please contact Brenda Martineau ( $\square$ ) or $\square$ ( $\square$ ) and they will get you in contact with the appropriate Outreach Session leader. We look forward to hearing from you!

## (U) TECHNOLOGY 2020 EVENT and TECH PANEL ENGAGEMENT

(U//FOUO) On 2 and 3 June SID is sponsoring a Technology 2020 event that aims to bring together big thinkers across government, industry, and academia to discuss plausible and key scenarios for science and technology in the year 2020. The future shape of science and technology affects the nature of our targets from a communications exploitation perspective as well as from a future national security threat perspective. The agenda will focus the discussion in various technology areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Military Technology, Information Assurance, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Biotechnology, Communications, and
areas of technology convergences. The thought leaders will also be asked to consider and discuss boarder implications of technology on the world in 2020. Results from the session will contribute to the development of a technology report in support of the National Intelligence Council and will drive strategic planning for national-level decision-makers.
(U//FOUO) Following up what is developed in this unclassified event, SID will then engage NSA's Technology Panel, an advisory panel consisting of leaders in the private sector, in a classified discussion of potential futures.
