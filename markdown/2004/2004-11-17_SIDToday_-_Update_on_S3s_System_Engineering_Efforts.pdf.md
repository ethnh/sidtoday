(S//SI) Update on S3's System Engineering Efforts
FROM:
Technical Director, SID Systems Engineering Office (S01A)
Run Date: 11/17/2004
(S//SI) I'd like to update you on Data Acquisition's (S3) efforts to strengthen the management of our Digital Network Intelligence (DNI) activities. As mentioned in an August SID today article , S3 asked me to advise them on systems engineering issues that arise as we endeavor to add functionality and connectedness to an already complex system. My role in this regard is to ensure the improvements we make are done in such a way that they will "fit into NSA's transformational programs."
(S//SI) Many key initiatives are coming together, calling for us to use good system engineering and program management practices to produce well-defined system interfaces. These include activities associated with:

- Access and Collection,
- Processing and Exploitation,
- Filtering and Selection,
- Selector Management,
- Data Storage,
- Automated Data Manipulation and
- Presentation services.
(S//SI) First, we met with representatives throughout SID to better understand the challenges associated with the exploitation of DNI and to discover ways to respond effectively to those challenges. As mentioned in the August note, TRAFFICTHIEF, Global Newtwork Development Activity (GNDA), CES's WEALTHYCLUSTER program, Persona Session Collection, Strong Selector Management, Unified Targeting Tool and Metadata Strategy are good examples of the ongoing activities meant to improve our ability to exploit DNI on a global scale.
(S//SI) Additionally, we just had our first review with S3 leadership where we've started to identify key issues and gaps. Next steps include the identification of the programmatic boundaries and dependencies between these key initiatives, which will be discussed in a future update.
