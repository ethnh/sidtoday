(U//FOUO) Generally Speaking: Supporting the Tactical Units
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director
Run Date: 09/02/2004
(S//REL) Over the last few months, we have made significant progress in improving our SIGINT support to tactical elements in Iraq and Afghanistan. "Tactical elements" refers to the division, brigade and battalion level -- this is where information is turned into military operations. Although in the past we've done well in supporting commanders at higher military echelons, it became clear to us this spring that SIGINT was largely absent where the "rubber meets the road" and we needed to do more. Our objective was not only to get more usable intelligence to that level, but also to tie forwarddeployed forces into the global SIGINT system. We still have a long way to go in this effort, but here is an update on what we have accomplished:
(S//REL) As explained in the Director's WARgram-62 ("NSA/CSS Transforming National-Tactical Integration in Iraq") of 2 June, NSA launched a three-part initiative to make this happen. Where do we stand now?

- (U) First Initiative: Effect improvements to SECRET reporting to division level and below
(C//REL) The standard information system used at these echelons is SIPRNet, which contains information at the straight-SECRET level, including sanitized SIGINT reports. SID has undertaken training to help SIGINT reporters get the most actionable information possible into their tear-lines. In addition, although these reports can be "pulled" from SIPRNet, we have now added a "push" method of dissemination by emailing our tear-line reports directly to division-and-below intelligence personnel. This is only a first step -- we must continue to find ways to improve the tearline dissemination process and to make it a routine part of our business. More importantly, we must continue to refine and improve the quality and utility of our tearline reporting, to ensure that critical information gets to the folks who need it.
- (U//FOUO) Second Initiative: Establish TSSI/NSANet connectivity to brigade level and upgrade tactical collection systems
(S//REL) NSA has purchased equipment that allows soldiers in the field 2-way access to NSANet, and we are deploying it to every division in Iraq and to some in Afghanistan. Tactical forces can now communicate directly with experts located throughout the SIGINT Enterprise to share information -- just the synergy we wanted to achieve. The equipment also includes collection systems that can be tuned locally or from Fort Meade! There are now 14 suites -- manned by analysts and linguists -- currently operating in Iraq. The Tactical Platforms Division (S3314) within Radio Frequency Operations, ACO (Army Cryptologic Operations) and NTIO (the National Tactical Integration Office - S14) have done a great job making this happen. Again, we have a long way to go, but we are off to a good start.
- (U//FOUO) Third Initiative: Deploy "national presence" at divisions to provide valueadded SIGINT analysis and national reach-back
(S//REL) An Army division is composed of roughly 20,000 troops. In the past, each division would include a staff of 50 or so SIGINT analysts; now, however, this number has been reduced to just 6 or 7. NSA has deployed Cryptologic Support Teams (CSTs) to augment these small division staffs, working side-by-side with them to improve their capabilities. Each CST consists of 4-5 military and civilian SIGINT analysts who disseminate SIGINT, explain what it means, and provide linkage back to NSA and the rest of the SIGINT Enterprise. Some CSTs are up and running, and the remainder will be in place by 10 September. I am already receiving praise from commanders who recognize the impact these CSTs are having. We will provide this support for a two-year period, after which the military division staffs will be ready to take over the mission.
(S//REL) Hopefully, these are just the beginnings of a great success story. We identified a problem, made quick decisions, provided sufficient funding (the Director authorized $\$ 30$ million for this effort), and moved out! We must continue the momentum and follow through to provide the support that tactical units need.
(S//REL) I congratulate everyone here at Fort Meade contributing to this effort, and a special thanks to those who volunteered to deploy to Iraq with the CSTs. They'll tell their grandchildren about it someday.
