(U//FOUO) The Coast Guard's 'Top 10' Intel Requirements
FROM:
USCG Account Manager (S112)
Run Date: $12 / 21 / 2004$

What are the hot issues for the USCG this coming year? (U)
(U) Are you feeling a bit "busy" because of everything you have to do before the holidays? Pulled in several different directions? That's how I imagine the US Coast Guard (USCG) may see itself these days.
(U//FOUO) USCG's varied missions* lead to a plethora of intelligence requirements. Thanks to the Customer SCORECARD., an S11 initiative designed to measure our customers' needs and satisfaction with SID support, we have the top ten prioritized requirements straight from Mr. James Sloan, the Assistant Commandant for Intelligence at Coast Guard HQ in Washington, D.C. The SEAM (Senior Executive Account Manager) for Coast Guard conducted a SCORECARD discussion with Mr. Sloan in October, and part of the discussion involved USCG's ten most important mission requirements for the upcoming 6-12 months.
(S//SI) And now, in the time-honored style of David Letterman, here are the USCG's top ten:

- Number 10 - Piracy on the high seas
- Number 9 - International Fisheries
- Number 8 - Alien Smuggling
- Number 7 - International Crime and Narcotics
- Number 6 - Indications and Warning of Mass Migration
- Number 5 - Counter Proliferation and Weapons of Mass Destruction
- Number 4 - Ports, Waterways and Coastal Security
- Number 3 - ELINT - White Ship Tracking**
- Number 2 - Search and Rescue
- And Number 1, as with many other organizations, is Counterterrorism
(S//SI) These requirements are supported by many SID elements, including International Crime and Narcotics (S2F); Proliferation and Arms Control (S2G); Maritime Analysis Support Team (S2JF3); Counterterrorism (S2I); Regional Targets (S2A); and the SANDKEY program . Moreover, we have CSG support in Alameda, CA, at USCG's MIFC PAC (Maritime Intelligence Fusion Center - Pacific) and in Key West, through JIATF-SOUTH (Joint Interagency Task Force South).
(U) In addition, Mr. Sloan gave SID very high marks regarding his organization's satisfaction with the NSA-USCG relationship. For more information about NSA - USCG interaction, you may contact:

(U) Notes:
*(U) Established in August 1790 by the First Congress of the United States, as a kind of "floating police service" to collect duties on vessels and imported goods, the Coast Guard is the nation's oldest continuous maritime service. It was variously known as, "the system of cutters," the "Revenue Marine," the "Revenue-Marine Service," the "Revenue Service" and the "RevenueCutter Service." In 1915, the Revenue-Cutter Service and another organization, the Lifesaving Service, were combined to form the U.S. Coast Guard.
(U) The USCG is responsible for the safety of the nation's waterways, the enforcement of laws relating to navigation, the protection of our maritime resources and the rescue of those in danger at sea. It became a member of the intelligence community in 2001, part of the cryptologic community in 2002 and, finally, was transferred from the Department of Transportation to become an element of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003.
**(U) White ship tracking = "All non-military, non-public merchant shipping"
