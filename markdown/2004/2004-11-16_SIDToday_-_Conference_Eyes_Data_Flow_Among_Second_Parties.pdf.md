(U) Conference Eyes Data Flow Among Second Parties

(S//SI) How can we ensure that data flows (i.e. data exchange of text, DNI*, voice and fax) between Second Parties are operating at maximum efficiency? This was the question addressed at the Data Flow Management Working Group (DFMWG) Conference held at NSAW from October 4-7. The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) Data Flow and Collection Forwarding division served as host of the annual event, with representatives from all Five-Eyes SIGINT agencies (NSA, GCHQ, CSE, DSD, and GCSB*) in attendance. Opportunities such as this conference provide a forum to resolve any current problems with data exchange and ensure that plans for the future are agreed upon and coordinated.
(S//SI) A common theme of standardization and simplification dominated much of the conference discussion. Central to this standardization theme was the development of Terms of Reference (TORs) for the DFMWG, which provides a common lexicon for all partners and reflects strategic as well as tactical directions. An update on the Common Cryptologic Data Format (CCDF) delineated the changes and upgrades on the new XML format, designed to ultimately provide a standard end-to-end format for data transfers.
(C//SI) Participants discussed a proposal for zipcode series expansion to accommodate the increase of distribution to more locations since 9/11. (Zipcode is a sequence of alphanumeric characters that are used as an address for the routing of voice and fax data files.) All partners agreed to the necessity of undertaking this multi-level task. Among the other topics addressed were:

- Global Network Forum (GNF) brief
- One Number Maximum Reach
- Mission Assurance Update
- Global Prioritization Update
- Shared Vision Briefing
- SIGINT Modernization Effort at GCHQ
(U//FOUO) In addition to the Annual Conference, which will be held at CSE in 2005, the group agreed to conduct a six-month review of progress on the actions formulated at this meeting using Info WorkSpace (IWS). This added session is indicative of the growing role and commitment of our Second Party partners to the interoperability of Five-Eyes data sharing and the future of data flow management.
