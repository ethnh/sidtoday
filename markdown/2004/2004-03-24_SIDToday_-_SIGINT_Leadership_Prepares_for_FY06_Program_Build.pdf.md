(U) Each year around this time the SIGINT Leadership and the organizations directly involved in the preparation of it begin the long, hard road to the next Program Build. Most of us are not really affected by this process even though we are all affected by the outcome. The FY05 program build recently reached the stage of delivering the CBJB to Congress.
(U) In preparation for the FY06 Program Build activities, the SIGINT Leadership commissioned a study to help them make the best decisions.
(U) The study, delivered at the 24 Feb 04 SIGINT leadership offsite, is intended to provide relevant background information needed for the leadership to provide guidance for the program builders.
(U//FOUO) The driving element of the study is that the SIGINT Enterprise needs to understand the forces shaping the SIGINT environment from outside the organization, including views from customers, guidance, technology developments, and the geopolitical outlook for the near future. In order to provide this, S01X, with Toffler Associates, took relevant data from internal NSA and Intelligence Community sources such as the recent Target Technology Trends Center report, the SINIO Geopolitical Forecast, and DOD/IC and Agency guidance. Additional outside information came from reviewing "real world" cases of knowledge-based organizations facing challenges similar to those faced by the SIGINT Enterprise. These cases were from commercial, civil government and military sectors.
(U//FOUO) The presentation shows that the SIGINT Enterprise -- like other knowledge organizations -- is in a constant cycle of adaptation driven by customer demands and changes in the external operating environment. Organizations in this cycle must make big bets on the future or risk becoming a fixed strategic target. For us this means a greater and greater emphasis on adapting to new operating requirements and greater sharing of information with partners and customers.
(U) After reading this presentation, what do you think should be stressed in NSA's efforts in FY06?
