# (U) SID Deployment Coins Awarded

Run Date: 08/02/2004
(U//FOUO) On Tuesday, July 27, at a ceremony in the Friedman Auditorium, MG Quirk thanked SIGINTers who returned from deployment to hostile areas between 1 Jan 04 and 31 May 04.
(U) We asked a few of those who received this recognition to tell us where they went, what they did and to give us their impression of the event. Here is what they had to say:
(U) "I was very impressed with the fact that MG Quirk took the time to speak at the ceremony personally. That shows how much SID has valued and supported these deployments."
(U) "I was particularly glad that the ceremony combined agency civilian and military employees who had deployed together with the same mission and goals. The ceremony was a great opportunity to see fellow OIF/OEF "alumni" and celebrate the fact that we have all returned safely. It's obvious that a lot of time and care were taken to prepare unique certificates and coins rather than the standard SID coins. This certificate will hang on my office wall for the next fifty years until I retire, when I will still be telling stories about the best experience of my career."
(U) "I was a civilian Intelligence Analyst deployed to CSG Baghdad from October 2003 through February 2004."
(U//FOUO) "I thought the ceremony was nice, short and very personal. Starting out with the national anthem was very moving as we all strive to keep our nation safe. MG Quirk's opening remarks made me proud of what I do and of my most recent deployment. When my turn to walk across the stage came, I felt a bit nervous since this was the first time I had met MG Quirk. When I shook his hand, received the certificate and coin, and heard him thanking me for my sacrifice, I felt so proud. The certificate is a real nice one and yes I have already put it on my desk. Also, and and were recognized for their support in the travel office ... that was well deserved!
(U) "My most recent deployment was from March-May 2004 into Iraq as a signals expert, conducting surveys."
(U//FOUO) "With folks being deployed from all parts of the Enterprise it was really great to see many who were in Iraq at the same time I was. SID really went the distance to make it a quality ceremony. The slide show presented prior to the formal ceremony was a collection of shots of the places and surroundings where folks had been deployed. That combined with seeing people I was deployed with really brought back the experience. The certificate is a keeper because it's not one of those black-lettered-on-white-background-check-the-block-certificates. Someone spent some time putting a nice statement of thanks and recognition from MG Quirk over a photo of gun waving, RPG toting radicals. It's up on my office wall already. What really made it outstanding was when MG Quirk recognized and in SID Travel. They certainly deserve recognition for the quality support they provided to us while we were deployed."
(U) "I was the Chief of the CSG in Baghdad from January into May."
(U) "I thought it was a nice ceremony and a great opportunity for folks who had a tough job in a difficult environment to get recognized. I was thoroughly impressed with all the NSAers I worked with in Iraq and was glad to see them receive a coin from MG Quirk. It was like a mini Iraq reunion in the Friedman yesterday."
(TS//SI) "I spent 2-1/2 months in Baghdad (that was my 3rd trip to Iraq in the last year) as OIC of the Office of Target \& Reconnaissance (OTRS) Forward Operating Base (FOB). We had a seven member team stationed out of the VVIP terminal at Baghdad International Airport and were heavily involved with exploiting the emerging Iraqna GSM network, Wireless LAN, GOSSAMER Operations and Syrian GSM bleed-over surveys."
(U) As noted in the announcement of the ceremony on SIDtoday, additional ceremonies will be held quarterly.
