(U/FOUO) MG Quirk and Charlie Meals will be appearing on TalkNSA on August 10, 2004. TalkNSA is unique because it is a live broadcast where the "guests" answer questions generated by either an email or phone call. Anyone can ask a question.
(U) We know not everyone will be at work while TalkNSA is on. So, if you are a shiftworker, will be on leave or are in a timezone that isn't the same as NSAW's, you can still get a question to the Signals Intelligence Director during the show.
(U) How? By sending your questions using the "Comments and Suggestions" function of this article. Who knows? Your question just might be the one that has been on everyone's mind but no one will ask. As always, there is also the option to ask questions during the broadcast itself, either by sending an email to DL TALKNSA (or 000000000000000 Call-ins receive first priority.
(U) Questions received as a result of this article that are not answered during the show will be answered on SIDtoday or in the in the SID Mailbag.
