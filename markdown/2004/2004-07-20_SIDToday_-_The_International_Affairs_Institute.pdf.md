## FROM: <br> International Affairs Institute

(U//FOUO) The International Affairs Institute has been reaching out to the workforce for over 30 years, presenting to the NSA workforce a variety of distinguished speakers from government, industry, and academia. The IAI is a member of NSA's Council of Learned Organizations and its aim is to promote an interest in international events and affairs while providing unique insights into those issues. The IAI pursues its mission through the following activities:

The International Challenge : Open to all NSA employees, the annual International Challenge is an unclassifed written contest which consists of 100 multiple-choice questions on the following topics: international and domestic affairs, politics, economics, history, current events, the military, and geography. Cash prizes are awarded to the participants achieving the first-, second-, and third-highest scores. The next Challenge will be this fall.

Essay Contest : The IAI's annual essay contest covers a range of subjects, and this year's contest on Global Scenarios for the Year 2020 has the potential to inform the National Intelligence Council's 2020 project. Cash prizes will also be awarded!

Speaker Series : One of the IAI's highest priorities is to arrange for speakers to address the NSA workforce on matters of current international interest. Recent speakers have included:

- Ambassador Wendy Sherman, Former Special Advisor to President Clinton and Policy Coordinator on North Korea, who spoke on "North Korea, Iran, and Beyond: Where in the World Are We?"
- Bruce Berkowitz, Senior Analyst, Rand Corporation, who discussed his book "The New Face of War: How War Will be Fought in the 21st Century."
- Mark Lowenthal, A/DCI for Analysis \& Production, who spoke on "The Global War on Terrorism: Implications for the Intelligence Community."
- Ambassador Nat Howell, who spoke on "Iraq, Middle East and Al Q'aida."

Book Sales : IAI hosts book sales that offer members the opportunity to sell their books related to international relations and pick up some new titles. Our next used book consignment sale is being planned for early December.
(U//FOUO) The organization is also extremely well connected to the IA (Intelligence Analysis) Intern program. An intern sits on the IAI Board, and the organization has recently instituted a new policy
