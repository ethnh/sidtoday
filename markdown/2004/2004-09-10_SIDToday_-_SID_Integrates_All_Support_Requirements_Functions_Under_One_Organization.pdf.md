(U//FOUO) Would you believe that it has been four months since the SID People Office and the SIGINT Support Requirements Division merged? (See "Changes in the SID Staff.".) Well, it's true. The Workforce Planning and Investment and Reserve Mission Management missions are now consolidated in the new SIGINT Workforce and Support Requirements (S01R3) organization.
(U//FOUO) SIGINT Workforce and Support Requirements (S01R3) acts as the Executive Agent for SID's mission support requirements. (For more information, see the S01R3 Missions and Functions.) We facilitate the collection of requirements by collaborating with SID Chiefs of Staff.
(U//FOUO) To break it down, here's a list of our functional areas, with points of contact:

- Support Requirement Strategies (POC: $\square$
- Workforce planning requirements (POC: $\square$
- Hiring and personnel acquisition requirements (POC: $\square$
- Long-term TDY Deployment requirements (POC: $\square$
- Skill development requirements (POC: $\square$
