(C) At the 30 April morning meeting, , Deputy Directory for Data Acquisition, reported a "successful collaboration between SID and IAD in the use of SIGINT technology by IAD/Joint COMSEC Monitoring Activity (JCMA). A great example of Transformation 2.0, Petal One collaboration." This article describes that collaboration.
(S//SI) NSA and GCHQ are teaming on a comprehensive collaboration on exploitation of terrestrial RF (radio frequency) communications in a program known as the Joint Strategic OffAir Programme (Joint Programme). This effort has already made an impact on the SIGINT mission and recently was applied to provide the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) an assessment of communications security of the U.S. forces in Iraq.
(S//SI) The Joint Programme was established in December 2002 with a groundbreaking Principles of Agreement signed by the Directors of NSA and GCHQ. NSA is revitalizing its terrestrial RF collection capability by leveraging GCHQ's developing HF/VHF/UHF collection architecture known as GLAIVE. To meet U.S. intelligence needs, GLAIVE systems were deployed to Kuwait before the start of military operations in Iraq and then to Balad, Iraq in December 2003. These systems provide the SIGINT mission with access to local communications for force protection and also significant regional collection.
(S//SI) On April 14, 2004, (an NSA member of the Joint Programme executive board) and (Corporate HF Services (CHS, S3311), briefed the Joint COMSEC Monitoring Activity (JCMA, I422) on GLAIVE capabilities and current signals access.
(S//SI) As a result of that briefing, JCMA contacted CHS on 22 April with a request to task the VHF/UHF receivers on the GLAIVE remote collection facility (RCF) in Balad, Iraq. HF Mission Management coordinated logistics and receiver availability with their GCHQ counterparts while JCMA drafted and submitted the requisite SURREY requirement, provided frequencies and signal routing information, and forwarded legal certification to perform the mission. On 24 April, using the GLAIVE workstations located in the Meade Operations Center to access the RCF in Balad, Iraq (via the RAF Digby remote operations facility), JCMA began monitoring Family Radio Service (FRS) and Global Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) radios being used by deployed U.S. personnel.
(C) This initiative is an outstanding example of SID/IAD collaboration and joint mission management with GCHQ, which resulted in a mission coming on line in less than $21 / 2$ working days. JCMA continues to monitor the FRS/GMRS frequencies on a not-to-interfere basis and report results to their COMSEC customer.
(C) This exercise is not only an example of SID and IAD working together to keep our troops safe, but it also brings GCHQ into the equation as we begin living the vision of Transformation 2.01
