(U//FOUO) Labor Day (September 6th) is fast approaching. To mark the holiday, we thought it would be interesting to know some of the more unusual jobs that NSAers had in a "former life." If we get enough responses, we will post the results in an article. Send an email to @nsa and @nsa with YOUR noteworthy former job title. Looking forward to hearing from you!
