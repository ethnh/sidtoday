(C) Charlie Meals Opens New Engineering Support Facility in Japan

FROM:
Pacific Technical Center (F412)
Run Date: 07/21/2004
(C//SI) With an enviable track record of providing unique, ad hoc and quick-reaction repair and fabrication of SIGINT collection antennas and related communications equipment throughout Asia and the Pacific for the past 40 years, NCRJ's* Engineering Support Facility reached another major milestone this year when it moved into its new quarters at Yokota Air Base, Japan.

The ribbon cutting ceremony.
(C//SI) Officially opened by Mr. Charlie Meals, this state of the art $\$ 6.6$ million, 32,430 square foot facility, paid for almost entirely by the Government of Japan with NSA "kicking" in $\$ 939 \mathrm{~K}$ for internal fit-up, the ESF now has sufficient room, utilities and infrastructure to support all its material, machinery and cadre of 7 designers, machinists, RF specialist professionals (whose salaries - amounting to approximately $\$ 375 \mathrm{~K}$ annually - are also paid entirely by the Government of Japan).

The grand opening.
(C) Functions and facilities within the ESF include:

- an 150' X 45' antenna fabrication facility capable of accommodating large 2MHz-30MHz Bicon Antenna
$\qquad$
a carpentry shop for crating, jigs and limited composite fabrication
$\qquad$
- a machinist facility capable of machining custom metal and composite components
$\qquad$
- a welding room to include state of the art TIG, MIG and plasma cutting tools.
$\qquad$
- a paint booth capable of accommodating 8 meter long antenna components
- and an extensive storage area for raw stock and long lead items necessary to support quick reaction requirements.
(TS//SI) The new facility is co-located with the DoD Special Representative Japan (DSRJ). Despite having to juggle moving into the new facility, closing the old facility at Camp Zama, and setting up current operations, the ESF team -- led by
(NCRJ/F41221) -- has continued its efforts to provide world-class service to Asia, Pacific, and indeed to the world outside our AOR*. Most notable production to date includes 20 TURNSTYLE collars for antennas to support the al-Qa'ida spring offensive in Afghanistan, several 0.8 - 2.5 GHz LPA antennas for the PENCUP project to upgrade the DETs in Korea, and an EMI mitigation device for the INDRA UPS mitigation project in Thailand. Ongoing projects include the production of 8 stainless steel 30 - 150 MHz LPA antennas for FLAMINGO .
(S/SI) The ESF facility and its talented workforce will always be at the forefront of providing antenna repair and fabrication to the theater as well to the Balkans campaign, Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), counter-narcotics operations in Central and South America, collection equipment in Cyprus as well as anywhere else with a requirement for quick reaction, specialty RF products of the high quality they have become known for.

NCRJ = NSA/CSS Representative Japan
AOR = Area of Responsibility
