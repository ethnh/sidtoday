(S//SI) The worldwide wireless LAN market is rapidly expanding. The exploding popularity of wireless communications has resulted in a high volume of packet data that often seems impossible to process. DRAGONVIEW was developed to meet this challenge, and gives analysts a powerful new way to look at their targets and process packet data more quickly.
(S//SI) DRAGONVIEW is a visualization tool developed within Tailored Access Operations' (TAOs') Hardware Bridging Office (HBO). DRAGONVIEW is currently used to analyze wireless network data collected from several SIGINT collection systems targeted at the various flavors of 802.11 traffic. The tool will currently display data to show both logical and physical aspects of the data collected during surveys.
(S//SI) DRAGONVIEW can process SIGINT data collected from systems BEECOASTAL, OMINA, VINEYARD, FLOODSCOPE, and MOONSHINE.
(S//SI) DRAGONVIEW is a stand-alone application used to process survey collection data. In addition to supporting the formats from the SIGINT collectors listed above, DRAGONVIEW can also process tcpdump and files generated by COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) products such as AiroPeek. DRAGONVIEW also has its own native format called DRAGONVIEW File Format (DFF).
(S//SI) DRAGONVIEW uses RENOIR and GraphViz to display logical network diagrams. If GPS coordinate data is recorded by the collection system, OpenMap is used to display the survey device's drive path.
