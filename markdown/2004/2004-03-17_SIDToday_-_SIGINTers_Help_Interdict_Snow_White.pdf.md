(C//SI) Keen analysis and fast action by SIGINTers at CSG Key West enabled the U.S. Coast Guard to seize a boat carrying 3.2 metric tons of cocaine during the weekend of 6-7 March. This incident began when a CSG COMINT watchstander analyzed incoming counter-narcotics reports and concluded that it was possible to positively identify and locate the drug-laden ship. The CSG quickly tipped the Coast Guard, who ordered the cutter Boutwell to turn around and speed to the area of activity in the Eastern Pacific.
(C//SI) When the crew of the Boutwell arrived in the area, they found two fishing boats ... which was the "right" one? The watchstander again correctly analyzed the situation and advised the Coast Guard as to which of the two boats was carrying the drugs. Upon boarding, USCG personnel found the cocaine still on the boat's deck and in the cabin. Their confidence in the SIGINT reporting and analysis was well rewarded!
(C//SI) So far this year, SANDKEY** counter-narcotics reporting has directly resulted in the seizure of 16 metric tons of cocaine, which represents more than half of the amount seized during all of last year based on this source. The entire SANDKEY community should be applauded for their great work.
(S//SI) Besides the above bust, NSA advance warning of an impending Colombia-Brazil arms-for-drugs shipment the same weekend allowed JIATF-S (Joint Inter-Agency Task Force - South, in Key West) analysts to track an aircraft and provide the information to the Colombian Air Force. As a result, the Colombians were able to destroy the returning aircraft on the ground under the conditions of the Air Bridge Denial Program. This was the second aircraft in as many weeks destroyed because of such radar correlation to SIGINT products.
(S//SI) In addition, last month's arrest of FARC (a Colombian insurgent group) financial leader "Sonya" and a number of her associates resulted from years of monitoring her movements and modus operandi. Accurate geolocational data as to where she was and when, allowed a vetted Colombian team to capture them by surprise and without any loss of life.
(U) Well done to all involved!
