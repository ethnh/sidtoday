NSA Liaison Officer to the TTIC (F51)
(U//FOUO) It has been over 10 months since the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC) came into existence. The initial complement of 50 officers has grown to a current strength of about 260 U.S. government staff and contractors. TTIC personnel are preparing to move in the late May-early June time frame to the state-of-the-art headquarters in Northern Virginia that they will share with elements of the DCI Counterterrorism Center and the FBI's Counterterrorism Division.
(U//FOUO) In fulfillment of its mission to provide a comprehensive picture of the international terrorist threat, TTIC produces the President's Terrorist Threat Report (PTTR) six days a week; the PTTR has a very limited executive distribution and is one of two documents that the President wants at his breakfast table every day. TTIC also produces on a daily basis the Threat Matrix and two Situational Summaries as well as a variety of other publications on an as-needed basis, such as Intelligence Community assessments/advisories, Spot Commentaries, Senior Executive Intelligence Briefs, and TTIC Special Analysis Reports.
(U//FOUO) TTIC has four key initiatives that go to the core of its mission:

- Information sharing on terrorist threat : TTIC, working with DHS and FBI, has established a joint Program Office to oversee implementation of the March 2003 Homeland Security Information Sharing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), signed by the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of Central Intelligence. The challenges of this office include such issues as establishing standards for tear lines, reaching out to non-Intelligence Community agencies, and rethinking reporting standards.
- TTIC Online : Already extending to over 2,500 users at every major department and agency involved in the war against terrorism, TTIC Online currently operates at a very high classification level and contains TTIC's most sensitive information as well as that produced by other components of the U.S. Government. Over the coming months it will be replicated on less sensitive networks and will ultimately extend to a "sensitive but unclassified" (SBU) version that will allow FBI and DHS to make SBU material available to state and local governments, law enforcement entities, and the private sector.
- Advanced Analytic Techniques : TTIC is acutely aware of the challenge of correlating data that might be found in finished production, as well as disseminated or nondisseminated reporting, and perhaps even hard drives coming from the caves of Afghanistan. TTIC has recently stood up a team to focus on the advanced analytic techniques necessary to confront the terrorist threat. TTIC is working with the public and private sectors to develop the tools necessary to most efficiently and comprehensively store, retrieve, analyze, and exploit such data, thus providing the capability to look for hidden linkages that simply would not be discoverable otherwise.
- Identities Database : TTIC is directed by both the DCI Directive 2/4 and the recently signed Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 6 to "maintain an up-to-date database of known and suspected terrorists accessible to appropriate government officials." TTIC, working with other appropriate government departments and agencies, has been developing such a terrorist identities database that will incorporate all information concerning such individuals' association with international terrorism. The FBI will continue to manage information that has been determined to be purely domestic
terrorism, with both sources of information available to the new Terrorist Screening Center.
(U//FOUO) Weathering the initial storm of skepticism and criticism, TTIC is here to stay! It has an undeniable raison d'etre and a core of dedicated personnel from 16 government agencies as well as the contractor world, who work day and night to fulfill the TTIC mission.
