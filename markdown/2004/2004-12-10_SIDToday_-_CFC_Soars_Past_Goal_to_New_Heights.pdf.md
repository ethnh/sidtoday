(U) CFC Soars Past Goal to New Heights

FROM:
CFC Keyworker for SID
Run Date: 12/10/2004
(U) To add more good cheer this holiday season, NSA'ers can celebrate the fact that the $\$ 1.6$ million goal for the CFC has been surpassed. Approximately 20\% of the NSA workforce contributed to the campaign and, while the final tally won't be completed until after the new year, it looks like NSA contributions will exceed $\$ 1.7$ million.
(U) The statistics (see the report ) for SID are just as impressive. SID surpassed its goal for the campaign with $108 \%$ and an overall participation rate of sixteen percent. Since all the contributions from SID have not yet been tallied, we expect our contribution rate to increase as well. All contributors, canvassers, keyworkers and coordinators can feel proud to have taken part in this activity as it will benefit many people long after the holidays are over. My thanks to each of you for taking on this additional responsibility.
(U) I'd also like to congratulate SID employee 000000000 from S2. One of the CFC activities was to guess the number of candies inside a huge glass jar. Without even seeing the jar (he only viewed it on the web). 000000000 guessed the exact amount of candy inside -- 1266. Well done
(U) Remember, it is not too late to be a part of the giving. Even though the official campaign is over, donations and contributions are still being accepted until 31 December. If you have any questions or you would still like to contribute, contact 00000000000 on either 0000000 or 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
