(S//SI) In the coming months, U.S. military and intelligence personnel will begin a Spring Offensive in the Afghanistan-Pakistan area intended to locate and eliminate the al-Qa'ida leadership. We in NSA have no higher priority than to support this Spring Offensive, and we must be prepared.
(S//SI) As a result, today NSA will host a Rock Drill focused on this offensive. The Rock Drill will bring together principal customers, key elements from NSA/HQ, and members of the Extended Enterprise to review Intelligence Needs and to synchronize roles and responsibilities of the organizations and people that will be directly involved.
(S//SI) The Rock Drill will pay particular attention to planning and our SIGINT "command and control," so that we are set up to make decisions quickly and clearly. We will continue what we are already doing in the Global War on Terrorism, while adding a few additional positions. The details will be worked out after today's Rock Drill, at which time a SIGINT Operational Plan will be finalized. That said, we have already determined the following:

1. (S//SI) The MENA/South Asia Issue Management Team will be the lead IMT for the Spring Offensive, with full support from the Counterterrorism IMT. The MENA/South Asia IMT will reside in NSOC and, from there, lead a Spring Offensive Executive Steering Team with SID and IA membership.
2. (S//SI) Senior NSA representatives will be posted to Kabul/Bagram, Afghanistan and to Islamabad, Pakistan to work with both CIA and CENTCOM personnel on issues related to the Spring Offensive. Both representatives will report to the NCR CENTCOM. These positions have been identified and will be named soon.
(S//SI) I understand that meeting the challenges of the Spring Offensive while maintaining focus on other high-priority missions will not be easy. We must keep in mind that this effort may not be a quick brute-force operation like Operation Iraqi Freedom's march to Baghdad -- it could take eight days or eight months. We will be forced to make hard risk-management decisions about the use of resources and take full advantage of operational opportunities as they arise.
(U//FOUO) I know I can count on all of you for your full support to these critical operations. Here is a real opportunity to make a decisive and lasting contribution to our nation's security.
