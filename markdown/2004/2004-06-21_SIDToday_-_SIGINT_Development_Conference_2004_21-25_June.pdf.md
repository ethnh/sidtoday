(U//FOUO) The 2004 SIGDEV Conference begins today with a keynote speech from Mr. William B. Black in the Friedman Auditorium. This is followed by State of SIGINT Development reports by SIGDEV Leaders from NSA, GCHQ, CSE, DSD and GCSB.
(C) For the remainder of the week delegates will be able to choose from almost 100 briefings, demonstrations and tours provided by presenters from NSA, GCHQ, CSE, DSD, US Military Units, National Ground Intelligence Center and National Geospatial Intelligence Agency integrees at NSA.
(S//SI) On offer are six main workshop threads:

- SIGDEV Support to Tactical Operations and Force Protection
- Non-SIGINT Support to SIGDEV
- Network Analysis
- Unified Events Analysis \& Discovering New Targets
- Broadband Access and Survey
- Locating Targets
(C//SI) On top of these workshops, delegates will also have the opportunity to attend miniworkshops on Social Network Analysis and Target Templating.
(U//FOUO) With the theme of "Discovering the Future" the aim of the Conference is to bring together experts from around the world to discuss the toughest SIGINT Development problems facing the SIGDEV community. It is also an opportunity to showcase some of the successes achieved by the community.
(C) If you are interested in joining almost 640 SIGINT Development delegates from around the World, visit the Conference webpages at http://www.srtd.do.nsa/SD2004/ to see what is on offer.
(U//FOUO) If you are unable to attend in person and are one of the 1600+ SIGDEV Learning Portal users, you will be interested to learn that arrangements have been made to have highinterest presentations videotaped for publication on the See It Now/Again portion of the portal.
(U//FOUO) Of course, such a large event would not be possible without a great deal of assistance and it is gratifying to note that a number of individuals from across SID have willingly volunteered their services to help the three conference organizers.
