(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce the second of what will be monthly brown bag discussions focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest.
(U//FOUO) The presenters will be experts from the Target Analysis Center (TAC), Network Analysis Center (NAC), Target Technology Trends Center (T3C) and occasionally the SSG staff. We believe that these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT development, or are interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT development activities.
(U//FOUO) This month's featured speakers are Ms. Elizabeth Mossberg, Technical Director, and Mr. and the target Technology Trends Center. A synopsis of their topic for discussion is provided below:
(S//SI) "What technologies will our SIGINT intelligence targets use in FY2007-2011?"
(S//SI) That's the question that the Target Technology Trends Center (T3C) will answer during this talk. Our presentation will be the culmination of months of research and analysis in support of SID's annual budget build -- all aimed at helping to posture SID against strategic surprise. We rely heavily on the expertise of A\&P target offices, DA technologists, 2nd Party, Community and Field experts, private industry, and academia. We also use all source material to track the indicators of change in the current and planned usage of technologies by our targets. The stronger the target evidence, the more certain SID is that its technology developments and investments are on track. This talk will provide information on our analytical methodologies as well as the information that you need to know to track your intelligence targets and prepare your anticipatory developments.
