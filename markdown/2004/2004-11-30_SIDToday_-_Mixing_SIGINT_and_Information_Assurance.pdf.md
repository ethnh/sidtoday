(U//FOUO) Mixing SIGINT and Information Assurance
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA Signals Intelligence Director Run Date: 11/30/2004
(U//FOUO) There have been some major milestones recently as SID and the Information Assurance Directorate collaborate ever more closely:

# NTOC 

(U//FOUO) As Lt Gen Hayden announced in a recent DIRGram, SID and the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) are joining forces to create an "NSA Threat Operations Center ." The NTOC will be NSA's operational analysis center for detecting unauthorized activity, attacks, intrusions, and other threats to the DoD's vital computer networks. The Center will be able to view, real-time, changes to these networks.
(S//SI) Two existing organizations will merge to form the NTOC:

- The NSA Threat Analysis Center (NTAC) -- a joint IAD/SID effort that assesses and reports indicators of hostile threats from foreign individuals, groups, or intelligence services against U.S. information systems.
- The Data/Network Operations Center (DNOC) -- a SIGDev_organization that provides a real-time view of target computer systems. It gathers this information from all available sources, including SIGINT collection.

The NTOC will also bring together technologists working on both SID's MASTERLINK and IAD's BLUESASH programs, which perform Attack Sensing \& Warning / Indications \& Warning missions.
(U//FOUO) Combining all of these SID and IAD efforts into the NTOC will give NSA a focal point for dealing with these threats, and allow the Agency to streamline our operations into the most efficient system possible. $\square$ and Vergleich Gipson will be the SID integrees on a team that will put together the plan to make the NTOC a reality. The team will also include personnel from IAD and SIGDev. We expect a detailed implementation plan within the next 60 days.

## New IAD-SID Senior Liaison Officer

(U//FOUO) On November 5th, $\square$ became the first-ever IAD-SID Senior Liaison Officer. She will:

1. identify areas and opportunities for collaboration and teaming between IAD and SID.
2. introduce and raise the awareness of Information Assurance (the other IA) into SID, and vice versa.
3. facilitate the exchange of people between SID and IAD.
(U//FOUO) How can you contribute? Look for opportunities where SID and IAD could and should collaborate and bring them to $\square$ s attention. Highlight and build on existing successes. will provide IA awareness briefings in the coming months -- attend them. If you have questions about IA products and services, ask her. If you'd like to know more about IAD job opportunities, temporary and permanent, ask her.
(U//FOUO) This position is not intended to be a funnel into IAD nor to replace existing processes and contacts, but to enhance the teaming and collaboration between SID and IAD. It directly supports Transformation 2.0.
(U//FOUO) can be reached at $\square$ or visit her in 2N006. She will hold this job for
12 months, at which time Dan Wolf (IA Director) and I will assess the value and decide to either continue with another senior detailee or discontinue the position.

# Conclusion 

(U//FOUO) We anticipate that SID and IAD will continue to find ways to work together, with our joint operations being better than the proverbial "sum of our parts." We will keep you informed of our progress!
(U//FOUO) SID and IAD have instituted a job exchange program. See the SID/IAD Job Exchange Website for further details.
