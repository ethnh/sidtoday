(U//FOUO) We received the following letter in response to the recent article Before and After: Headed for Baghdad :
(U//FOUO) From:
Comment: Thank you for your informative article on Mark Cronin's preparation for NCR Baghdad. I just want to add one correction -- during Mark's 20 May visit to NCR/CSG State, we scheduled a 20 minute courtesy call with Ambassador Negroponte. Mark was able to sit with Ambassador Negroponte for 20 minutes and discuss the Ambassador's SIGINT needs.
