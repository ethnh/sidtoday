(U//FOUO) The 2004 Summer Olympic Games were held 13-29 August 2004 in Athens, Greece. Athletes from over 200 countries participated in the Games themselves; over 150 heads of State or heads of government attended at least one Olympic event; and over 5 billion people watched the Olympics on television or followed it on the Internet. The Olympic venues were located throughout Greece, including Athens, Crete, Volos, Patra, Olympia, and Thessaloniki. Such an important international event with a worldwide audience wrapped to their television and PCs for two weeks presented a very tempting target for terrorists.

(S//SI) Well before the start of the Summer Games, NSA began supporting Intelligence Community efforts to:

- provide Force Protection/Indication and Warning of imminent, indigenous and transnational threats to U.S. interests in the Olympic area of responsibility (AOR);
- develop an awareness of the Greek Government's knowledge of threats to the Games and or U.S. interests;
- understand how countries bordering Greece were prepared to respond to a potential attack; and,
- support the U.S. Military in any operation to provide assistance to the Greek Government and/or evacuate U.S. entities from the area.
(S//SI) To accomplish this herculean task, NSA personnel, at the heart of the action in Athens, were working very closely with the State Department, which was responsible for providing security for U.S. Olympic officials, judges and athletes -- at the sporting events, the Olympic Village and aboard cruise ships in Piraeus Harbor serving as floating hotels. From the Olympic AOR, around the world and back to the Fort, NSA personnel were manning 24-hour watches and operations while working with Home Land Security, the FBI, NGA, CIA and DIA, as well as EUCOM and SOCOM in support of NATO. NSA support to the 2004 Summer Games encompassed a wide range of offices to include:
- the Information Assurance Directorate (IAD),
- Installations and Logistics (I\&L),
- Information Technology Infrastructure Services (ITIS),
- Counterterrorism (CT),
- International Security Issues (ISI),
- Customer Relationships (S1),
- the National Security Operations Center (NSOC),
- Tailored Access,
- Link Access,
- Cryptanalysis and Exploitation (CES),
- Geocell,
- our Second Party partners, and many more.
(S//SI) A shining example of focused mission support to the Games was that being provided by the Link Access Support to the Olympics (LASO) team. Comprised of subject matter experts from the Office of Overhead (OH), Radio Frequency Operations (RFO), Special Collection Service (SCS) and Special Source Operations (SSO), the LASO team was the focal point for everything Olympics -- from planning to resource allocation through collection management and crisis response -- for all Olympics security operations. LA team members supported the SID Olympics
team for more than 10 months, and were in place well before the opening ceremonies.
(S//SI) NSA/CSS Olympic operations included several major initiatives within LA spanning its accesses: BLUE FORCE TRACKING, SCS and SSO. SCS support included the activities of US966G and two survey sites (US-969X183 and US-969X202). SSO support included deployment of access capabilities (APRIL FLOWERS) to directly support the Olympics. LA Olympic Operations and the LASO Team concept were just a small part of the larger corporate effort to the XXVIII Summer Olympiad made possible with the hard work and dedication of many NSA organizations working together to achieve a common goal -- a safe Olympics!
