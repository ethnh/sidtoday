(U//FOUO) Justifying Expenditures of Money and Time: Acquisition Analysis

FROM: Kevan L. Barton

(U//FOUO) (Note: If you are in the Acquisition \& Business Management Skill Community or work on any program, read below about an important Acquisition Analysis workshop.)
(U//FOUO) June 2003 was a watershed month, or one of infamy. Your opinion depends on which side of the acquisition fence you sit philosophically. This was the month that the new JCIDS* documents (CJCSI3170) arrived at NSA's doors and described for us the process that the DoD expects us to use to identify capability gaps, describe prospective solutions, and justify expenditures.
(U//FOUO) If you are of the old school at NSA, where you throw money to bridge the capability gaps you've identified, then you hated June 2003. If, however, you are of the school that believes that money must be justly and rightly spent on proven capability gap solutions, then June 2003 was a banner month: wisdom in the acquisition process had indeed arrived!
(U//FOUO) But, even if you are of the positive ilk, the JCIDS documents describe a process, but give scant direction on how to carry it off. Take for example the acquisition analysis piece (read Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)), which the documents state must be part of an acquisition program's history. An AoA is required for ACAT 1, ACAT 1A, and Major Acquisition of Information System (MAIS) solution programs. The documents reference parent documents such as DoDI 5000.2, which in turn reference the Clinger-Cohen act, but no specific guidance is provided on exactly how to pull off the AoA. 5000.2 even goes so far as to state that the AoA is required because it helps justify expenditure by considering how a capability gap solution,

- Illuminates capability advantages and disadvantages
- Considers joint operational plans
- Examines sufficient feasible alternatives
- Discusses key assumptions and variables and sensitivity to changes in these
- Assesses technology risk and maturity
- Calculates costs
(U//FOUO) How do we, then, reconcile the requirement for acquisition analysis with the lack of guidance on how to do it? There is a solution on the horizon. You are invited to attend a workshop entitled "Acquisition Analysis (AoA) for Conceptual IT Solutions within the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS)". The workshop will be held at nearby JHU/APL from 5 to 7 October. The workshop is your opportunity to see the results of cross-organizational efforts to develop an NSA policy and manual for conducting acquisition analysis for IT-based systems, learn how to conduct an AoA, or even to provide your two-cents worth to the AoA manual. The workshop presenters come from within NSA, the broader acquisition community, the military, and academia. For workshop agenda and registration details, contact Kevan L. Barton (contact info below).
(U//FOUO) If you are in the Acquisition \& Business Management Skill Community, the workshop is a must. If you are working on any program (e.g. transformation activity like CMM, TRAILBLAZER, etc.), it is paramount.
(U//FOUO) Acquisition analysis is here to stay. It makes sense. It isn't as onerous as you'd expect. We hope to see you at the workshop.
