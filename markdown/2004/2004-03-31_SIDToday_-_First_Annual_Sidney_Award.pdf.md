(U//FOUO) Over the past year, scores of contributors have submitted hundreds of articles to SID today . A number of these articles received very positive feedback - clearly we have some excellent writers among us! SIGINT Communications would like to honor one of these authors with an informal award for writing the article most appreciated by the workforce. This award will be known as the "Sidney" Award, and we'd like you to choose the winner.
(U//FOUO) Was there one article in particular that sticks in your mind from the last 12 months? One you found particularly fascinating, well written or important? If so, please let us know. Make note of the article's title and the date it ran, and send it to $\square$ @nsa and $\square$ @nsa. (You can use the search function in the SID today archives to help track down the article you have in mind.) Please submit your vote by COB Friday. Thank you for participating!
