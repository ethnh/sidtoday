(C) The Global Network Forum (Update \#1)

FROM: $\square$ GCHQ Integree
Link Access Planning and Requirements Division (S3341)
Run Date: 10/22/2004
(C) For more on the Global Network Forum, see the articles 5-Eyes Global Network Forum, and Data Acquisition Update .
(U) Why do we need the Global Network Forum?
(S//SI) Prior to the GNF there were a number of access-related forums that addressed strategic and tactical planning challenges, but only from a stovepipe perspective. During the last Comsat Planning Forum (CPF) in November 2003 the delegates realized that if targets were to be tracked successfully the challenge must be addressed from a global perspective, and the only way to achieve that was through the establishment of an access related Global Network Forum. It was then unanimously agreed that the CPF would be disbanded and the Global Network Forum established with a goal of holding the first meeting in June of 2004.
(S//SI) To make things more interesting, it was decided that not only would the GNF be established by June of 2004, but it would also be tasked with addressing a high priority need within the Link Access Programs group. One such challenge, gently simmering away, was the sticky subject of Sensitive Data Sharing, a theme that fell in line with one of the principles defined in the 5-Eyes SIGINT Partnership Business Vision -- The 5-Eyes SIGINT Enterprise will subscribe to sharing as the preferred default option. Successfully identifying a mechanism that allows the sharing of sensitive information between partners would ultimately enhance all accesses and permit the appropriate dissemination of relevant data between intra-agency organizations and inter-agency partners, critical to the success of exploiting the global network to satisfy customer requirements.
(S//SI) Through a great deal of background work between the 5-EYES partners, the initial GNF Charter was drafted, the structure of the GNF identified, and the principles of sensitive data sharing established through the drafting of the "Tiered Approach to Sensitive Data Sharing" document.
(U//FOUO) So, what have we achieved so far?
(C) Here's a list of the major agreements reached by partners during the conference:

- The Charter and governance structure of the GNF was ratified
- Agreement was reached on the formation of two new 5-Eyes bodies, subordinate to the GNF:
- The Special Source Advisory Board (SSAB)
- The Collection Management Advisory Board (CMAB)
- Agreement on the "Tiered Approach to Sensitive Data Sharing" proposal
- The SSAB were charged with defining a new 5-Eyes ECI to support the new agreement by December 2004, a task that is well on the way to completion.
- Agreement on updates to the existing TICKETWINDOW CONOP* with an implementation plan to be presented to the GNF in December 04. (TICKETWINDOW was established to enable reciprocal data sharing with Second Party partners without jeopardizing sensitive sources and methods).
(C) All are significant achievements, and ones that will improve our ability to develop a cohesive strategic vision for the 5-Eyes Intelligence Community across global network accesses and further strengthen the partnership between agencies.
(U//FOUO) So, where do we go from here?
(U//FOUO) Since that groundbreaking meeting we haven't rested on our laurels, and continue to push forward on the actions from that forum and with preparations for the next conference to be held at NSAW. Planning is now underway for the next GNF, 6th through 8th December, where we will be discussing, among other things, the implementation plan for the TICKETWINDOW updates, debating the options for including additional accesses into the GNF, reviewing the terms of reference for the CMAB and SSAB, and attempting to identify commonality between partners on the definition of a Global Access Map.
(U//FOUO) Again, a great deal of background work will be carried out with partners prior to the forum to ensure we can reach agreement points promptly and cover the wide range of topics on the agenda in the short time we have available. So, keep a look out on "SID today " for another follow-up article after the December conference, and we'll tell you what agreements have been reached and what new challenges the GNF has set itself to address.
