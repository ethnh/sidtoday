(U) Christopher Columbus learned that the world is not flat. With Columbus Day approaching, we thought it would be interesting to ask the work force if they had found certain SIGINT "myths" to be false. For example, over the years many have discovered that there is no "traffic fairy" in the basement.
(U) Are you aware of any other myths? Let us know by 1500 tomorrow, using the "Submit an Item / SIDToday article" function (on the right-hand side of the SID today homepage).
