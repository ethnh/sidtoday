(U//FOUO) D\&D Awareness at NSA
FROM:
SID Intelligence Security Issues (S02L3)
Run Date: 07/13/2004
(U//FOUO) On Thursday 8 July, Dr. Larry Gershwin, NIO for Intelligence Assurance and Chairman of the DCI Foreign Denial \& Deception Committee (FDDC), presented an Executive Denial \& Deception Overview briefing in the Friedman Auditorium and received a SID coin from SID Chief of Staff Charles Berlin at the meeting's close.
(S) Critique comments from Dr. Gershwin's presentation reiterated the importance of D\&D in daily analysis and stressed that D\&D training should be provided to even the most junior analysts. To increase NSA's D\&D awareness, several classes are available to analysts to enhance their D\&D skills. Please look for the following D\&D offerings through the National Cryptologic School:

- DENL 1011 - D\&D Awareness Training (3 hrs.)
- DENL 2111 - Adversarial D\&D Analysis Course (40 hrs.)
- DENL 3211 - Special Topics in D\&D (4 hr. seminars)
(S) To further increase D\&D awareness, we have made NSA's Countering D\&D
