(U) SIGINT Users' Conference 2004 Wrap-Up
FROM:
Information Needs and Outcomes (S111)
Run Date: 09/15/2004
(U//FOUO) The SIGINT Users' Conference , hosted by SIRVES, DIA, and NSA, was held at FGGM from 19 through 23 July 2004. Prior to the conference, attendees registered on-line, to include:

- The Combatant Commands (CENTCOM, EUCOM, NORTHCOM, PACOM, SOUTHCOM, JFCOM, SOCOM, STRATCOM, TRANSCOM);
- Other agencies, including CIA, DIA, National Air and Space Intelligence Center, National Ground Intelligence Center, National Missile Intelligence Center, and Office of Naval Intelligence; and
- NSA's SID, MRSOC, GRSOC and Denver Field Station personnel.

The approximately 175 attendees had an opportunity to choose from 23 different presentations, as well as panel discussions, demonstrations, tours and training sessions.
(U//FOUO) Experts from the SID Operations Staff, SID Customer Relationships Management, Analysis \& Production, and Data Acquisition, among others, provided overviews and discussed the processes and challenges associated with producing SIGINT. They explained how the entire Intelligence Community works together gathering requirements, assigning sensors, collecting and analyzing data, then disseminating SIGINT to the users.
(U) Was the event a success? Here's a sampling of comments from those who attended: "AWESOME" ..."Great rundown of the SIGINT process" ..."Good background for collection managers" ..."Interesting in that there will be further development of some of the sub-topics, particularly customer feedback"..."Outstanding! This information needs to reach the field" ..."All good briefs, especially target trends - area often overlooked" ..."Very stimulating. Good Questions" ..."Outstanding brief" ..."The Panel Discussions were a good way for NSA to meet the Collection Managers from the S \& T Centers and Commands" ... "Worthwhile conference [which] should happen annually".
(U//FOUO) Based on feedback from conference attendees, next year's conference will be aimed more specifically at collection managers. The collection managers also requested that more customer-TOPI* interface in small group discussions be incorporated in a future conference. Post-conference action items centered on collection managers' requests for more information sharing from NSA, as well as their recommendations that certain SIGINT procedures be revisited or clarified. Soon, the "lessons learned" and actions resulting from the conference will be posted to NSANet and INTELINK for visibility and tracking.
