(U) Changes Coming to the USSID System

New USSIDs being drafted; re-grouping and re-numbering of USSIDs proposed (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) Have you ever consulted a United States Signals Intelligence Directive (USSID) and found information to be wrong, outdated, or missing? Have you or your management wondered how to best standardize SIGINT production processes no matter where in the U.S. SIGINT System (USSS) they're performed? Help is on the way! SIGINT Policy has a team that is working with mission experts throughout the USSS to re-engineer the USSID system to ensure that it directs today's SIGINT production processes, and that USSIDs are easy to find and use.
(U//FOUO) The USSID re-engineering effort started almost two years ago with a focus on providing the doctrine that is the foundation of the USSID system. That doctrine exists in the Cryptologic Doctrine and SIGINT Keystone documents. Now that the Doctrine and Keystone documents are in place, SIGINT Policy is focused on refurbishing and enhancing the detailed directives for the SIGINT production process -- the USSID system.
(U//FOUO) USSID 1, "SIGINT Operating Policy," details the authorities that allow us to legally perform our SIGINT missions, and specifically states that "DIRNSA/CHCSS uses the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive (USSID) System to control the operations of the USSS." It also declares that only USSIDs, or vehicles authorized in USSIDs, are used to direct SIGINT operations of the USSS.
(U//FOUO) USSID 2, " The USSID System," explains how the USSID system is structured and administered, and details the processes for initiating new USSIDs and for modifying or canceling existing USSIDs. USSID 2 will soon be updated to support the implementation of USSID reengineering, which will make the USSID system more accurate, current, and flexible.
(U//FOUO) USSID re-engineering is now underway, and has two main aspects:

- (U//FOUO) The first is the identification and closure of gaps -- current operational processes that are inadequately covered in USSIDs. For the last six months, the Reengineering Team has consulted with subject matter experts across SID to identify and prioritize major SIGINT processes that need to be addressed in USSIDs. SID Policy and the SID deputy directorates are collaborating to close these gaps, resulting in several new draft USSIDs and revisions of existing USSIDs.
- (U//FOUO) The second is the proposed implementation of a new structure for organizing USSIDs, to include re-grouping and re-numbering USSIDs to make them easier to locate by subject. Details of the proposal are being briefed to the deputy directorates. If approved, implementation of the new structure will begin as soon as April 2005, after an aggressive effort to educate the USSS workforce and coordinate with all concerned organizations to ensure a trouble-free transition. Further details are available at the USSID Re-engineering Web Site.
(U//FOUO) The goal of the USSID Re-engineering Team is to ensure that USSIDs are an accurate source of information for governing the SIGINT Enterprise of today and tomorrow from Headquarters to the Extended Enterprise.
(U//FOUO) The Re-engineering Team is recruiting additional personnel to spearhead its work on S1 and S2 related USSIDs, and welcomes questions from interested candidates. As reengineering efforts continue, additional information will be disseminated to the NSA/CSS workforce, partners, and customers. Please email the USSID Re-engineering Team at "DL
