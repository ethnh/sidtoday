(U//FOUO) Did you ever talk to President Reagan? (Perhaps you met him when he came to NSA to dedicate building 2B?) Or did you have dealings with him indirectly, through the White House staff? If so, we'd like to hear your story! We'll include it in the "Insider's View of History" series. Send an e-mail to $\square$ @nsa and $\square$ nsa, or use the "Submit an Item" / "SIDToday article" function on the SID today homepage. Hope to hear from you!
