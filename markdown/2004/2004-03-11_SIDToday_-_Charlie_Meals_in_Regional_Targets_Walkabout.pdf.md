Chief, SIGINT Development and Critical Global Targets (S2A1)
(S) On 7 January 2004 Mr. Charlie Meals, Deputy Chief of SID, spent the afternoon visiting the SIGDEV and Critical Global Targets Division (S2A1) in the Regional Targets (RT) Product Line. Although time was limited, Mr. Meals met most of the division workforce and engaged in lively discussions regarding the division's three missions: International Organzations, Sensitive Weather Intelligence, and RT SIGDEV.
(S) Mr. Meals' first stop was to the Sensitive Weather Branch where he received an update from Mr. $\square$ Branch Chief, on the automation of many processes and what is being done to increase the dissemination of this information to their ever-growing customer set. One of Mr. Meals first assignments at NSA some years ago was to the Weather Desk in NSOC which explains his deep interest in that mission.
(S) The International Organizations Branch Branch Chief, Ms. $\square$, then provided an overview of their own unique mission. Technical Leader Ms. IA Intern Mr. $\square$ and Subject Matter Expert Ms. $\square$ each discussed the targets and associated responsibilities. Mr. Meals was particularly interested in the background of each, asking many questions about their careers and job satisfaction.
(S) Finally, Mr. Meals visited the two SIGDEV branches where the branch chiefs, MSgt Ann Warwick and Mr. $\square$ briefed their specific missions followed by specific discussions with various members of each branch. The discussions included the division of effort to do TCOM research against several Africa countries by Team Chief Mr. ARCVIEW projects by one of the division's SIGDEV contractors, and the initiatives to fill much-needed linguistic gaps by several others.
(U//FOUO) Those who met Mr. Meals were very appreciative that he would take the time to visit, and he was equally impressed with their complete dedication to the missions and how the analysts and reporters work together to successfully prosecute each mission despite resource needs. His questions focused on issues that are of concern to everyone, asking about resources, interns, SIGDEV contractors, training, and leveraging the Extended Enterprise, especially the RSOCs.
(U//FOUO) The division members very much enjoyed the opportunity to showcase their important work and enjoyed talking with him in this informal setting and agreed that seeing his genuine interest in their work was one of this year's highlights. All thought his visit was too short and hope that he will be able to stop again in the future.
