(S//REL) Letters To The Editor: Mission Assurance Facility Phase 2 Completed

(S//REL) The following was received about the article: Mission Assurance Facility Phase 2 Completed
(S//REL) The article dated 29 July 2004 entitled "Mission Assurance Facility Phase 2 Completed" needs a bit of clarification. That article was based upon an email I wrote to General Quirk, but was modified.
(S//REL) Unless you read the modified version carefully, a reader could come away with the impression that Phase 2 is completed. In point of fact, the $\square$ Phase 2 "facility" is completed, however Phase 2 in totality is not. None of the Phase 2 mission has yet been populated (although as stated some boxes have started to arrive).
(U) I really do appreciate the visibility that SIDtoday brings to the $\square$ mission and to the people who worked so hard to make this project a success. However, I do believe a correction is in order to avoid misunderstandings on the part of your readers.

Thanks,
(U) Point taken. ed.
