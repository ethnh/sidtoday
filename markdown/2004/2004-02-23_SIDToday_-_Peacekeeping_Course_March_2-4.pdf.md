(U//FOUO) What challenges does the 21st century hold for the institution of peacekeeping? Come to the NCS and find out!
(S) The SINIO Council, in conjunction with the National Cryptologic School, is pleased to present a course from the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies designed to examine the peacekeeping phenomenon -- from its inception in the early days of the UN through the Post-Cold War peacekeeping explosion, and to consider its future as one of the UN's most powerful instruments.
(S) This 3-day ( March 2-4 ) course on "Challenges of Peacekeeping in the 21st Century " will provide analysts with an opportunity to hear experts address the history and mechanics of peacekeeping, discuss the various types of peacekeeping operations (Chapter VI, Chapter VI and 1/2, Chapter VII), and look at the future: Will regional peacekeeping operations supplant UN operations? How does peacekeeping fit into U.S. national foreign policy? How will "donor fatigue" factor into considerations for new missions?
(S) Peacekeeping is an important issue touching upon the majority of UN member nations -which are either recipients of a peacekeeping mission or contributors (troops and/or funding) to such missions. Additionally, Support to the Warfighter includes Intelligence Needs associated with peacekeeping. This seminar therefore holds relevance for a wide range of Intelligence and Language Analysts across the SIGINT Directorate.
