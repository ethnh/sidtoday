(U//FOUO) Have you ever wondered how all of the SID acquisition and deployment efforts are coordinated? The SIGINT Systems Engineering Office (S01A) maintains a SID Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) for all of the developing and deployed systems to ensure that all these efforts work together to create music, not just noise.
(U) Major General Quirk, as the conductor of the SID orchestra, is responsible for selecting the music, setting the tempo, and cuing the various sections (S0, S1, S2, S31, S32, and S33) to play their parts. The SID IMS goal is to support him and other SID/ NSA leaders in:

- Monitoring the progress \& status of projects
- Controlling the impact of project schedule changes
- Supporting the integration of transformational PEO (Program Executive Office - DA4) projects
(U//FOUO) To accomplish this goal, SIGINT SEO tracks:
- System/Service Deliveries,
- Key Project Milestones,
- Inter-project Dependencies
for all of the SID system related projects/subprojects. In addition to producing a schedule for all these activities, we also track changes to the project schedules and analyze the schedule risk each quarter. (See the SID IMS Analysis Reports..)
(U//FOUO) These efforts have resulted in two major achievements for SID and one highly significant overarching achievement for NSA. For the first time, in the latest version of the SID IMS, all 51 "system related" projects provided schedules that were evaluated. Secondly, working with the SIGINT Lead Systems Engineers and IMS Points of Contact within the SID Organizations, none of the projects were assessed as high or "red" schedule risk. In addition to providing support to SID/NSA leaders, the SID IMS provided a significant input to the 31 March 2004 Congressional report on NSA systems that resulted in the release of $\$ 100 \mathrm{M}$ that Congress had withheld.
(U//FOUO) These achievements, and our continuing improvements to the SID IMS, reflect a strong SID commitment to the creation, use, and coordination of schedules. The SID IMS acts as the metronome that assures that the SIGINT orchestra plays well together and meets the NSA/CSS strategic goals of:
- Deliver Responsive Signals Intelligence and Information Assurance for National Security Under Any Circumstance
- Radically Improve the Production and Protection of Information
