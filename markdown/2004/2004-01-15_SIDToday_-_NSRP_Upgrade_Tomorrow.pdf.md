Information Needs (S111)
(U//FOUO) On 16 January 2004, the National SIGINT Requirements Process (NSRP) will be upgraded to incorporate the IC-wide National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) topics and priorities in accordance with National Security Council and DCI directives. NIPF replaces the old PDD-35-based Community Priority System (CPS) topics and priorities for all Active Standing and Limited Duration Information Needs (INs) and for all new INs. You can find out more about NIPF at the link listed below. A complete list of the changes to NSRP is at the end of this notification.
(U//FOUO) What does this mean for users of INs? Most INs will get new versions and new priorities. This will affect citations on reporting. New versions won't generate an error in SKYCAST, but the new priorities might. The NSRP team is helping analysts by preparing a web site where you can find out how your current key INs will change with the rollover. This site is linked to the NSRP secure tools site (see below for links). In addition, a new field in the Topic/Geopolitical/Priority table will provide the correct reporting citation to be used for that combination. You can copy and paste directly from the IN into your reporting tools. Lastly, the PLUS team will be closely monitoring citation errors during the rollover period and do everything they can to minimize unnecessary error messages by making what corrections they can. Error messages will be suspended for a brief period as we monitor the impact of these changes.
(U//FOUO) Changes to INs by the NIPF Transition on 16 January:

1. All Active and On-Hold Standing and Limited-Duration INs will get a new version number and most will get new national and SIGINT priorities.
2. All Active and On-Hold Standing and Limited-Duration INs will be converted to NIPF SubTopics
3. New TOPIC Identifiers will be displayed next to the topic/sub-topic names.
4. Research INs will NOT be updated; they will continue to reflect CPS Topics
5. All new INs will contain NIPF sub-topics
(U//FOUO) The development of this new version of NSRP has been focused on a successful NIPF implementation. Other than NIPF, only a few new features have been added. They include the ability to export INs into html format from the NPI client, showing the correct reporting citations in the IN, and more flexibility in the Basic Query Tool. A follow-on upgrade containing other improvements and any heretofore-undiscovered bug fixes will follow in February 2004.
