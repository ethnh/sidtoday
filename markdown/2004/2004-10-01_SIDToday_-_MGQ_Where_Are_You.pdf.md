Run Date: 10/01/2004
(U//FOUO) SIGINT Director MG Quirk will be TDY from 3-7 October. He will be joining the NSA Director in the UK for the Joint Management Review. The Joint Management Review (JMR) is an annual meeting of the NSA Seniors and the GCHQ** Board. This year the meeting will be held at GCHQ. (Last year the meeting was held in Key West, Florida.)
(U//FOUO) The meeting is an opportunity for NSA leaders and GCHQ's leaders to discuss the current strategies underlying the respective agency's operations. One of the most significant outcomes of these meetings has been the formal recognition that, as NSA moves ahead with its " Transformation 2.0 " and GCHQ with its "SIGINT Modernisation," we need to do so in step.
(U//FOUO) MG Quirk and his GCHQ counterpart, Mr. Iain Lobban, will discuss the progress of the implementation of Transformation 2.0 and GCHQ's counterpart SIGINT Modernisation program in their respective SIGINT Operations Directorates.
**(U) Notes:
GCHQ = Government Communications Headquarters, located in Cheltenham, England.
