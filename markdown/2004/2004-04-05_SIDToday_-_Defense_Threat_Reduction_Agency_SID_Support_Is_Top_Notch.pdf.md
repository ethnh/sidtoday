Account Manager for DTRA (S112)
(S) Have you ever wondered what U.S Government entity is responsible for detecting, defeating, characterizing, and preempting weapons of mass destruction? Who determines what kind of munitions you need to penetrate a given facility? How are underground facilities constructed, and how do you determine what they are used for? Who inspects chemical weapons storage facilities?
(U//FOUO) All these responsibilities belong to DTRA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. DTRA was created in October 1998 by consolidating several DoD elements: Defense Special Weapons Agency, Defense Technical Security Agency, and On-Site Inspection Agency. DTRA's mission is to "safeguard the United States and its friends from weapons of mass destruction by reducing the present threat and preparing for the future threat. DTRA's work covers a broad spectrum of activities - shaping the international environment to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), responding to military requirements to help the United States deter, withstand, prevail against and recover from the use of such weapons, and preparing the warfighter to counter the full spectrum of future WMD threats." (See their webpage on Intelink.)
(TS//SI) The SID Senior Executive Account Manager (SEAM), Joe Brand, and the Account Manager (AM), , continue to meet with the DTRA directorates and expose them to the value of SIGINT. Since 9/11 the SEAM/AM have worked closely with DTRA to ensure that NSA has received their Intelligence Needs and that we are responding to them with timely products and services. They have visited the Hard Target Research and Analysis Center, a collaborative effort between DTRA and the DCI's Underground Facilities Analysis Center; the Chemical/Biological Defense Directorate; and the Technology Development Directorate. They are facilitating analytic exchanges between DTRA and NSA analysts on lessons learned in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and regularly meet with DTRA's Security and Counterintelligence Directorate (SCI) to keep them apprised of developments in SIGINT dissemination, support, and activities.
(U//FOUO) DTRA has been so pleased with NSA's intelligence support that they asked the SID SEAM to brief the DTRA Threat Reduction Advisory Committee, which advises the DTRA Director, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and the Secretary of Defense. Our interaction with DTRA was hailed as the model of tailored intelligence support and one that DTRA would like to see all other intelligence agencies follow!
(S) Last February, the Account Manager briefed DTRA's monthly intelligence forum, comprised of intelligence analysts from each of the DTRA directorates, to engage these analysts in a more interactive role with NSA. Following this meeting, DTRA personnel approached the AM and asked to visit NSA to learn more about our capabilities. They also offered to brief NSA analysts on some development efforts in which they are engaged concerning threat anticipation, based on open source information, and initiatives under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
(U//FOUO) We are working to increase DTRA's interaction with NSA analysts. We encourage you to highlight areas in which DTRA assistance would be valuable. There's a wealth of knowledge waiting to be shared. If you see areas where interaction would be valuable, contact the AM for DTRA $\square$ ( $\square$ ( $\square$ ( $\square$ nsa) or the SEAM, $\square$ ( $\square$ ( $\square$ nsa).
