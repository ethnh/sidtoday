(U) New IPT: Horizontal Integration Capability Needs

FROM: Horizontal Integration IPT Executive Secretary Run Date: 03/01/2004

FROM: Horizontal Integration IPT Executive Secretary
(U//FOUO) The Horizontal Integration Capability Needs Integrated Product Team (IPT) has been established to understand our current capability, define the requirements for the future, and plot a path to get there. As the Director and Deputy Director have said, "It is not about the need to know, but rather the need to share." The intellectual capital of the "analytic community" here at NSA is as valuable as the SIGINT we produce, but its true value is only realized when it is shared. To facilitate sharing -- be it raw data, analytic knowledge, or finished SIGINT -- we must provide the necessary tools and policy framework.
(U//FOUO) The Horizontal Integration Capability Needs IPT will first gather the FY06 budget pieces, which will quantify our near-term capabilities. It will do this by mid-March. Next it will look to the future and how to get there. The IPT will develop operational scenarios that will put the ideas of integration and sharing up against potential real world events. These scenarios will have policy, legal, and cultural/people issues woven into them. Concurrent with the scenario development is the development of a Transformation 2.0 CONOP and integrated systems architecture.
(U//FOUO) Once they are completed, the IPT will use the CONOP, architecture, and mission scenarios to perform a functional needs analysis that will expose the gaps in our ability to collaborate and share. As we analyze our capabilities and needs, we will also work with internal and external developmental efforts already underway. The IPT will bound our current capabilities, define gaps in those capabilities, state the requirements to close our gaps, and quantify what we will need to get to our desired goal. These efforts are key pieces to getting to the next level of technological enablers to fulfill our "need to share." The team will finish the analysis necessary to define the "to be" state of Horizontal Integration by mid-July, incorporate vetted feedback, and submit a roll-out plan to the NSA Horizontal Integration Steering Group, chaired by Mr. Jim Allen, by late August.
