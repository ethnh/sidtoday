(U) One Login, Many Searches

FROM:
Target Development Services (S2S3)
Run Date: 08/11/2004
(U//FOUO) It seems that every month new tools are becoming available to allow SID analysts to search easily through piles of information for the "nuggets" they need. In fact, one such tool came on-line in June: the consolidated analytic metadata interface known as GLOBALREACH. Up until now, analysts wanting to run a query on various SIGINT Development metadata sets needed to log into each one separately. Now, GLOBALREACH allows them to login just once and search across all of the TAC / TDS data sets for their target of interest.
(S) Analysts can still have the option of accessing just a single database, but GLOBALREACH can save them the time and tedium of running the same query in multiple places. For example, if analysts want to know everything related to their target's phone number, INMARSAT TIN, GSM IMSI, or SMS address, all of this information can be gleaned with a single federated search. No more thinking about what tool to use for accessing data! Instead, they can focus on how their target is communicating regardless of mode.
(U) What data sets are available through GLOBALREACH?

- FASCIA, ASSOCIATION, DISHFIRE, YACHTSHOP, SPOTBEAM, BROOMSTICK, MAINWAY, ENTANGLER, GNDB, LAMPSHADE, OCTAVE, CONTRAOCTAVE and DISTANTFISH (coming soon)
(U) What tools are available through GLOBALREACH?
- BANYAN, DISHFIRE, YACHTSHOP, SPOTBEAM, ENTANGLER, GNDB and CONTRAOCTAVE
(S) Currently, GLOBALREACH allows searches on telephony metadata. Developers are also working on the near term solution to provide federated queries against DNI* metadata (e.g. email address) and plan to deliver this capability by September 2004 -- one part of the goal to bridge telephony and DNI analysis. Providing one-stop access to TDS ( Target Development Services, S2S3 ) tools is the first step in bringing these capabilities together. FASCIA and ASSOCIATION are working to integrate DNI metadata - imagine the possibilities! Access to other related tools and databases is also in our vision.
(S//SI) SIGDEV's TAC/TDS is a partner with Analysis \& Production on the A\&P Analytic Tools Strategy (APATS), a strategy to bridge analytic tools as a forerunner to RebA and TRAILBLAZER deliveries. TDS is also working with its sister division, the Metadata Analysis Center, to forge links with MAINWAY and the MAINWAY Entity Correlation database.
(S) For more information, see the GLOBALREACH webpage ("go globalreach"). Demos are available by contacting FASCIA and ASSOCIATION Feedback is welcome and can be sent to www.g12s.@nsa.
