(U//FOUO) From 11-14 May 2004, The Customer Gateway (S11) hosted the Worldwide Cryptologic Services Group (CSG) Conference 2004. The 3-Ã„1/2 day conference was the first since August 2001, and a priority for the Customer Account Management Division (S112) since assuming responsibility for CSG support from the Military Integration office back in October 2003 (see related article). The central theme of the conference was the impact of Transformation 2.0 on CSG operations.
(U//FOUO) The conference attendees represented more than 20 CSGs from around the country and around the world, to include Areas of Responsibility (AORs) such as CENTCOM, PACOM, SOCOM, NCEUR, FORSCOM, and STRATCOM, as well as the 2nd Party CSG, Australian Theatre.
(S//SI) Mr. Charlie Meals, Deputy SIGINT Director, kicked off the conference with an overview of Transformation 2.0/Extended Enterprise Governance. He highlighted how CSGs are making a difference every day and used as an example a story about a CSG'er forward-deployed to the Philippines to support US troops who were working with the Phillipine military. The CSG'er, along with analysts at KRSOC*, realized that there was a threat to a US commander, made the commander aware of the threat, and prevented the attack. Another example told how key SIGINT contributions made by CSG Key West assists drug busts made weekly.
(S//SI) Mr. Meals explained that of the petals atop the Transformation pyramid, CSGs belong to petals 3 and 4, Collaboration within the IC ${ }^{*}$, and Information sharing with clients/customers. NSA needs to know what clients/customers want. Case in point, during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) NSA collaborated bilaterally with customers and was heavily embedded in the decision making process, sharing significant amounts of information. He stressed that Transformation 2.0 is about maximizing SIGINT. To give the biggest bang for the buck, we have changed the way we do things.
(S//SI) NSA has traditionally always kept cards close to the vest. We now want to share relevant information with those who need to see it. Let clients decide where they need data from, not us deciding where they should come in, and then provide that data at the "Earliest Point of Consumability." Even bring Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from other agencies into our system who have expertise that we don't have, let them troll through SIGINT and find what we don't know is there.
(U//FOUO) Mr. Meal's presentation was followed by two days of individual CSG briefings from OCONUS*, CONUS, and local CSG chiefs and representatives. The CSG briefings addressed successes, challenges, and the impact of Transformation 2.0 on current operations and support to the customer. On days three and four, current NSAW initiatives and relevant familiarization training, tours, roundtables, and briefings were conducted. The recurring themes of the conference were manning and IT* challenges, to include personnel staffing and training, UNIX to NT migration, and telephony upgrades. The conference identified clear opportunities for increased collaboration, improved focus on the challenges, and the definitive steps for the way forward. The conference was a major success and opportunity to reinvigorate worldwide CSG support.
