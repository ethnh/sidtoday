(U//FOUO) On March 8th, MG Quirk signed a report that prioritizes sites for deployments of future SIGINT system capabilities. This Site Prioritization Report, put together by the SIGINT Integrated Product Team and coordinated and approved by the SID Executive Leadership Board (ELB) and external field elements, contains information that will be used as guidance for the deployment of transformational capabilities. The report is a dynamic document that will be updated on a periodic basis.
(U//FOUO) The report cannot be posted on NSAnet due to classification issues, but if you would like a copy, contact $\square$ at $\square$ nsa. He will email you a copy PKI-encrypted.
(U//FOUO) The Site Prioritization Report is a detailed, comprehensive report containing over 350 pages (those interested in the bottom line should refer to Section 3, Prioritization Results, pages 30-38). The report describes the processes the IPT used to develop the site lists along with "as is" and "to be" prioritized lists of sites. The report appendices provide additional information on the contributions of the sites along with integrated site lists based on the topics of terrorism and Trailblazer.
(S//SI) The report prioritizes sites within their respective access types, which were grouped into five broad categories that align with the SID budget structure:

- HF/Tactical
- Overhead
- FORNSAT
- SCS
- Cable/End Point


# (U) Background 

(U//FOUO) In July 2003 the SID ELB initiated a two-phase effort to conduct studies to provide SID leadership with information to make decisions related to transformation. The Phase I team produced a list of mission priorities based on the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF). The Phase II integrated product team (IPT) used the mission priorities output from Phase I and combined it with other available input (e.g. strategic plans, reporting statistics, deployment plans, etc.) to create a comprehensive report recommending the proposed prioritization of sites for deployment of future SIGINT system capabilities.
(U//FOUO) The Phase II effort began in August, and in just 60 days, the IPT researched, evaluated and synthesized information from numerous sources to create their recommendations. The IPT used information such as mission priorities, strategic plans, reporting statistics, and deployment plans, as well as site tasking and capabilities, site manning and skill mix, and dependencies between the sites. The team combined this disparate information into an extensive set of data, which they meticulously analyzed to form their final recommendations for the prioritized lists of sites.
(U//FOUO) At the completion of the study the IPT co-leads briefed the results to the SID ELB. The results were very favorably received and the team was directed to document the results in a report. Further, the ELB agreed with the IPT's recommendation to update the site prioritization on a regular basis and the Chief of S2 volunteered his organization to perform this task in the future.
(U//FOUO) The Site Prioritization IPT was co-led by (U//FOUO) from S01A and (U//FOUO) from S01R and had the following members:

- (Trailblazer)
- Kevan Barton (S01R)
- Frank Cawley (CNSG)
