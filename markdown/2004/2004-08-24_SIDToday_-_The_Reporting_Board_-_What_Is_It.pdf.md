(U) The Reporting Board - What Is It?

FROM: $\square$
The Reporting Board (S12A)
Run Date: 08/24/2004
(U) Frequently Asked Question: What's the Reporting Board? Who are they and what do they do?
(U//FOUO) If you went to our web page, you'd find that "The SID Reporting Board, as an advocate for SIGINT reporting, in conjunction with a robust reporters' network, identifies and communicates best practices in reporting with the goal of facilitating current reporting and evolving smoothly to e-SIGINT."
(U//FOUO) OK, what's that in plain English? What is an organization in Customer Response doing speaking for analysts in Analysis and Production?
... As that page says, we "team with other elements that have similar goals" -- Reporting Policy and Guidance, NSOC*, RSOCs*, the Intelligence Analysis Career Panel and Advisory Council, Futures Reporting, field representatives, production offices, the National Cryptologic School, the SIGINT Development office, and customers -- to identify and try to resolve overarching issues that affect reporting.
(U//FOUO) Who are we? Five long-time reporters -- military, ex-military, and civilian -- with experience in a variety of areas: language, field-site reporting, senior analysis/reporting from several Product Lines, policy dissemination, Information Assurance, and teaching (two of our number still teach reporting classes).
(U//FOUO) "Why haven't I heard of the RB before?" Well, much of our work is done through liaison with other entities, and many of our achievements are publicized by other organizations. We often work behind the scenes to influence issues that affect reporters, and the result may be the addition of a button on a reporting tool, or a field that no longer has to be manually filled in. A recent unpublicized accomplishment was the identification of INformation Technology (IT) issues as a source of much user dissatisfaction with reporting tools. This came about as a result of the Board's participation in the Report Requirements Board under the JOURNEYMAN program. The RRB will analyze user comments on proposed upgrades to take these issues into account and see that they are directed to IT to resolve.
(U//FOUO) "How Can I Give the RB My Ideas and Views?" The Virtual Reporting Board, an e-mail alias of volunteers (mainly senior reporters in A\&P and in the field), brings a valuable breadth and depth to the discussion of reporting issues. If you want to bring something up, or participate in these discussions, e-mail @nsa or dl virtualrb.
(U//FOUO) Watch for more information in tomorrow's SIDtoday: What the Reporting Board Can Do for You .
