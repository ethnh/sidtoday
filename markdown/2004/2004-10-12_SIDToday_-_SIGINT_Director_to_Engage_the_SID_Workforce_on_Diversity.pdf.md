(U//FOUO) SIGINT Director to Engage the SID Workforce on Diversity

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director
Run Date: 10/12/2004
(U//FOUO) Beginning 20 October, I will be meeting with SID personnel on the subject of Diversity. At the initial session on that date, I would like to share with those interested in minority issues what I have learned in recent months and the initial steps I have decided to take to address some areas of concern. I welcome you to join me in my commitment to a program of fairness and inclusion for SID's future. I am convinced that we must be an employer of choice for diverse and talented employees if we are to succeed in coming years.
(U//FOUO) After the general session on issues related to all minorities, I intend to have separate sessions to focus on concerns for specific segments of SID's minority workforce. Those smaller sessions will lend themselves to interaction and discussion along the lines of what some of you are familiar with in SID's "What's on Your Mind" sessions.
(U//FOUO) Later, I hope to have the opportunity to engage the workforce further - in even smaller groups. I appreciate your support as we continue to expand our transformation into the people aspect of our business.
