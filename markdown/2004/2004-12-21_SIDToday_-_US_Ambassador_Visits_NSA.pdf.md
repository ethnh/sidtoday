(U) U.S. Ambassador Visits NSA
FROM:
Deputy SINIO for East Asia (S17)
Run Date: 12/21/2004
(C) The new US Ambassador to Thailand, Ralph "Skip" Boyce, made his first directorate-level visit to NSA on 8 December. Mr. Boyce, a career member of the Senior Foreign Service, has extensive experience in Asia, most recently as Deputy Assistant Secretary East Asia and Pacific Affairs. He served as the Ambassador to Indonesia from 2001 to 2004, a political officer in Bangkok, the Deputy Chief of Mission in Bangkok, and as a Charge d'Affaires in Singapore. Ambassador Boyce met the Director, the Foreign Affairs Directorate, and SCS personnel, and attending a SINIO-sponsored roundtable with NSA targets experts to discuss current and emerging intelligence issues and NSA support.
(C) Ambassador Boyce, already a fan of SIGINT from his previous postings, explained what type of SIGINT was most useful to him while the analysts talked about the latest in access and target developments. Overall, Ambassador Boyce's visit to NSA was fruitful both for him and for the NSA workforce. We expect to continue our close working relationship with Thailand with Ambassador Boyce's full support.
