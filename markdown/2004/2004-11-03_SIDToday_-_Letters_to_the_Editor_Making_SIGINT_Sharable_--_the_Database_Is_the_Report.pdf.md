Comment: (S//SI) I just finished reading the SID Today article on Database Sharing and to say that I was appalled is putting it mildly. I am well aware that for years the users of our reports have yelled to know how we know what we know or feel they need the "raw" info to better understand what our reports say, but to indicate that by doing this it allows our customers to analyze and manipulate the data to come to their own conclusions ... that's what we're supposed to be doing! And to say that by allowing access to our databases so "analysts won't have to write reports or respond to RFIs, thereby giving them more time" -- time to do what!, it sure as heck isn't going to be writing reports!!! Since the mid '90s the so called IC has been nibbling around NSA, trying to get more and more of our mission, of our charter into their domains -- with this extremely ill advised decision, not only have they accomplished that, they no longer need to nibble -- now they just get the plate and the fork and get to dine at will.

Comment: (U//FOUO) Thank you for your recent article on information sharing. Most of the Unified Commands have been advocating this for years and it is gratifying to finally see public support for this concept from within NSA. We understand how tough it will be to change the thinking of many and applaud your work in this area. The folks who made ROADBED externally accessible related their struggle to us, and we understand the resistance to change that must be overcome. In the end, the efforts of people like [the author] will make SIGINT far more efficient and effective. We applaud your work. Thank you.
