(U//FOUO) The SID staff convened on April 13th in the Friedman Auditorium for a town meeting to discuss a realignment of staff functions. SID Chief of Staff Charles Berlin informed the group that input from the staff workforce had been received and incorporated into the final plan, and SID was ready to proceed with a reassignment of responsibilities.
(U//FOUO) According to Mr. Berlin, the three "drivers" of the change were 1) the new Extended Enterprise governance initiative, 2) the move towards better staff integration, and 3) an independent assessment of the staff structure that had recommended changes.
(U//FOUO) So, what's going to change?

1) A new Operations Staff will take shape in S02 (under the renamed Deputy for Operations and Support). It will provide:

- planning support to the IMTs (Issue Management Teams),
- Extended Enterprise support * (formerly performed in the Extended Enterprise Management office, S01X1), except for the TSPMO** function.
- leadership support for issues, briefings and actions (previously performed by the Leadership Support Team)
- Operation SIGINT coordination

2) All requirements functions will be consolidated in Support Requirements (S01R). This will include Reserve Mission Management and Workforce Planning and Investment (both moved from the People Office, S01P).
3) A SID-RAD Bridge will stand up, under the auspices of the Chief Technical Officer (CTO). The Bridge will ensure that RAD (Research Associate Directorate) and SID coordinate closely so that RAD can provide the technology solutions that SID needs.
4) A Future Concept Developments function will be created.
5) The Programming and Performance functions (currently S01X3 and S01X4) will be integrated.
6) Some functions being carried out by SID staff will be taken up by NSA corporate-level elements, as follows:

- workforce advocacy functions transferred from the People Office (S01P) to Human Resources (MD)
- the Process Asset Library will move from Project Management and Baseline Planning (S01X5) to the Unified Cryptologic Architecture Office (DE)
- the Project Management Training mission goes from S01X5 to the National Cryptologic School
- Project Baseline will move from S01X5 to a corporate element (to be determined).
(U//FOUO) Some details are yet to be worked out, including leadership assignments, but the realignment will take place effective 19 April. The briefing slides from the meeting - including a revised wiring diagram - are now available.
(U//FOUO) Notes:
*Some Extended Enterprise personnel will be forward-deployed to S1, S2 and S3.
**TSPMO = Technical Support Program Management Office
