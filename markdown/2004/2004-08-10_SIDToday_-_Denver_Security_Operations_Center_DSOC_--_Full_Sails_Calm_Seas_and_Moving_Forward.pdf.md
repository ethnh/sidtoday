(U) Denver Security Operations Center (DSOC) -- Full Sails, Calm Seas, and Moving Forward

FROM:
Deputy Chief, DSOC PMO
Run Date: 08/10/2004
(S) A lot has happened since the "Status of the DSOC" article appeared in March. Through the herculean efforts of a dedicated group of professionals both in the Washington D.C. area and in Denver, four key documents were created to act as a foundation for how the DSOC will operate, and how it will govern the extended Technical SIGINT enterprise and work with its partners in Denver. In April a manpower review team validated 445 positions in the DSOC. Most of the key leadership positions have been filled. In fact, DSOC's first Director, Mr. John Canavan, is taking his place this month.
(S//SI) Four missions supported by 90 personnel have already been transferred to the DSOC:

- The Fusion Reporting and Analysis Branch (FRAB) is producing serialized SIGINT products resulting from the analysis of multi-intelligence, multi-source data related to Technical SIGINT targets.
- The National Air Navigation Team (NANT) supports the exploitation of a group of aircraft navigation signals.
- The ELINT Unidentified Signals (EUI) performs analysis of unidentified radar signals collected worldwide to determine platform, function, operating mode and user.
- The Maritime Analysis Support Team (MAST) tracks high interest shipping across the globe.

The DSOC workforce is expected to grow to approximately 120 personnel by the start of CY 2005. Also, construction will soon begin on temporary modular facilities to support the DSOC's growing workforce.
(S) There is still a great deal of work ahead. The layout of a permanent building for the DSOC is underway. Information Technology Infrastructure Services (ITIS) is aggressively developing a robust computer and communications network to support the DSOC. Invitations to integrate into the DSOC have gone out to our mission partners both here and abroad. GCHQ has already made a commitment to send integrees. DIA's Missile and Space Intelligence Center (MSIC) and the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) are both committed to sending personnel to work in the DSOC. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is already embedded in the DSOC and looking to expand its support.
(S) The Director's vision of creating a Technical SIGINT Center of Excellence in Denver to manage the Global Enterprise is well on its way to becoming a reality.
