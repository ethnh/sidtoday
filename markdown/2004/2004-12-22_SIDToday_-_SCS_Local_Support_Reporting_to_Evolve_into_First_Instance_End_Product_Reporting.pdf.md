(U//FOUO) SCS Local Support Reporting to Evolve into 'First Instance' End Product Reporting

FROM:
Reporting Policy and Guidance (S1212)
Run Date: 12/22/2004

New vehicle will get intel to broader customer set quickly; not automatically ORCON (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) With DIRNSA's blessing and in keeping with transformational efforts to make SIGINT more user-friendly and available to customers as soon in the process as feasible, F6* will be phasing out Local Support Reports (LSRs) and rolling out the " First Instance Reporting " initiative. First Instance Reporting (FIR) refers to SIGINT end product reporting which normally focuses on targets, issues and personalities of specific interest to local SIGINT customers, but may include information addressing national level priorities.
(U//FOUO) This reporting is derived from field collection facilities with limited or no access to national level analytic databases and sources; therefore, it may include only part of the story. Users of this information should strive to match this information with other sources and as with all reporting, stay vigilant for additional NSA/Extended Enterprise reporting.
(S) LSRs -- produced by SCS sites worldwide-- historically were disseminated to a very limited customer set and could not be used by customers in briefings, summaries, assessments, etc, until the NSAW TOPI** had evaluated the information fully and issued that information in an NSAW end-product report.
(S) First Instance Reporting allows all customers interested in and cleared for SIGINT on a given topic to receive the information produced by the field sites without waiting for NSAW to evaluate and reissue that information in an end product. The intitiative also allows customers to request post-publication services (ORCON*** release, foreign release, identity release) related to the first instance reporting. SCS sites currently producing LSRs will transition to FIRs between now and the end of January 2005. FIRs will include a caveat underscoring the fact that NSAW has not verified the information.
(U//FOUO) This initiative will replace Local Support Reports with which some customers are familiar and is intended to make the SIGINT produced by the field collection facilities more accessible to a broader audience and easier for customers to use:

- FIRs will generally be disseminated to any customer that has a need and is cleared for the information in the report.
- Unlike Local Support Reports, which universally carried an ORCON handling caveat, FIRs will be ORCON only when the sensitivity of the content requires that handling.
- Customers may use any non-ORCON information immediately in summaries, assessments, etc. without waiting for NSA HQ to review and reissue the information in another format. As a reminder, this information is derived from field collection facilities with limited or no access to national level analytic databases and sources; therefore, it may include only part of the story.
- In addition, as with all SIGINT end-product reports, customers may request approval from S121's SIGINT Post-Publication Services Branch for ORCON release, Foreign Release, or US identity release based on an FIR. This was not possible with Local Support Reports.
(U//FOUO) Much like other basic end product, FIRs will often be the first serialized report on an issue, event or activity, and may be the only reporting on the issue, event or activity. There is one key difference. FIRs are produced by field collection facilities with limited or no access to
national level analytic databases. They will generally focus on issues of immediate, specific interest to local SIGINT customers. For these reasons, FIRs will carry the following caveat to remind customers that the information has not been fully analyzed or verified by NSA HQ:

TEXT: WARNING NOTICE: THIS IS A FIRST INSTANCE REPORT WHICH CONTAINS INFORMATION NOT VERIFIED BY NSA.
(S) Close coordination between F6 and S2 will ensure that SCS sites conform to specific reporting needs of each product line.
(U//FOUO) Please contact S121's Reporting Policy Branch @nsa or @nsofif you have any questions.
