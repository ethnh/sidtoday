(S//SI) The Network Analysis Center

(TS//SI) In the last DA Note to the Workforce, we talked about recent and on-going activities designed to connect efforts in our line organizations and around the extended enterprise. Today we focus on the Network Analysis Center (NAC), one of three key SIGINT development centers, providing analysis of our most challenging target networks.
(TS//SI) The NAC consists of a skilled cadre of Collection Managers, Computer Scientists, Engineers, Intelligence Analysts, Network Engineers and Mathematicians all performing Network Analysis in order to isolate and obtain access to a myriad of targets within the worldwide digital network. Network Analysis performed by the division is conducted using a variety of data sources, to include open source data, routing protocol data as well as other forms of SIGINT data in order to achieve this goal. As the worldwide network has exploded into the choice form of communication for many targets, NAC is called upon from various elements within both the Analysis and Production and Data Acquisition Directorates in order to assist with both tactical and strategic Network Analysis needs.
(TS//SI) The result of NAC's work can be seen through the variety of different tasks we perform. For example, NAC played an instrumental part during the January 2004 apprehension of key Al Qaida operatives within Iraq - namely Husam al-Yemeni, aka Firas -- and the 30 May capture of Umar Baziyani. We've assisted the Office of Regional Targets with developing a more complete understanding infrastructure. We've also assisted this same office with the development of an important digital network associated with Venezuela's leader, Victor Chavez. We regularly assist the Office of Counterterrorism with the daily tracking of several key targets as they move throughout the worldwide digital network.
(TS//SI) As well as dealing with current Network Analysis needs, NAC looks to the future needs of the Directorate and ways we can assist in a proactive manner versus a reactionary mode. A few examples of this can be witnessed through anticipatory development efforts we completed in preparation for the 2004 Olympics. We're also spearheading efforts to apply Network Analysis techniques to the analysis of special source data in support of current counter-terrorism needs as well as future needs of operationas against the AQSL (al-Qa'ida Senior Leadership).
(TS//SI) And if all this isn't impressive enough, NAC also realizes the importance of not only tracking targets within the worldwide web, but also keeping abreast of the current network technologies used by those targets. To that end, NAC currently holds chairmanship of both the Agency's Virtual Private Network (VPN), and Wireless DNI working groups. Additionally, our Routing Protocols Working Group is working to define smart ways to infuse routing/routed protocol analysis into our mainstream Network Analysis methods.
