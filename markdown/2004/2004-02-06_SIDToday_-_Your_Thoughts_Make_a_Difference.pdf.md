(U//FOUO) In 2003, the SIGINT People Office established a Workforce Advocacy team to assist SID's transformation by listening to the views of the workforce, recommending process improvements, and facilitating change.
(U//FOUO) The team recently published SID's first Workforce Advocacy Report that represents feedback not only from the general population, but also from several diverse groups to include: new hires, military, shiftworkers, field, and 15+ years of service. The report contains several issues faced by the SID workforce, the corrective actions taken in FY03, and the workforce's proposed recommendations for FY04.
(U//FOUO) Four major themes emerged from the analysis of the data:

1. Communications
2. Knowledge sharing
3. Assimilation, and
4. Leadership accountability.
(U) As the SIGINT Director, I support all the recommendations for future efforts.
(U//FOUO) I applaud the collaboration demonstrated by all those mentioned in the report: ADHRS, ADET, ADIL, Corporate, SID Planning team, Chiefs of Staff, and all the enabling partners to support SID's efforts to continue our transformation.
(U//FOUO) I encourage you to provide your feedback, ideas, and suggestions for further improvements to the team at @nsa.
