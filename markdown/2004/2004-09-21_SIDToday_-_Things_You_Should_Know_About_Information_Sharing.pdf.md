(U) Things You Should Know About Information Sharing

(U) If the SIGINT system were a private company, what would it sell? Historically, our "product" has been SIGINT reporting. But, crucial as this reporting is, in recent years it has become clear that we have other "goods" of equal value to offer our customers -- things that have sometimes been locked away inside our walls and fences. What kinds of things? -- our knowledge, our insight, our data, and our accesses, to name a few. Now, the Agency and the larger Intelligence Community have recognized the need to get every type of valuable information -- from whatever source -- to those who can use it. The drive to make this happen is known as "information sharing."
(U) Information sharing is one of the most important challenges we face as an Agency. Analysis \& Production (A\&P), with the help of our Policy counterparts, has spent the past year making substantive changes to policies and processes that stand in the way of partnering and collaboration. At the same time, the Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD) has pioneered other aspects of information sharing, specifically in implementing the "swimming upstream" concept and new reporting and dissemination methods. Now the time has come to move from pilot programs impacting only a few, to institutional changes that will affect all SIGINT analysts.
(U) The key to collaboration and partnering is to share intellectual capital. The Director has provided the vision in his Transformation 2.0 initiative, and now additional guidance and policy have been put into place to support that vision. The building blocks for information sharing are laid. Now is the time for analysts to seek out close collaborative relationships -- with counterparts wherever they may be -- that will help improve the country's security.
(U) Where can you find information on these changes in policies and processes? -- the Information Sharing Webpage . To access it, just type "go infoshare." There you will learn about:

- ways we've enabled SIGINTers to collaborate with Intelligence Community partners;
- how it's now easier to form partnerships both within and outside the Agency; and
- how the new "dual authorities" concept will allow analysts to more readily form analytic partnership cells.
(U) If you are a SIGINT analyst or manager, please take some time to review this important information. If you have questions, please contact @nsa, @nsa, @nsa, @nsa@nsa@. at @nsa@nsa, @nsa@nsa@.
