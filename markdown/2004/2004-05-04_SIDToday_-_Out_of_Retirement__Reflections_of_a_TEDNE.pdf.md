(U) As I handed my badge to the very courteous British guard at the main gate of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, England on 31 December 1997, I knew that once I left the compound it would mark the end of a wonderful 28-year career with the National Security Agency. My husband had come to GCHQ for a 3-year posting, and I had accompanied him, working as an integree for several months. This was a fabulous experience that I will always recall with great fondness. Therefore, the decision to take advantage of the Agency's early retirement scheme was not made easily.
(U) Nonetheless, having made the decision, I proceeded as planned. Leaving the GCHQ compound, I reflected happily on many years of exciting, rewarding job assignments, unique opportunities afforded to me through my Agency employment, and all the wonderful friends that my husband and I had made over the years. So, it was with a feeling of happiness and contentment that I began to settle into a life of genteel retirement, in the lovely spa town of Cheltenham surrounded by the beautiful Cotswold hills.
(U) My husband and I returned to our home in Maryland in August, 2000. Shortly after our return, my husband also retired from the Agency. In July, 2001, we celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary and both delighted in living life on our own schedule. Who would have known that the lives of all Americans would change so dramatically less than two months later.
(U) As I watched with horror the TV coverage of the terrorist attacks against innocent civilians in America on September 11, 2001, my immediate reaction, like most Americans, was, "What can I do to help?" Therefore, when I received a phone call from the Agency asking if I would consider returning to work, the answer was immediate and it was positive. Without hesitation, I decided to take a leave of absence from retirement.
(U//FOUO) During the course of my Agency career, I served in a variety of analytic, staff and management assignments and was a Senior Group Coordinator in NSOC during Operation Desert Storm. Returning to work in early 2002 as a Temporary Employee During the National Emergency (TEDNE), formerly the Civilian Cryptologic Reserve Program - CCRP, has allowed me to return to my analytic roots.
(S) In my present assignment as a Senior Intelligence Analyst, I research, write, coordinate, and release Summary Reports on a wide range of issues related to the Global War on Terrorism, the Iraq and Afghan Campaigns, Proliferation of WMD, and issues related to Homeland Security. The work, as always, is tremendously interesting and vitally important. Positive feedback from customers on the Summary Reports also reinforces my sense of contributing to the Agency's critical mission.
(U) My fellow analysts, reporters and managers have all been very supportive, and I thank them for making the adjustment from retirement to work an easy one. I feel tremendously privileged to have been able to return to assist the Agency during this time of national crisis, and I'm very grateful that I can apply the target knowledge and experience that I gained over the years with NSA to today's challenges.
(U) At my retirement party in England, I shared with the "younger" generation of intelligence analysts that working for the National Security Agency and being associated with the Intelligence Community was not just a job, but an adventure. Working as a TEDNE allows the adventure to continue.
