(U//FOUO) The Intelligence Analysis and Language Analysis Skill Communities are launching the Intelligence Analysis Strategic Stronghold, a virtual team of SIGINT analysts who will ensure mission readiness by providing short-term analytic support to crisis missions across Analysis \& Production.
(U//FOUO) Intelligence Analysis Strategic Stronghold (IA/SS) members will be called to work crisis areas, lending their keenly developed analytic skills to work the nation's highest priority missions for short amounts of time, returning to their pre-crisis work within 30 days. In many instances, IA/SS members will be able to work the crisis missions from their own workspaces. Analysis and Production/Deployment Services will provide IA/SS members with the training they will need to move to crises across the Directorate. The training will include analytic tools and techniques as well as target experience. There will be initial training to get members "up to speed" and subsequent training as circumstances require.
(U//FOUO) These attributes are key for IA/SS membership:

- a working knowledge of reporting tools, policy, and legal guidelines,
- impeccable writing skills (minimal or no editing required),
- proven adaptability and flexibility,
- experience in more than one IA discipline (ex., military, diplomatic, call chaining),
- report release authority is a plus, but not required; and
- a willingness to take on new targets in a fast "Ops tempo".
(U//FOUO) Learn more about the IA Strategic Stronghold during the IA Town Meeting today at 0900-1100.
