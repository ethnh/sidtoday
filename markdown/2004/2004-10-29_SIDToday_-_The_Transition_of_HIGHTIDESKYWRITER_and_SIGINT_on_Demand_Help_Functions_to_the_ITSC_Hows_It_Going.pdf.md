(U//FOUO) The Transition of HIGHTIDE/SKYWRITER and SIGINT on Demand Help Functions to the ITSC: How's It Going?

FROM:
Chief, Reporting Tools Branch (S1221)
Run Date: 10/29/2004

Transition of "help desk" support from S1221 to the IT Support Center goes pretty smoothly; tips on how best to get the help you need (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) The SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE and SIGINT On Demand (SOD) first-tier "Help Desk" transferred its functions from the Customer Response Reporting Tools Branch to ITSC ('Remedy') on 24 May 2004 -- with virtually no degradation or interruption of services and little outward indication of turmoil! Well, almost....
(U//FOUO) Notwithstanding the detailed planning and training that preceded the transfer, there was the usual outbreak of frayed nerves and user anxiety that seems to accompany organizational change of any kind. For the most part, however, analysts and reporters continued to receive rapid, effective solutions to their problems during the transition period. Actually, service has improved steadily over the past six months as our ITI* first-responders have gained experience in handling and routing requests for help. Nevertheless, the Reporting Tools Branch and ITSC continue to monitor the process and have a few suggestions we hope will greatly improve your customer service experience.
(U//FOUO) ITSC continues to receive a high volume of help requests dealing with SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE and SOD user accounts and group permissions. One way that analysts can help reduce the number of these requests is to take advantage of the many experienced users who abound throughout the analytical groups. Often, just by asking a colleague, an analyst can get the answer to questions without initiating a formal ticket and the tracking activity that often ensues.
(U//FOUO) Almost as important as the expert users who can help in a pinch are the numerous working aids and references that are available. For help using SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE, there are links to numerous aids on the SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE homepage ("go skywriter" or "go hightide"); these include the system users manual and the SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE/SKYCAST working aid. For SOD, the homepage ("go sigint on demand" or "go sod") also has links to an excellent on-line users guide and new workings aids for the autosource and multimedia functions. In addition to these formal documents, there are "home grown" working aids available in most of the analytical offices. Get to know who has or maintains them and what they can do for you.
(U//FOUO) Lastly, getting requests to the right office will often expedite resolution of most problems. The most common help requests not related to SKYWRITER/HIGHTIDE and SOD, involve metrics, policy, or storage and retrieval. The following offices are well equipped to respond to requests for information on these topics:

- Metrics:


# - Reporting Policy: 

- Storage/Retrieval of Product Reports:


## (U//FOUO) But remember, SERVICE is the mission of ITSC and the Reporting Tools Branch. If you can't get local help in solving your problem quickly, if the available references and working aids don't seem to help, or if you simply don't have the time to bother with these and need help fast, by all means, and the need to be used to make sure that you need to be used, or submit a trouble ticket via the Information Technology Support Center web site ("go itsc"). The ITSC will either provide a response or route your request to an office or person who can.
