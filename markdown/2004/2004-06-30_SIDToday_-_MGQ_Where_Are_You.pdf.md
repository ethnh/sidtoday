(U//FOUO) Signals Intelligence Director MG Quirk is checking out the land down under! On June 24 and 25 he attended the Five-Eyes SIGINT Directors Meeting in Australia...
(C) From June 27 to 29, he was participating in the FLINDERS Conference, an annual Five-Eyes SIGINT-HUMINT heads of agency meeting aimed at increasing collaboration between the SIGINT and HUMINT communities. (The name changes every year -- last year it was called PALLISER.)
(U//FOUO) After the conference, MG Quirk will talk with his Australian and New Zealander counterparts at the respective bilateral meetings: from June 30-July 2 he will attend the Australia bilateral meeting and finally on July 6 and 7, he will attend the New Zealand bilateral meeting. MG Quirk will return to Fort Meade on 12 July, perhaps with a new pet koala!
