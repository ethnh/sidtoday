(U) Desktop Modernization is Coming to a Desk Near You!

(U//FOUO) So, what exactly does desktop modernization mean to you and how do you find out when it is going to happen? We are here to give you the answers you are seeking. The complete modernization of your desktop includes a lot more then you are probably aware. Not only is a Windows workstation coming to your desk (with Microsoft office automation tools), but all of your email and personal files will be transferred, operating system and JAVA upgrades will be completed, and the network to your new desktop computer will be modernized.
(U//FOUO) That sounds like a lot, but there is still more! For example, if you use ICARUS, you transition to PKI. Display-back services for some UNIX legacy applications are set up. If you are a linguist or reporter, you have even more transitions to anticipate. These lucky folks are transitioning to the new suite of voice tools, new dictionaries and a new working aid system. And most people will have to make some adjustments to their existing work processes to take full advantage of the new tools. Wow! It is a lot to get through, but we are here to help you navigate through the changes.
(U//FOUO) So, when is all of this going to happen for you? S2L, S2B and S2D are already in the process, and S2H, S2A and S2K will be modernized over the summer. Next on the list are S2C and S2F, with all the others (S2E, S2I, S2J, S2G, S2S, S31) coming behind (most of S1 already has Windows workstations).
