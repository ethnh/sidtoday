(U//FOUO) You may not have seen this in the newspapers, but it's a fact nonetheless: the protoSID today page first appeared a year ago today. It was called the "SID Message of the Day", and was designed as a way for SID management to communicate regularly with the workforce. (You may want to take a look at the first edition, for old time's sake.)
(U//FOUO) Things have changed a lot in 12 months! The MOTD became SID today on March 31st, switching from a management message to a "SID newspaper" format. Instead of a topdown comms path, we are now communicating top-down, bottom-up, and laterally across the workforce. If SID today were an antenna, it would be omnidirectional!
(U//FOUO) The SID leadership has encouraged this development as a way of sharing information throughout the Directorate. Our intent is to allow people to voice their opinions freely, even if those views may be a little controversial at times. There are some constraints, of course, on what we can publish. We can't get into political debates, or give a plug for a commercial product, or post something that is antithetical to what SID stands for. But beyond that, people are free (and encouraged) to voice their ideas.
(U//FOUO) We have a "Submit an article idea" button... please make use of it! Also, we would like to hear your views of SID today ... let us know what you think of it!
