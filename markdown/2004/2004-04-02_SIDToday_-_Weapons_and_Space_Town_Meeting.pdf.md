(S//SI) On March 23, SIGINT Director MG Quirk and BG Armor of NRO's SIGINT Programs hosted a town meeting for the S2J (Weapons \& Space) workforce. The meeting followed a similar town meeting held earlier in the month for the Denver Security Operations Center (DSOC) workforce. The gathering focused on the ongoing process of transferring the TechSIGINT "center of gravity" from Ft Meade to Denver.
(S//SI) Generals Quirk and Armor described the strategy behind the move (see the article " Status of the DSOC " for details), and also addressed some of the logistical and administrative issues of interest to the workforce. Members of the Denver Integrated Product Team (IPT), tasked with ensuring a smooth transition of the mission to Denver, also provided an update on the many agreements, concept of operations, schedules, etc. currently being finalized. According to IPT member Morrie Levine, all of the major documentation will be completed by April 5th for presentation to Congress.
(S//SI) The presenters noted that although most of the TechSIGINT workforce will transition to Denver in the coming years, a sizable presence (such as DEFSMAC and those working budgetary matters, for example) will remain at Ft Meade. MG Quirk encouraged the workforce to challenge their management to resolve any issues as they arise. Slides from the town meeting are available for viewing.
