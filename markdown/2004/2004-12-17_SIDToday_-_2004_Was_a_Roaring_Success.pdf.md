(U) 2004 Was a Roaring Success

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA, and Charlie Meals Signals Intelligence Director and Deputy Director Run Date: 12/17/2004

SID leaders encourage work force to take a break during the holidays (U)
(U) As the end of the year draws near, we would like to thank all of the men and women who are part of the U.S. SIGINT System -- SID, the Global Enterprise, our military/tactical SIGINT force, and our indispensable "enablers" -- for your unprecedented team efforts in providing key intelligence that our customers have put to such good use. Our nation depends on our products and services, today more than ever. In 2004, you delivered, rising to incredible challenges with tremendous skill and dedication. It has taken each and every one of you, dedicating your expertise and energy to the task and willingly supporting those on your left and right, to bring about this success.
(U//FOUO) Meanwhile, throughout this demanding year, we have continued to transform ourselves into a 21st century, network-centric enterprise. This enterprise enables unprecedented collaboration and allows each of us more freedom in the execution of our duties. There's no question, we have a long way to go -- but it is notable that we've made such progress while simultaneously producing SIGINT of such great quantity and quality.
(U) Now is the time of year we celebrate our national and religious holidays, and it is important that we do just that. Many of us, knowing the importance of our mission, are reluctant to take time away from work, but we must take some time to reflect on all of the benefits we enjoy as Americans. We have an extraordinary organization with great depth -- no one is indispensable. Take a pause from manning the "gun emplacements" to spend time with family or friends. This is an opportunity for you to rejuvenate, give thanks, and prepare for a busy year ahead -- it is important to us that you do so.
(U) Next year, the war will continue and our challenges will increase, as will our opportunities. Meanwhile, we'll continue down the transformational road as we build a more effective organization that will also be a more rewarding place to work. Some will look at these challenges as daunting, but this test is what brings us back every year. So that we may give it our best next year, take a break this year. Very best wishes to you and your families this holiday season and thank you again for helping to make the nation a safer place.
