(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: You may remember an article we ran a while back in which
discussed working as a second-generation NSA'er. Today we have another story (anonymous) of how intelligence can be a "family business."
(U//FOUO) I have a brother who is over ten years older than me, and ever since I was old enough to remember where he worked, I knew he worked for the State Department. When it came time for me to apply for a job, I went to an information session about NSA. it sounded cool, so I applied.
(U//FOUO) When I flew out for my polygraph, I got my first hint of the "family secret." The polygrapher asked if I had any close relatives who worked for the Agency, and I said "no". She then asked about my brother, by name. Confused, I said, "No, he works for the State Dept." That won me a condescending nod and ended the discussion.
(U//FOUO) This incident made sense to me some time later, after I had been working at the Agency for a while. I received an email from an NSA employee whose name looked familiar... it was my brother! Little did I suspect when I joined NSA that for many years I'd had family connections at the Agency!
(U) If you have an interesting story, we'd like to hear it! Please contact us. Thanks.
