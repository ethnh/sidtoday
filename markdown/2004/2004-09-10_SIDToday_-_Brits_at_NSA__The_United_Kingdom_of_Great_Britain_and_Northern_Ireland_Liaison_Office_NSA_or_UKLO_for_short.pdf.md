(U//FOUO) Brits at NSA: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Liaison Office, NSA (or UKLO for short)

FROM: Alex Dewdney
UKLO
Run Date: 09/10/2004
(C) GCHQ, the UK's Sigint agency, is represented at NSA by the UK Liaison Office in Ops 2B, and some 40 military and civilian integrees scattered throughout the organisation. Orange picture passes and cars with peculiar number plates are therefore a common sight at Fort Meade - but what do all these Brits do, and how long have we been here?
(C) With the first UK Siginter posted to the US in 1941, the UK-US integree programme actually pre-dates UKUSA (the 1946 agreement that cemented the relationship between the Sigint services of the US, UK and Canada; Australia and New Zealand joining the 2nd Party club soon afterwards). At the heart of the early relationship was collaboration on cryptanalysis: this is still the case today, but UK integrees have for a long time also been embedded in Analysis and Production - where, for example, we are establishing two news posts in the Office of CounterTerrorism; Data Acquisition; and in a wide range of technical roles.
(C) The UK Liaison Team (UKLT) goes back almost as far, its history stretching from a Col H M O'Connor, posted to Washington DC in 1943 to represent the British Government Tools and Cipher School, to the present day GCHQ Senior UK Liaison Officer (SUKLO), who splits her time between DC and Fort Meade. Besides , there are currently 10 other liaison officers covering the full range of cryptologic business:

(U/FOUO) We also have a support team, and an office at the British Embassy in DC.
(C) These days the UKLT is busier than ever. This year alone we expect to have nearly 2000 UK visitors to NSA, mostly from GCHQ but also from other UK organisations such as the Secret Intelligence Service, the Security Service (MI5), the Ministry of Defense and the UK Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC - the equivalent of US TTIC). We work closely with the Foreign Affairs Directorate to make sure that visit programmes match visitors with the most appropriate areas of NSA, and that arrangements work smoothly from first arrival at the Visitor Center onwards.
(C) But it's not just about visits. The UKLT also helps maintain existing relationships, and aims to identify new areas where there are opportunities for GCHQ and NSA to work together for mutual benefit. These opportunities can be identified from within either organisation - but just as often it is the liaison officers who can spot things that need to be done, through being able to take both a UK and US perspective. And, with GCHQ's backing, the UKLOs aim to make an active contribution themselves, especially where our diverse Sigint backgrounds are directly relevant to the issue at hand. This has been particularly true over the last two years, as we have worked together to support coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.
(U) Besides work, we are also a source of advice on cultural and historical issues. We deliver regular briefings on how real footballs are round; why it's possible for beer to be too cold; and why petrol (sorry, gas) at $\$ 2$ a gallon is really very, very cheap. We are also on hand to explain
that 4 July isn't really all that historically significant, and that we're glad the Royal Navy left enough of Fort McHenry standing to make a great day out for the kids. But seriously - the UKUSA relationship is important to US national security, and absolutely critical to the UK. We are grateful to all those at NSA who devote so much time and effort to working with us as partners, and who help ensure GCHQ-NSA collaboration remains an important success story.
(C) Feel free to visit us any time in 2B7042 (or ring 2B7042 ) if you would like our help on any issue, or simply to find out more about UK-Script. You can also visit the GCHQ web, available via NSA net at: $\square$
