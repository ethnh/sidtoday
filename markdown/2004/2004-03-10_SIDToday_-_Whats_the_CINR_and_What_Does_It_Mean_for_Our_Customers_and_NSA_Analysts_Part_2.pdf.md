(U//FOUO) This is part 2 (and final) of article. If you missed it, see Part 1 .
(U//FOUO) The IN and LOE Structure Project Teams are exploring a request format that is logical, binned, allows for tracking, and contains standard language while still providing for individual comments.
(U//FOUO) The common language for INs will be based upon the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF) as described in Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID) 2/3, dated 23 July 2003. The NIPF provides the President's priorities for the Intelligence Community, described in geographic, topic, sub-topic format. The NIPF structure will facilitate research and reduce duplication of needs submitted.
(U//FOUO) The Products and Services Project Team is developing an accepted list of all products and services NSA produces or provides to customers.
(U//FOUO) The Process Logic Team recently developed a high-level description of the flow of information requests from the customer entry to NSA through the SIGINT production cycle. A follow-on team will vet the flow and provide operational needs.
(U//FOUO) The teams are making great progress; that progress is being vetted with our stakeholders, customers and analysts to ensure that we're on the right track. At the same time, the process owners in CRD, A\&P, and DA are determining how current tools and programs fit into the new process flows, and identifying gaps and solutions. Implementation of solutions will be incremental and will evolve over time.
(U//FOUO) The project sounds ambitious, and it is. But we believe our goals are achievable and can transform our business processes, better serve our customers, and help return valuable analytic time to analysis.
