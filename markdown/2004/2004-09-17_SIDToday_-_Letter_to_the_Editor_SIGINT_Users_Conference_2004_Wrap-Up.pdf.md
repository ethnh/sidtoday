Comment: (U//FOUO) Unfortunately, I was not able to attend this year's effort, however, I heard it was a great event. I am currently planning on an NGIC Day at NSA for 7 Dec 04. One word of caution is NGIC, NASIC, ONI, etc. are now Service Production Centers (SPC's)...no longer just S\&T [science \& technology] Centers. We are responsible for anything and everything related to ground forces, from tactics, doctrine, equipment to S\&T. (I bet, though, it was someone from an SPC who said "S\&T Center"....)
