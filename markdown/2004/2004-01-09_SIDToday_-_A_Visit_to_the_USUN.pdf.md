# (S//SI) A Visit to the USUN 

FROM: $\square$ and $\square$ China Foreign Affairs Branch (S2B34)
Run Date: 01/09/2004

## FROM: $\square$ <br> China Foreign Affairs Branch (S2B34)

(TS//SI) On 11 December 2003, we had the opportunity to travel to the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York to meet with some of the most important customers of the China diplomatic shop. As new language analysis and intelligence analysis interns in S2B3, this opportunity to learn first-hand how SIGINT shapes American negotiating tactics at the UN was truly exciting. After a very early start, a three hour train ride and a long wait in the rain for a taxi, we arrived anxious to begin.
(TS//SI) We had the chance to meet with NSA representative to USUN, $\square$. He let us know that $85 \%$ of the intelligence the Ambassador to the UN sees is SIGINT. $\square$ emphasized that USUN is a tactical SIGINT environment and the Ambassador and policy makers rely on our fast, accurate reporting. $\square$ introduced us to $\square$ who is the Senior Advisor on North Korea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Proliferation Issues. She told us about the important role that China is playing in North Korean negotiations and stated that SIGINT from NSA is critical to UN negotiations.
(TS//SI) We also met with Virginia Bennett, one of the contributing authors of UN resolution 1511 on Iraq. She told us how the reporting from our shop influenced the Secretary of State and changed history. The reporting from our shop informed the Secretary of State and the U.S. Ambassador to the UN that it had the votes needed to assure the adoption of Resolution 1511. It was thrilling to see the impact that our reporting had on world events.
(TS//SI) This experience provided us as analysts an invaluable opportunity to meet and talk with our customers face to face. We forged new relationships of understanding and cooperation that will expand future China diplomatic support to the USUN customer.
