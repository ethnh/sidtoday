NSA and Third Parties in Pacific seek to exchange terrorist threat warning info (S//SI)
(S//SI) Earlier this month, NSA and some of our Third Party partners from the Pacific area met in Hawaii to discuss a new initiative. The plan proposes -- completely separate from our existing bilateral relationships with the participants -- an immediate collaboration on the exchange of threat warning information, and offers a communications mechanism whereby NSA will act as a conduit for passing terrorist threat warning information among participating nations, much like we did for the 2004 Summer Olympics.
(S//SI) This month's meeting included delegations from Singapore, Thailand, and South Korea. Discussions went well, and the attendees asked many questions. Each of the delegations understood the proposal and they are taking it back to their governments for consideration. We should hear back from them all by early January, after which time we will begin to plan on a Directorate-leve conference in April, which will include DIRNSA and the principals from each participating nation.
(S//SI) When I reported to the Director at the end of the conference, I told him I thought the conference was "eminently successful," and that "the Third Parties were engaged and receptive." I am confident that we are on our way to a successful multilateral collaboration in the Pacific.
(U) While I have your attention, I'd like to take a moment to say that, as we reach the end of another year, I find myself marveling at everything we have initiated, experienced, and accomplished. We continue to find new, imaginative, and fruitful ways of reaching out to our partners, enabling them so they can better contribute to our mission. Across the globe and here at home, NSA and FAD have dedicated partners in the truest sense of the word. Some are foreigners and some are Americans, but they are all associates and colleagues, and without them we would not have been able to even contemplate some of the progress we made this past year. To all of our partners, here and abroad, I want to offer a heartfelt thank you, and warm wishes for a wonderful and safe 2005.
