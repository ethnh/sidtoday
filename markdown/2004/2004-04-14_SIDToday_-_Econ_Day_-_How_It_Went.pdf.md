(C) Despite bad weather, traffic snarls, road construction, detours, and a complicated visitor process, they came! Well over 100 external guests gathered here at NSA on Friday, 2 April 2004, for Global Economic Security Day. As part of SID's Customer Engagement Program, a new strategy called "Customer Days" has been implemented. "Econ Day" is the second in the series, following behind the highly successful "Law Enforcement, Intelligence Community, Homeland Security Day" in December 2003. Nearly 200 SID managers and analysts also participated in the morning and afternoon sessions, bringing the Friedman Auditorium to near capacity.
(C) Ambassadors, Under and Assistant Secretaries, Directors, managers at every level, and analysts from varied disciplines -- from State, Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, Energy, Transportation, the National Security Council, Executive Office of the President, Federal Reserve, Export-Import Bank, CIA, DIA, NGA, JWAC, FAA, FCC, EPA -- attended the event. Hosted by the SIGINT Directorate's Customer Relationships Directorate, this event was the first interagency forum bringing together policy makers, intelligence managers, and analysts from across the U.S. Economic and Intelligence Communities in a secure setting to exchange information and to promote understanding and networking opportunities.
(U//FOUO) The Friedman Auditorium was filled for the morning plenary session. Alan Larson, Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs, gave the Keynote Address, speaking on the "Importance of Economics in the Geopolitical Context - the Nexus of Economic Policy and Foreign Policy." Other plenary presentations included the "Role of Intelligence to further US Policy" and the "NSA Perspective: the Evolution of NSA reporting in the Post 9/11 Period and the Impact on Economic Intelligence." The morning culminated with a distinguished panel of representative economic clients who described their information needs and the value of SIGINT to their respective missions with representation by the appropriate Senior Executive Account Managers.
(C ) The afternoon featured 11 breakout sessions in conference rooms booked to capacity with a cross section of participants - from Under Secretaries to analysts - from across the Community. These sessions offered wide-ranging economic discussions on regional issues such as trends in East Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America as well as on topical issues such as information technology dependency, threats to economic security, terrorism finance, sanctions, infectious diseases, trade, energy, and the complexities of assessing economic information. Participants have already begun to plan follow on activities to develop contacts made at the sessions and for further networking.
(U//FOUO) The conference was planned and presented by the SID Customer Gateway and the Strategic Intelligence Issues Office, but it couldn't have happened without the support and assistance of scores of people across SID, NSA, and from partner agencies.
(U) Thanks are in order -- to all those who helped and especially to the participants whose presence made the event a success.
