(U) Earlier this week we ran the names of the recipients of the Keystone Award for the first portion of CY04, along with a glimpse of their accomplishments. Turns out, there is one more winner!
(TS//SI) was a strong advocate of leveraging GRSOC's* linguistic resources against this most critical mission. He played a key role in the transfer of a portion of this mission to the Extended Enterprise, not only by providing GRSOC linguists essential background information on how to work a target from a Counterterrorism (CT) perspective, but also on how to improve their transcription processes so that they could more efficiently process this target and ultimately better support the customer.
(TS//SI) This CT-GRSOC collaboration has been a true success story for many reasons. Most notably, with a significantly larger pool of linguists focused on providing timely, accurate support to U.S. troops deployed in Iraq, the best SIGINT support possible is being provided to this highest priority customer.
(U) Congratulations.
