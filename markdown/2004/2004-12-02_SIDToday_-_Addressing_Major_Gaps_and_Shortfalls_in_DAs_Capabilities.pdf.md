(U//FOUO) Addressing Major Gaps and Shortfalls in DA's Capabilities FROM:
SID/Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3)
Run Date: 12/02/2004

S3 to gather subject-matter experts from across the SIGINT system to think of creative solutions. (U//FOUO)
(U//FOUO) In one of my recent Data Acquisition Notes to the Workforce, we talked about various initiatives intended to connect efforts in our line organizations. Today, I want to focus on the new Data Acquisition (DA) Requirements Process.
(U//FOUO) If you are at all like me, the term "requirements process" itself does not sound like a tool for creativity and inclusiveness. Nonetheless, that is the goal. This activity is designed to address major gaps and shortfalls in DA capabilities, ones which can't be handled easily at a lower level in the organization. It will shepherd development of creative, cross-organizational strategies for dealing with these issues in an open but disciplined fashion. The resulting plans will be levied on the appropriate organizations for implementation.
(U//FOUO) The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC, S3C) will serve as Executive Agent for the Requirements Process. In this capacity, the CSRC will work with appropriate technical leaders to bring together subject-matter experts from across the SIGINT system and our many partnerships to examine capability gaps and develop a range of options. Participants are specifically tasked to be open to input and ideas from as wide a field as makes sense, given the specific problem being addressed. The options they develop will be presented to the DA Leadership Team for final approval. Approved plans will generally involve multiple organizations and will be managed in various ways, depending on complexity and scale.
(S//SI) As a pilot project, the first subject-matter experts group, which was assembled in early October, will address the challenges associated with Pick-Your-Own-Number VOIP services. The group has been meeting biweekly to create a strategy to deal effectively with this technology in the SIGINT system. The alternatives and recommendations will be presented to the DA Leadership for approval and tasking. Additional topics are currently being consolidated and will be presented to a board of DA Technical Directors for vetting in early December.
(U//FOUO) Formal documentation of requirements and the transparent reporting of the status and progress of their development is an integral element of this disciplined approach. Webenabled applications are the perfect tools for providing visibility into key requirements actions. Even in this early stage, you can view the requirements process online on the CSRC web page "go CSRC."
(U//FOUO) Each DA group has invested considerable time and resources in establishing its own requirements processes. The Data Acquisition process is designed to dovetail with, not supersede, the group-level requirements processes. It will dovetail equally well with Extended Enterprise requirements processes throughout the SIGINT system.
(U//FOUO) In summary, we hope this will help us bring coordinated SIGINT power to bear on our hardest and most complex problems. Participation and feedback are encouraged!
