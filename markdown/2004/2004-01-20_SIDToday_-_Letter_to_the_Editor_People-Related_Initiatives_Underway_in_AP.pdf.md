(U//FOUO) Letter to the Editor: People-Related Initiatives Underway in A\&P

FROM: SIGINT Communications
(U//FOUO) We received the following feedback on the article People-Related Initiatives Underway in A\&P :
(U//FOUO) I was pleased to see an article coming from Mr. Allen's level that focused on people. My role as a Knowledge Transfer Strategist in S01P, the SIGINT People Office, is to help organizations develop strategies and tools that will allow them to share critical mission knowledge with one another.
(U//FOUO) My hope is that with efforts like a Career Development Board, we're not only concentrating on GG15s, but also the new hires and mid-career personnel. Those are the groups that appear to be struggling the most.
(U//FOUO) I have sent a Knowledge Transfer strategy to the Bubble [deputy directorate] COSs for their input. My fear is that if we don't begin concentrating on a mechanism for ensuring people are passing on what they know, even more critical mission knowledge will be lost than we've experienced over the last decade. I'm hoping that some type of knowledge-sharing activity can be embedded in the performance objectives of all employees, and make them very specific. Some examples could include mentoring, OJT, internal networks, documenting processes and lessons learned, updating webpages or learning portals, etc. I firmly believe that everyone has something to contribute.
(U//FOUO) I would be more than happy to talk to any personnel who might be interested about Knowledge Transfer and how some aspects can be accomplished even without investing a large amount of money.

Respectfully,

# S01P 

Knowledge Transfer Strategist
