(U//FOUO) Establishment of a Human Language Technology IPT
FROM: Leader, HLT IPT
Run Date: 02/25/2004

FROM: Leader, HLT IPT
(U//FOUO) For many years, NSA has tackled the language technology problem in several ways by dedicating resources, both human and monetary, toward the advancement of the linguistic techniques themselves and the development of more efficient analytic processes. Some of these endeavors have been successful; others have not. Because of resource restrictions, many have been directed at a very small percentage of the population.
(U//FOUO) As a result of the recent Human Language Technology (HLT) Assessment conducted by the Office of Corporate Assessments (D5), and as part of the NSA business planning process, Lt Gen Hayden, Mr. Black, and the corporate leadership team have identified HLT as one of a number of key issues that require greater definition. The HLT Integrated Product Team (IPT) has been established specifically to determine what NSA and the extended enterprise need in terms of technological language services, and to develop a roadmap and a budget for getting reliable services to the workforce. Working as a team with representation throughout the Agency, the IPT will ensure that we are focusing on the right solutions and in the proper priority. Our immediate aim is to influence the upcoming FY06 budget cycle. SID/Analysis and Production (S2) is responsible for leading the HLT IPT on behalf of the Director, and Jim Allen has asked me to head it.
(U//FOUO) This is not just a SID issue - it is a Agency issue. HLT is much more than a suite of tools to assist language analysts in getting through stacks of data. HLT includes services for:

- summarizing text, such as end product for our external customers;
- detecting errors in documents and correcting them;
- extracting content out of transcripts and other documents to populate databases;
- build target templates; and
- provide operational data for researchers.

We have an ambitious charter and a great deal of work ahead of us in a short amount of time.
(U//FOUO) We must make the most of this opportunity to determine how HLT can make intelligence analysis more robust. The IPT will be focused on the heart of our core business ANALYSIS, not merely reporting, to satisfy our customers' Intelligence Needs. One area that we will not take on as part if the IPT is language learning technology, although arguably, many of the techniques we will be evaluating are suited for that purpose.
