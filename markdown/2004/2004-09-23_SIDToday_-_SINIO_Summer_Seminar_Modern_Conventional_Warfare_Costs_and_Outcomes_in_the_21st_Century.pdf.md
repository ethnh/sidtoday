FROM: Marilyn Maines
Deputy Chief, Strategic Intelligence Issues (S17)
Run Date: 09/23/2004
(U//FOUO) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present the last in the series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for Summer 2004. "Modern Conventional Warfare: Costs and Outcomes in the 21st Century" will be presented by SINIO for Conventional Military Issues, on Tuesday, 28 September, from 1130-1300 in Room 2N044 . Advance registration is required - see the Brown Bag Series webpage for instructions.

# (U) Course Overview: 

(U//FOUO) A discussion of the potential costs and possible outcomes of modern conventional state-on-state warfare. Modern conventional warfare has taken on new dimensions as a result of a modern "revolution in the military arts." This revolution is the current version of an on-going series of fundamental changes in the way wars are fought now -- and into the future. However, revolutionary weapons systems, strategies and tactics do not necessarily result in assured military outcomes, nor can the weapons systems "costs" be measured simply in monetary units. The presentation and discussion will seek to look at this "Revolution" and provide the participants with a broad understanding of the military and political challenges of modern conventional warfare in the 21st century.
