(S) The Weapon Systems branch within S2J has a new website known as WEPNET. This new site provides analyst with a single access point for SIGINT information on worldwide foreign weapons systems, to include combat aircraft, rotary-wing vehicles, ballistic and cruise missiles, and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles).
(S) On the WEPNET page you will find The Weapon Systems Designator tool . This tool can be accessed without an account so it can be used by anyone working in the foreign weapons systems mission in the areas of research, development, testing, evaluation, and proliferation. The Weapons Systems Designator tool provides a single point look up for the multiple names associated with worldwide foreign weapon systems, to include the:

- Indigenous Name - name given to a weapon system by the country that is developing and producing it
- Export Name - in some cases, the country producing a weapon system exports it under a different name than the indigenous name
- Test Range Designator - temporary designator assigned by DEFSMAC once a developmental weapon system launches for the first time
- WSSIC Designator - official designator assigned by the Weapons \& Space Systems Intelligence Committee (WSSIC).
(U) The Weapon Systems Designator tool is also available on Intelink under the NSA Databases \& Tools at: $\square$
