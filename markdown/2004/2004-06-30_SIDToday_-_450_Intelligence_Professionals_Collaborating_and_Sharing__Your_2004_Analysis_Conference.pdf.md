(U//FOUO) We all know the importance of Information Sharing and many of its principles as well, but there has not been a lot of information available to the analytic community on how to get started on this critical endeavor. The 17-20 May 2004 A\&P* Analysis Conference began to address the specific "how-to's" of Information Sharing, with over 450 participants discussing and practicing information sharing and collaboration.
(U//FOUO) Keynote speakers from NSA, private industry, and other U.S. agencies including the Department of Homeland Security and Defense Intelligence Agency delivered consistent messages regarding the importance and urgency of this work. They emphasized the value of Information Sharing; the development of governance strategies, pilot projects and concrete guidelines; and commissioned analysts to step up to the plate and get the job done.
(U//FOUO) More hands-on analyst participation occurred in the daily break-out sessions and panel discussions that addressed three main issues:

- Ground rules for performing analysis collaboratively
- Successful practices for doing analysis on information from multi-intelligence (multi-INT) sources
- Enablers for performing analysis collaboratively.
(U//FOUO) Workshop presenters, panelists, and analysts hailed from each of the Transformation 2.0 "petals" to include:
- the four Regional Security Operation Centers,
- Defense Intelligence Agency,
- National Geospatial Intelligence Agency,
- our four Second Party partners,
- U.S. Central Command,
- Office of Naval Intelligence,
- NSA Field Activities,
- Joint Interoperability Test Command,
- Naval Information Warfare Activity, and the
- Joint Warfare Analysis Center.
(U//FOUO) This year's conference included a few new features. During a 1-hour "Analysts' Questions and Answers" session, analysts posed questions to Deputy Director for Analysis and Production Jim Allen in Friedman Auditorium. Daily at noon, a "Meet Fellow 2nd Party Analysts" brown bag session was held with each of our four Second Parties. Conference packets included the A\&P Information Sharing Card, a CD on Internet Research, and a book on CD entitled "Bringing Intelligence About."
(U//FOUO) The conference succeeded in communicating the importance and value of Collaboration and Information Sharing at every turn.

(U//FOUO) Thanks to many of you for the excellent feedback the Advanced Analysis Lab received. The AAL welcomes your ideas for ensuring this Conference continues to provide valuable information and contacts for meeting our analytic mission and look forward to receiving
ideas for next year's conference.
