(TS//SI) FOSSWAY: Massive Analysis Attacks
FROM:
Advanced Analysis Lab (S211)
Run Date: 10/15/2004
(TS//SI) Members from the 5-Eyes community met in a very successful Working Party led by the Advanced Analysis Laboratory from 14 to 16 September 2004 to determine next steps in their collaboration on the Fossway project. Fossway is dedicated to the development of massive analytic attacks against global metadata supported by extensive automation.
(TS//SI) It will be a catalyst for developing analytic concepts of the future and proving the practicality and benefits of these new concepts through real-world implementations. These analytic attacks will be designed to extract communities of interest from global networks and identify them and the processes in which they are engaged. Successful analytic attacks will identify new targets, as well as maintain continuity on existing targets. Fossway will help focus analysts on higher level tasks like hypothesis generation and assessment and will seek to automate low level functions like data manipulation. Fossway prototypes will be fully functional and demonstrate that the concepts are achievable. They will become forcing functions for the global SIGINT enterprise to take up these new ideas aggressively and will enable contributions from all organizations and activities both large and small.
(TS//SI) About 90 participants from NSA, CSE, DSD, GCSB, and GCHQ discussed wide-ranging topics organized along four tracks: Analysis and Experimentation, Data Acquisition, Systems Engineering, and Policy. The group's conclusions included agreements to increase analytic rigor, build a common analytic lexicon, undertake joint challenge problems and experiments and leverage prior and ongoing work throughout the SIGINT community, as well as across other government, commercial and academic communities. The group further agreed to form a joint working group to drive the joint experiments. The Working Party set a number of initial actions to be completed within the next 3 months. These include establishing systems engineering documentation, concepts of operations, data inventories, and policy position papers. A series of experiments will also be documented and shared within the group. The Working Party resolved to reconvene in May 2005 to review progress on Fossway.
