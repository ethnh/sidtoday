(U) Advance registration is required; see instructions below.
(U//FOUO) SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is pleased to announce the third of what will be monthly brown bag discussions focused on SIGINT Development topics of interest.
(U//FOUO) The presenters will be experts from the Target Analysis Center (TAC), Network Analysis Center (NAC), Target Technology Trends Center (T3C) and occasionally the SSG staff. We believe that these sessions will be of interest to those who are working in SIGINT development, or are interested in learning more about NSA's SIGINT development activities.
(U//FOUO) This month's featured speaker is Mr. 0000000 from the Network Analysis Center. A synopsis of his topic for discussion is provided below:
(S//SI) The Advanced Network Development and Analysis ( ANDA ) Division within the Network Analysis Center (NAC) has an overall mission of developing and analyzing target networks for customers with the goal of identifying accurate points of access into these networks. Every day ANDA analysts are able to provide customers an accurate view into a target network of interest by searching through a myriad of data sources and making keen analytical judgments based on data that is found. The rapid growth of worldwide telecommunications networks makes the job of a Network Analyst increasingly more complex as the amount of data to search through is quickly becoming larger and larger.
(S//SI) A group of analysts within ANDA are working to develop quicker and more efficient ways of "hunting versus fishing" through network metadata in order to provide accurate network analysis results in half the time that it takes a network analyst to perform that same job today. This talk will provide an overview of the vision and philosophy behind the working prototype as well as a live demo of the ideas already developed.
