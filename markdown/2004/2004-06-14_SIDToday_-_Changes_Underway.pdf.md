# (U) Changes Underway

SID/Deputy Director for Analysis and Production (S2)
(U//FOUO) Note from SIGINT Communications: Jim Allen sent the following message to the A\&P workforce on June 9th :
(U//FOUO) There are a number of initiatives underway that in themselves are important, but taken together add up to a very significant shift in the way we will be doing business in the first part of the 21st century. Included on my short list of high-impact factors are the following:

- Transformation 2.0, which redefines relationships within the cryptologic system and with our partners and clients, and Corporate Governance as it relates to the Extended Enterprise, which the Director reinvigorated late last year. Taken together, they enable a cryptologic enterprise that is even more dynamic and interdependent than the system we live in and operate today.
- Mission Assurance, to ensure that to the extent possible, vital capabilities are not subject to single points of failure.
- Commitment to correct imbalance in demographics at the RSOCs ${ }^{*}$, which manage highturnover workforces to perform high-priority mission.
- Projected growth of 500 NSA civilians each year through FY08. This is in excess of hiring to replace attrition.
- Ambitious work at the RSOCs, which creates opportunities for us to design and fit-out state-of-the-art facilities.
- The promise of "disruptive" technologies like the Next Generation Voice Tools, APATS, and Knowledge System Prototype (KSP), which when deployed could change the way we work. We are also giving increasing thought to the development of strategies and methodologies to complement our "hunting" with improved means of avoiding strategic surprise.
(U//FOUO) In order to accommodate these factors and others, I tasked senior A\&P leadership (to include RSOC Commanders) with developing a plan to determine what missions we are going to work in each node of the Enterprise and how we will manage ourselves to ensure maximum effectiveness and efficiency.
(U//FOUO) Although we are not yet at a conclusion, we have had intensive dialog with the enablers and Agency leadership and are closing in on a plan. Whatever the specifics of the plan that emerges, it is absolutely clear that it will necessitate increased numbers of NSA civilians at locations outside the Fort Meade complex, with most of the growth occurring at the RSOCs. Some mission will be moved from here to there, some mission already there will be augmented, and some new missions will spring up. As you would expect, we will need to adjust manning through a combination of hiring at the destination locations and the transfer of some people.
(U//FOUO) Although each situation will have its own nuances, the Denver Security Operations Center (DSOC) offers a good model as we take the next steps in this journey. DSOC is the new center of gravity for Weapons and Space -- in fact, the Director of DSOC is the Chief S2J*, and at its culmination, more W\&S* personnel will be there than anywhere else.
(U//FOUO) Since its inception, SIGINT has required an exceptional degree of sophistication and flexibility, which has long been reflected in the dispersed nature of our enterprise. We cannot yet describe with certainty how the enterprise will be configured and populated, but I am confident that if we seize the opportunity to break free of current constraints, we can realize an even better means of safeguarding our nation than is possible today.

RSOCs = Regional Security Operations Centers
