(U) NSA and GCHQ Senior Leaders Hold Annual Talks

FROM: $\square$
FAD/Country Desk Officer - UK (DP16)
Run Date: 11/12/2004

Transatlantic colleagues make plans -- modernization, info-sharing, increased collaboration on the agenda (U)
(U) From 4 - 6 October, Lt Gen Hayden and GCHQ* Director David Pepper co-chaired the annual NSA-GCHQ Joint Management Review (JMR) at Chevening House. The fine Palladian house, the country residence of the UK Foreign Secretary, dates back to 1630. It is set in 27 acres of gardens, within an estate of 3,000 acres, and is located 23 miles south of London, in the Kent countryside.
(U) While only $1 \& 1 / 2$ days long, and focused on only a few specific issues, the JMR can be considered the year's most senior cryptologic strategic planning conference between the UK and US. It is complemented by a broad range of detailed UKUSA planning conferences conducted by various mission and support staffs throughout the year. This year, more than 20 senior leaders from across NSA and GCHQ participated -- including DIRNSA and DIR GCHQ, the mission directors for SIGINT and IA, senior general counsels, and senior technology/capability providers.
(U) The results of the conference were quite expansive, and may be characterized as follows:

- Broad agreement that the relationship remains strong across SIGINT, IA, and enabling/support functions;
- Consensus that our respective modernization programs are better-connected this year than last -- and commitment to ensure still further improvement;
- Agreement to pilot one or more initiatives aimed at exercising the US commitment to expanded information sharing with the UK;
- An understanding that change is a fact of life (whether that means the mission dispersion now underway by NSA or the possibility of security community changes attendant to pending US legislation) and that NSA and GCHQ must work hard to keep one another apprised and well connected throughout (actually one of NSA's Special US Liaison Officer, London's key responsibilities);
- A validation of the common cause that joins our two nations and their cryptologic organizations -- the Directors will sign a statement to this effect as a component of the formal conference proceedings; and
- Strengthened connections between NSA and GCHQ senior leadership that will enable greater UKUSA collaboration across the coming year.
*(U) Notes:
GCHQ, the Government Communications Headquarters, is based in Cheltenham, England
