(U//FOUO) Here at SID today, we get a fairly regular stream of feedback on the articles we post. The comments range from bad to good. But occasionally we get feedback such as this one:

1. Was the content in this article relevant to you?
--Are you kidding, it changed my life.
2. Was the content in this article valuable to you?
-- I will never look at SIGINT the same way again.
3. Were you able to find all of the information you were looking for in the article or the links from the article?
--That, and then some -- what a cornucopia of insight.
4. Please provide any feedback on the content of the article.
-- I don't know who wrote this, but they are underpaid at any salary. What a magical combination of words, words that inspired, words that informed, words that changed the meaning of existence.
5. Please provide suggestions for future article content.
-- I barely know if I can ever read another word and feel the same.
(U) Well, the feedback may not always be so lofty, but keep those letters coming! Have a good weekend.
