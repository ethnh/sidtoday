(U//FOUO) The Reporting Board - What Can It Do for You?

FROM: $\square$
The Reporting Board (S12A)
Run Date: 08/25/2004
(U//FOUO) Yesterday's story gave an overview of the Reporting Board. Here's more about their products and services:

# (U//FOUO) What can we do for you? 

(U//FOUO) The RB maintains The Reporting Page ; "go reporting" in your browser will take you to the one-stop shop for all your reporting needs. The Feedback button on this page enables you to inform the board of any shortage in that shop. This page contains, among other working aids:

- a Guide to SIGINT Products and Services ,
- Report Coordination,
- Correcting SIGINT Reports ,
- Write-To-Release,
- Guide to Foreign Release ,
- TELIRs, etc.

The information in these handy guides is taken from formal policy guidance and, in consultation with senior A\&P (S2) reporters, put into a more user-friendly form. Hard-copies may be ordered by contacting the Reporting Board -- and if you have a suggestion for a booklet, please let us know.
(U//FOUO) The Board also publishes the Reporting Forum, an aperiodic compilation of answers to questions from reporters, explanations of policy issues, and general advice on reporting style and substance. The Forum often generates still more questions, through which the Board is able to get a feel for what's on the average reporter's mind, and, if the answer is not within our purview, to raise the issue with the appropriate organization.
(U//FOUO) Another source of reporting information that the RB helps populate is the SIGDEV learning portal Intelligence Reporting and Dissemination Community of Interest (unfortunately, access is currently limited to certain browsers).
(U//FOUO) Customer Response is often called on to provide input to various conferences such as the worldwide Cryptologic Support Group (CSG) conference, held in May 2004. Board members put together a package of working aids for the participants and posted it on The Reporting Page as well, for field representatives who weren't able to attend.
(U//FOUO) The Board also springs into action when a new operational initiative entails training, or a shift in perspective. The seminar on Tear-Line Reporting held in Friedman in June was organized by the Board, which is still answering questions generated by the presentation. (Watch for the announcement of a second session of the seminar to be held in mid- to late September.) Previous seminars presented by the board covered such topics as "Who Is a U.S. Person?" and "Anatomy of a CIA Report." We also help organize tailored training sessions requested by individual work centers on these topics, when a need is expressed. This can also be arranged as part of the Board's "House Calls" initiative, in which an office asks us to review their reporting for a certain period and provide feedback, both "yes, you're doing this right" and suggestions for improvement. Again, these are coordinated with the Product Line and the Customer Response Unified Reporting Service center for the PL.
(U//FOUO) Our members also act as advocates for reporters by representing Customer Response in forums such as the Intelligence Community Tear-Line Working Group and the IC
Report Recall Working Group. This enables us to find out what direction our IC colleagues are moving in, and how Corporate and SID Policy will deal with these matters...and enable Customer Response to prepare to meet the challenges that arise.
(U//FOUO) Any further questions? E-mail us at @nsa or dl rb, call us on or use the Reporting Page Feedback button. Let us know how we're doing!
