(U//FOUO) New Intelligence Oversight Training Process
FROM: $\square$
SID Senior Oversight Executive

FROM: $\square$
SID Senior Oversight Executive
(U//FOUO) I am extremely pleased to finally be able to implement the new process for meeting the annual Intelligence Oversight (I/O) training requirement. For the first time, all SID employees will be able to access the required reading and register their compliance in a common way via the web. Our hope is that the system will also help us provide more comprehensive compliance statistics to the NSA Inspector General's office.
(U) Please read the 5 W's below for more information on what this means to you:

WHO : (U//FOUO) The requirement applies to ALL SID EMPLOYEES, including civilians, military, contractors and integrees. In general, if your organizational designator begins with "S," you should be using this process. However, it is not meant to supplant other systems in use by external elements. Most field sites, for example, already have similar web-based systems that employees at those locations should continue to use.

WHAT : (U//FOUO) The basic I/O training requirement is to read annually the legal documents that govern our mission in SID. There are now five documents that you are asked to review:

- Executive Order 12333,
- USSID 18,
- NSCID 6,
- DoD Regulation 5240.1-R and
- NSA Directive 10-30.

The first three are the core documents covering NSA's legal authorities and restrictions and the definition of SIGINT. The latter two implement the Executive Order within DoD and NSA, so it's important to be familiar with them as DoD/NSA employees.

WHERE : (U//FOUO) The documents can be accessed via the NSA web at the SID I/O training webpage. The first time you log on to the system you'll be asked to register and obtain a password. In subsequent visits to the site, you will simply enter your user ID along with that password. You are not expected to read all the documents at once. While the system cannot bookmark your place in each document, it will keep track of each document you have completed.

WHEN : (U) You may log on to the system at any time to begin. You are asked to have your reading completed by the end of fiscal year, i.e., by 30 September 2004.

WHY : (U//FOUO) The basic principle behind these documents is the right to privacy. Since the SID mission involves electronic surveillance, it is subject to strict control under the U.S. Constitution, federal law, and Executive Branch regulations designed to protect the fundamental privacy rights of U.S. persons. Familiarity with the above documents is therefore an important responsibility of every SID employee.
(U//FOUO) Thank you for your cooperation in using this new process and completing the required reading by the end of the fiscal year. I'd also like to thank those in SID who tested the system and/or helped incorporate enhanced features, our IAD colleagues who shared their expertise with us, and especially our colleagues in the Corporate Applications Division, DC82, who provided the application and worked closely with us to customize it for SID use.
