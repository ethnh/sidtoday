(U) Most of us have relocated -- or we're about to!
(U//FOUO) Those people you're seeing in the hallways laden down with boxes, plants and other paraphernalia could be members of the SID staff. Many elements of S01 and S02 have moved (or are about to move) to new spaces in the north corridor of the Friedman Building (formerly known as Ops 1).
(U//FOUO) For the most part, S01 will be located in 2N007, 2N015 or 2N039 and S02 will be in 2N006, 2N022, or 2N044. Notable exceptions are S01P/SIGINT People and S01X1/Extended Enterprise Management, which are located on the S02 side of the corridor. The old phone numbers still work, but if you need to see someone on the staff, check for their new room number in SEARCHLIGHT before you head over. The move continues through 26 February.
