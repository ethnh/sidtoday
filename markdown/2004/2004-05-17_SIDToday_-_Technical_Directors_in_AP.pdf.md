(U//FOUO) Jim Allen sent the below message to the Analysis \& Production workforce on May 14th:
(U//FOUO) Months ago I initiated an effort to define the role of Technical Directors (TD's) at the office level and above within A\&P. My purpose was to reinforce their roles as members of the A\&P leadership team and to ensure that important functions are performed consistently across our organization.
(U//FOUO) After considering many points of view, and with the benefit of advice from a panel headed by and Jack Israel, I have decided on a set of functions and responsibilities explained in a IU paper. I encourage you to read all four pages, but the essential points follow:

- Technical Directors at the office level and above are their organization's senior authorities regarding analytic and production tradecraft, tools, techniques, and processes. They possess significant expertise and serve as leaders in advancing analysis and production across a broad front. They are not acting principally as Subject Matter Experts (SME's), who play distinctive roles of their own.
- The A\&P TD leads and coordinates the activities of TD's within A\&P, advises DDAP, and chairs the Technical Leaders Council.
- The Technical Leaders Council comprises TD's from across A\&P (see the charter ). It is the venue for considering and deciding significant technical issues, to include new analytical approaches and techniques, and it plays a key role in the capabilities requirements process.
- TD duties can vary a bit from office to office based on the unique needs of the organization, but the variance must be additive. In other words, TD title requires that the core duties listed in the TD paper be performed.
- A minority of technical leaders in A\&P are TD's. Most are drawn from our rich SME population, to which many will return at the conclusion of their TD tour. Many more technical leaders are subject matter experts (SME's), each of whom represents immense intellectual capital. The roles of TD's and SME's are complementary -- both are vital, but they are not synonymous.
(U//FOUO) The standardization of TD positions across A\&P will necessitate some adjustment, but it is consistent with our efforts to increase the rigor of our organizational practices and will also help us to strengthen our treasured technical workforce.
