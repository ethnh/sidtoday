FROM: Sharon A. Houy
DIA Executive Representative to NSA
(U) Beginning in October 2003, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has been rapidly expanding its presence and analytic endeavors with SID to meet our Directors' goals for horizontal integration. We have gone from a one man (so to speak) office to a three-person operation. Many of you have met us: Sharon Houy, the new Executive Representative, and Chris Yates, the first-ever Deputy Representative. Our administrative assistant will be on board soon.

# Our new spaces 

(S//SI) Since our arrival we have been working on new agreements between DIA and NSA on information sharing, beginning with the new MOU regarding the sharing of terrorist information, focused on Iraq. Under this novel agreement, JITF-CT ( Joint Intelligence Task Force Combating Terrorism ) analysts at DIA will gain access to NSA databases to enhance their analysis of Iraqi terrorism issues. This pilot is pushing new information-sharing concepts that we hope will prove to be models for community-wide collaboration in the future.
(S) A new umbrella MOA* between DIA and SID is being approved that will expedite the detailing of personnel between DIA and NSA for future information-sharing activities. This will allow us to follow through in a timely fashion on many new initiatives, including the DIRNSA's offer to re-look Libyan WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) information and DIA's expansion of its analytic presence in the GIS/CAD Multi-Agency Center.
(S/SI) Information sharing between DIA and NSA is nothing new. We've had programs in place for many years with DEFSMAC (forty to be exact!), CIHS, the IOTC, the Counterterrorism product line, the GIS/CAD Multi-Agency Center, Regional Targets, and SSIO. DIA's strength to SIGINT production is its all-source subject-matter expertise and research methodologies applied to the NSA data. We are even running DIA data in the KSP.!
(U) If you haven't met us, have an idea for collaboration or simply a question, please don't hesitate to call us at $\square$ or visit us in our new spaces in
