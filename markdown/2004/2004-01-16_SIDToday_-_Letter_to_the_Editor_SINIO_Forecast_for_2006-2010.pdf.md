FROM: SIGINT Communications
(U//FOUO) We received the following feedback on the article What Does the Future Hold? SINIO Forecast for 2006-2010 :
(U//FOUO) This article was printed, along with the powerpoint briefing and provided to the following USSTRATCOM senior leadership:

- USN CAPT Pete O'Brien (Commander of STRATCOM's Joint Intelligence Center),
- Mr. Len Brown (Deputy JIC Commander)
- Mr. (Senior Intel Analyst), and
- USN CAPT (Chief of STRATCOM's Global Assessments Center).
(U//FOUO) Their feedback to the NSA Office here is the report is "right on" and was "excellent". They are making good use of the information and noted the 06-10 forecast only supports their 2004 assessment they currently have on hand. Just wanted to pass along their kudos to
2004 and any others involved in the report.
Regards from the Heartland (Offutt AFB)
