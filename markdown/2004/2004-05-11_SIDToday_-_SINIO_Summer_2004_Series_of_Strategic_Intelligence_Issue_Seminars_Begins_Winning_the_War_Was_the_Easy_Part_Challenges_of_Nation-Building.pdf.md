# Course Overview: "Winning the War Was the Easy Part: Challenges of Nation-Building" 

(U) As the situations in Afghanistan and Iraq amply illustrate, rebuilding a country from scratch is an extremely difficult challenge. However, there are many lessons, both negative and positive, that can be derived from previous nation-building experiences -- and we ignore them to our peril and that of the countries we are trying to help. This session will scope out the meaning of nationbuilding and how it differs from mere peacekeeping, explore U.S. and UN experiences in postconflict reconstruction, point out the common denominators in successful and unsuccessful nation-building, and connect the lessons-learned to what the U.S. is currently trying to accomplish in Afghanistan and Iraq.
(U) Please consult the SINIO website for more information on future events in this series.
