(U//FOUO) MG Quirk on CTG Walk-About
FROM: Kimberly Beam
Commercial Technologies Group (S3A)
Run Date: 08/27/2004
(U//FOUO) SIGINT Director MG Quirk conducted a SID Walk-About within Data Acquisition's Commercial Technologies Group (CTG) on 9 August 2004. During a Walk-About, the SID leadership has the opportunity to informally meet with an organization without hearing briefings or seeing equipment demonstrations. CTG made the most of this rare opportunity to have the SIGINT Director's undivided attention by talking about programs that highlight the unique work that we do. MG Quirk spoke with various team members and had in-depth discussions on several CTG initiatives.
(S//SI) These discussions allowed MG Quirk a look into:

- HUMINT support to SIGINT enabling,
- the sensitivities encountered with foreign partner enabling,
- SIGINT enabling and counterterrorism initiatives, and finally,
- CTG's efforts to document target technology trends and create target profiles.
(U//FOUO) The Chief of CTG accompanied the SIGINT Director during his visit, providing the interdependencies of the Commercial Technologies mission as well as the linkages to the SIGINT mission. The CTG workforce enjoyed the opportunity to share their unique and rewarding work with the SIGINT Director in a relaxed and informal setting.
