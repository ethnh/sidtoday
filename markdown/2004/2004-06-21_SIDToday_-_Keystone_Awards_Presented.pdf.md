(U) Twice a year the prestigious Keystone Award is presented to an elite few who demonstrate unique linguistic achivements, have made exceptional target contributions and had high productivity over the previous 12-18 months. As you read the accomplishments of the current honorees you will agree that they have indeed fulfilled those requirements:
(C) 000000000 continues to hone his already formidable skills in the Uzbek and Uighur languages by taking advanced training at external language schools. In addition to these languages, 000000 commands native-level fluency in French, a mastery of Turkish, Turkmen and Russian, and considerable expertise in Kazakh and Kyrgyz, and--unique to the U.S. Government--skills in lesser-known languages such as Bashkir, Tatar, Karakalpak, and the historical precursors of the modern-day Turkic languages. 000000 is recognized throughout the entire IC for his linguistic expertise in all of these languages.
