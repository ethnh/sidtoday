(U//FOUO) Status of the DSOC
FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA Signals Intelligence Director Run Date: 03/03/2004

FROM: MG Richard Quirk, USA Signals Intelligence Director
(S) Last summer, the Director announced the creation of the Denver Security Operations Center, or DSOC. (See the DIRgram .) I'd like to give you some background on this decision, and let you know where we stand as of now.
(S//SI) For some years, NSA has realized the potential benefits of creating a TechSIGINT center in Denver, but it is only recently that the time has been right to proceed. Consider these factors:

- SID needs to modernize its TechSIGINT (especially ELINT) capabilities. The best way to do this is by forming an analytic center of excellence to focus on this problem.
- Why put it in Denver? We can achieve greater synergy by collocating SID's analytic functions and Denver's recently consolidated collection functions in a single location. Furthermore, outside of Ft. Meade, our largest concentration of TechSIGINT analysts is already based in Denver, so the move makes sense logistically.
- Since our TechSIGINT expertise will reside mainly in Denver, we have decided that Denver is the logical choice for leading this discipline worldwide.
- In the past, NSA headquarters and field office operations have not been fully integrated. The Director has challenged us to implement Transformation 2.0 by operating as a globally networked system. The stand-up of the DSOC will be a big step in that direction. Also, lessons we learn now in tying together HQ elements and those in Denver will benefit us in future such endeavors we may undertake.
- At one time, the technology did not exist that would allow HQ elements and field elements to collaborate seamlessly. With existing advances in communications and technology, that is no longer the case.
- The events of $9 / 11$ have underscored the need to avoid having "all of our eggs in the same basket" regarding our analytic and technical capabilities. By dispersing our capabilities, the SIGINT system can continue to operate even if work is disrupted at NSA by a threat or other incident.
(S) What is the net result of the creation of DSOC? Denver will continue its traditional mission, but it will take on the added role of being the primary analytic center for TechSIGINT, as well as the overall headquarters for coordinating TechSIGINT worldwide. This endeavor will mark a milestone in integrating and networking our SIGINT system globally.
(S) In terms of governance, the Chief of DSOC will coordinate all efforts on behalf of the SIGINT Director (me). His/her subordinates will report to the three SID Deputy Directors (for Customer Relationships, Analysis \& Production, and Data Acquisition), as appropriate to their function.
(S//SI) Where do we stand now? Our TechSIGINT capabilities continue to transition to Denver, and I believe that things are going well. I hope that you will join me in welcoming the standup of the DSOC, and look forward to the benefits this effort will contribute to the whole SIGINT system.
