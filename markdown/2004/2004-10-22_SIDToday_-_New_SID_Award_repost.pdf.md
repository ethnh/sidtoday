FROM: Charlie Meals
Signals Intelligence Deputy Director
Run Date: 10/22/2004
(U) SID recently unveiled a new honorary award known as the SID Distinguished Service Award (DSA). Charlie Meals, the Signals Intelligence Deputy Director, was the driving force behind the creation of this award. Here's what he had to say about it:

# SID Distinguished Service Award 

- (U) What led you to create this award?

A: (U) SID leadership felt that we needed a distinctive way of showing our appreciation to our people, civilian or military, who have made great contributions to SID and its mission. SID personnel have been doing incredible work, and I expect no shortage of worthy candidates! Although there are Defense Department-level awards to honor distinguished service, this award will be granted by the Signals Intelligence Director for achievements related specifically to SIGINT.

- (U) What form does the award take?

A: (U) It's a gold metal clock with a cover displaying the SID logo. We think recipients will be very pleased with it.

- (U) What are the criteria for bestowing this award?

A: (U) Any SID employee -- at any grade level or rank -- who has made an extraordinary contribution to SID can be considered for this award. This may be an individual or team award. Managers will submit the nominations and the Signals Intelligence Director will make the selections. (Although this is not a "peer" award, I do encourage coworkers to speak up and tell their management that they believe a specific person or team is deserving.) I ask SID leaders to keep this award in mind as a potential way of rewarding outstanding performers -- we want them to know their efforts are appreciated!
(U) Nominations can be made at any time. For details on eligibility and the nomination process, follow this link:
