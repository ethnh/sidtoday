FROM: Counterterrorism Product Line Staff (S2I09)
(U//FOUO) Have you ever considered a job in the CT Product Line but were concerned that you didn't have the requisite qualifications? Don't let that stop you! Read about the experience of someone who began her agency career as a linguist, and never imagined that she had the skills it takes to succeed as a DNI* analyst:
(TS//SI) Carol is a DNI analyst in the Counterterrorism (CT) SIGDEV division who had no DNI experience whatsoever before coming to CT. Hired as a language intern in 1982, and following 11 years of experience as a certified graphic and voice linguist, certified Intelligence Analyst, and senior operational staff officer, she took a break in service from 1993-2002. Following the events of September 11, 2001, she reapplied to the Agency, and was rehired and assigned to CT SIGDEV.
(TS//SI) In the summer of 2002 she took NETA3001 (DNI boot camp) and began working in support of S2I22's Lebanese Hizballah mission. Her development of the Hizballah target produced intelligence which enabled NSA to uncover Hizballah's operational use of E-mail to plan attacks against targets in Israel. She has just begun to work the Iraq target, and provides direct support to forward elements, tipping them to actionable intelligence which often leads to the apprehension of terrorists.
(S//SI) For Carol, the job of DNI analyst in the CT Product Line is a perfect fit: it provides her immense job satisfaction. She views her work as a challenging puzzle to be solved, and enjoys doing research and analysis to find connections between terrorist entities. She finds her management very supportive and responsive to her needs and her mentors and coworkers generous with their time. When asked about her experience in CT, she bubbles over with enthusiasm for the mission and her coworkers.
(U//FOUO) Are you, like Carol, ready to try something new? Come to the CT Job Fair, June 30, 1000-1500 in 2B6008 to learn about exciting job opportunities that may just be the "perfect fit" for you!
