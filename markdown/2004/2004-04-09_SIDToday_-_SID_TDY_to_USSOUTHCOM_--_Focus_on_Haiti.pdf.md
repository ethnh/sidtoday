SOUTHCOM Account Manager (S112)
(S//SI) On 12 March 2004, SID's Deputy Director for Customer Relationships (DDCR), led a SID TDY to the U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) to inform them about SIGINT support for the Haiti crisis, and discuss their top concerns. The TDY was successful on both counts and is just the beginning of significantly ramped up SIGINT attention for Haiti, especially now with thousands of U.S. and multinational interim forces (MIF-H) in country.
(S//SI) In addition to the DDCR, the team included the Deputy Chief Customer Gateway, Latin America and Caribbean Issue Managers, Regional Targets staff, Marine Corps Liaison Officer, Requirements Analysis Center personnel, and the SID USSOUTHCOM Account Manager. MRSOC's Executive Director was also present.
(S//SI) As USSOUTHCOM continues to evolve its mission and plans for Operation SECURE TOMORROW in Haiti, senior personnel listed for us several priorities :

- need for SIGINT support for tactical operations
- illegal armed groups' planning, organizing, and directing attacks against MIF-H
- sources of funding for these groups
- identification of Haitians who are "good, bad, unknown" actors for follow-on action
- former president Aristide's involvement in Haitian affairs

The Requirements Analysis Center (RAC, S16) determined that the results of this Needs Assessment are already covered in the current USSOUTHCOM Information Needs; however, this list will help focus the SIGINT system on what matters most now. We asked USSOUTHCOM to regularly send us Key Reads.
(TS//SI) The USSOUTHCOM J2 gave high praise to strategic-level SIGINT reporting to date. He then stressed his immediate need for tactical level reporting to support the troops on the ground. Our team described actions already taken, including:

- deploying a NIST
- partnering with the Canadians on collection, analysis and reporting
- redirecting an MRSOC analyst to CSG SOUTHCOM
- clearing the way for tactical SECRET level linguists to work traffic,
- performing call chaining analysis on High Powered Cordless Phones,
- enhancing our linguistic pool
- issuing reporting guidance on product release to MIF-H

The J2 remains engaged and interested in the progress on all of these fronts. While there, we also attended the first USSOUTHCOM-hosted Intelligence Community-wide VTC on Haiti currently being held twice per week.
(S//SI) NSA is committed to SIGINT support for SECURE TOMORROW. We will achieve success through continued dialogue to understand our customers' prioritized needs, being transparent with them about our capabilities, plans, and limitations, and quickly taking action that will result in USSOUTHCOM's desired end results.
