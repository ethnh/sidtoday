Here's the conclusion of our article on border security. Part 1 was posted last week. (U//FOUO)

# A Closer Look 

(U) The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (BCBP) consolidates approximately 40,000 employees represented by the uniformed inspector personnel of the United States Customs Service, the former Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization Service--which was abolished as an agency in conjunction with the formation of the Department of Homeland Security--and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. BCBP's prime mission is the inspection of all conveyances of transportation, goods, and people that cross our nation's borders and essentially serve as our country's last line of defense.
(U) The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE) brings together the enforcement and investigative arms of the former Immigration and Naturalization Service, Federal Protective Service, United States Air Marshals, and the United States Customs Service. This effort involves approximately 20,000 employees committed to enforcing the full range of immigration and customs laws, protection of our federal buildings, and the protection of commercial air travel.

## SID Support to Border Security

(U//FOUO) With the statutory creation of BCBP and BICE on 1 March 2003 in the new Department of Homeland Security, SID readied itself to support any new intelligence structures and requirements. SID's Representative to BCBP and BICE, Mr. 000000, worked from the front lines to keep the corporation and our leadership informed about coming changes and helped educate the "new" customer base about our products and services. NSA's Homeland Security Support Office (D08) was also instrumental in helping SID respond to this transition by hosting numerous briefings by the BCBP and BICE intelligence leadership, as well as analyst exchanges with our Production Lines.
(U//FOUO) In actuality, big change comes slowly, and neither NSA nor our customers wanted to disrupt the excellent, long-established SIGINT partnerships. It made sense, therefore, to continue supporting the BCBP and BICE intelligence elements as we had done when they were in legacy Customs and INS. With time, as the new DHS components adjusted to their new home and missions, SID made appropriate updates to the reporting requirements and dissemination lists. Every SID Production Line contributes to the varied missions of BCBP and BICE. If a product deals with issues that may impact our border security, then these organizations should be recipients (check out the MARSP listings for "BICE" and "CUSTOMS").
(U//FOUO) Facilitating the BCBP and BICE relationships with SID is the following team:
