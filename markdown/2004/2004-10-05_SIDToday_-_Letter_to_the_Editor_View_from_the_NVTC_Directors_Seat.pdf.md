(U//FOUO) From:
Comment: Thank you so much for writing this article. I am separating from the AF in June and would love to continue to utilize my linguist skills, but am not willing to move to the Beltway to do so. I had never heard of the NVTC until I read this article and now I'm really excited that I will still be able to help out the intelligence effort from Dallas, Texas, and while attending college.
