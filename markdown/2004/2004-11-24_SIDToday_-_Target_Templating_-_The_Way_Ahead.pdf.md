(U) Target Templating - The Way Ahead

(C) What does it mean to be a SIGINT Hunter? How can we efficiently use multiple analytic and signal exploitation techniques to create a coherent picture of target activity? How can we systematically determine our knowledge gaps? How can a virtual team of S1, S2, S3, NSOC and Cryptologic Partners keep the SIGINT system agile by jointly developing a Target Template that automatically updates itself with the latest information and activity of a target? These are just some of the questions SIGINT Development Strategy and Governance (SSG) is addressing in its Target Templating Implementation Strategy .
(S//SI) The SIGINT Enterprise Strategy, FY-03-08 (SID Placement), Objective 2.2, directs the SIGINT system to "isolate critical intelligence within the target's information space by applying the target templating process" and to "work collaboratively, assemble a coherent target template (or thread) that spans across all forms of communication, all data collected, all forensic analysis of data, and all previous analysis of the target". Since such a comprehensive set of data could only be produced using a variety of analytic techniques, Templating should not be seen as an additional analytic technique, but a unifying framework for analysis and analytic techniques .
(S//SI) For this reason, Target Templating Leads within SSG work with the Social Network Analysis Workcenter to merge social network analysis, communications event analysis and other analytic techniques into the Templating process. These ongoing relationships help SSG to understand how Templating is perceived, what works and doesn't work in applying the Templating methodology and how to make it easier to merge analytic approaches, techniques and tools in order to make Templating more effective as a unifying framework for SIGINT Development. This framework is being realized by simultaneously addressing four distinct courses of action or vectors of the Templating Implementation Strategy.
(S//SI) The first vector is Enabling Technology . One part of this vector will address how to integrate information from the KSP (Knowledge System Prototype) to visualize and automatically update a Target Template. A second part of this vector will provide an interim Target Templating tool for capturing and modeling Target Templates.
(U) The second vector in the Target Templating Implementation Strategy is Skill Development . In this vector, SSG is working with the National Cryptologic School, NETA 3001, the SID Analyst Boot Camp and the SIGDEV Learning Portal to produce videos, briefings and course materials that contain a consistent message of what Target Templating is and how to effectively use it.
(S) The third vector of the Implementation Strategy is Product Line/IMT Partnerships . In this vector, SSG is developing Target Templating POCs within Product Lines and is consulting with analysts in SSIO, OPAC, ICN*, the Global Network Development Activity (GNDA), and other groups to apply Templating to specific Information Needs and target problems. SSG works with Issue Management Teams (IMTs) to apply the Target Templating process, which complements and supports the SID Operating Principles. For example, SSG and the Combating Proliferation IMT have worked together on numerous activities to bring Templating into the IMT's daily focus.
(U) The fourth vector of the Implementation Strategy is Process Integration . SSG recognizes that Templating, as an end-to-end SIGINT process, involves many organizations and individuals. SSG Target Templating Leads work with a variety of Integrated Product Teams (IPTs), working groups and organizations to understand the goals of these groups and how Templating can
contribute.
(U) In the next article, we will focus in on what is happening in the Enabling Technology vector to bring tools to Templating. For more information on the strategy, please contact
