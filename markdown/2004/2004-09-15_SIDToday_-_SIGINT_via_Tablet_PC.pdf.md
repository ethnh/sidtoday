(S) SIGINT via Tablet PC?

Tools and Techniques (S122)

(U//FOUO) S122 is working hard to transform the way NSA disseminates information to its customers. For instance, we are looking into ways to improve the delivery of product reports to customers at external locations. Currently, GAMMA and other categories of SIGINT reports require manual handling -- on-site NSA representatives select, print and hand-deliver the products of interest to their customers. This process is labor-intensive and, since it is paperbased, precludes the use of computer-based tools to sort or analyze the information.
(U//FOUO) How can we do better? We are researching hardware, a Tablet PC, to allow nonNSAnet customers to securely and electronically view classified NSA product reports -- except special series -- from their external locations. The Tablet PC is a portable computer, similar in size and shape to a laptop screen, which allows a user to navigate files using a stylus on the Tablet's touch screen.
(U//FOUO) Through the NCRDEF* office, S122 delivered Tablet PC's to several significant NSA customers at the Pentagon to explore the feasibility of this type of electronic dissemination. In the prototype, the NCRDEF account representatives bulk-copied the daily reports to a USB* flash drive. The USB drive was then delivered to the customers who inserted the media device into their Tablet PC; their requested reports opened automatically for viewing in priority order. Electronic delivery of product reports allows customers to quickly and accurately search their voluminous data for keywords relating to the current hot topic and also promises to provide multimedia capabilities, timeliness, security and metrics to detail which reports have been most valuable to our customers.
(U//FOUO) Much security and policy work remains to be done. S122 is working with IAD's SME (Secure Mobile Environment) IPT* to address the challenging technical issues involved with securing a computing device so that it will remain unclassified after having been exposed to classified data. In the future, it may be possible to disseminate SIGINT reporting wirelessly to these "SIGINT viewing devices," as well. We'll keep you posted as we reach major milestones in this project!
