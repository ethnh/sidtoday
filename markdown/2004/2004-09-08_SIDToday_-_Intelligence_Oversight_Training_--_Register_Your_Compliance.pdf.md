(U//FOUO) Intelligence Oversight Training -- Register Your Compliance

FROM:
SID Senior Oversight Executive (SDV)
Run Date: 09/08/2004
(U//FOUO) In March of this year SID implemented a new process for meeting the annual Intelligence Oversight (I/O) training requirement, offering SID employees a common way to access the required reading and register their compliance. Today I am pleased to report that approximately 6800 of you have already completed the process. While that number sounds large, it's only $60 \%$ of our workforce. By September 30, when we forward our results to the NSA Inspector General, we want to report that we are 100\% compliant.
(U//FOUO) Those who have not yet met the requirement may want to review the 5 W's below for more information. Please note that if you have already read the documents during this fiscal year (1 October 2003 through 30 September 2004), before the new process was started, you are not being asked to reread them at this time. But you are asked to log in to the system and register your compliance.

WHO : The requirement applies to ALL SID EMPLOYEES, including civilians, military, contractors and integrees. In general, if your organizational designator begins with "S," you should be using this process. It is not meant to supplant other systems in use at external locations. Most field sites, for example, already have similar web-based systems that employees at those locations should continue to use.

WHAT : The basic I/O training requirement is to read annually the legal documents that govern our mission in SID. There are now five documents that you are asked to review:

- Executive Order 12333,
- USSID 18,
- NSCID 6,
- DoD Regulation 5240.1-R and
- NSA Directive 10-30 (now NSA Policy 1-23).

The first three are the core documents covering NSA's legal authorities and restrictions and the definition of SIGINT. The latter two implement the Executive Order within DoD and NSA, so it's important to be familiar with them as DoD/NSA employees.

WHERE : The documents can be accessed via the NSA web at:
or via the SID homepage under:
"Latest News:" SID Intelligence Oversight Training. Note to those who have not yet logged in: If you are civilian or military, you probably already have an account on the system, based on records that were pulled from HR in February 2004, and should use your SID as an initial password. You will immediately be prompted to change your password, after which you will be able to log in. Contractors and those without accounts should click on the link to register for an account.

WHEN : You may log in to the system at any time to begin. You are asked to have your reading completed by the end of fiscal year, i.e., by 30 September 2004. You are not expected to read all the documents at once. While the system cannot bookmark your place in each document, it will keep track of each document you have completed.

WHY : The basic principle behind these documents is the right to privacy. Since the SID mission involves electronic surveillance, it is subject to strict control under the U.S. Constitution, federal law, and Executive Branch regulations designed to protect the fundamental privacy rights of U.S. persons. Familiarity with the above documents is therefore an important responsibility of every SID employee.
(U) Thank you for your cooperation in using this new process and completing the required reading as soon as possible.
