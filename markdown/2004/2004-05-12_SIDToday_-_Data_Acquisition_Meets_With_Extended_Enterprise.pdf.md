SID/Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3)
(C) Last week, Data Acquisition held the first of what will be a series of video-teleconferences (VTCs) with field sites around the world. Participating were those sites identified as having predominantly collection activities in the Director's 15 January 2004 Agency-all message "The Extended Enterprise: Where to From Here?" These sites include:

- Menwith Hill Station, Field Station Denver, and the Joint Defence Facility, Pine Gap;
- collection sites in Korea and Thailand;
- the Misawa Security Operations Center;
- the Alaska Mission Operation Center at Elmendorf, Alaska;
- CONUS collection sites at Yakima, Washington, and Sugar Grove, West Virginia;
- the Special Collection Service; and
- the Technical Centers in the Pacific and Europe.

To accomodate the multiple time zones involved, we held an early morning (local time) VTC for sites in the Pacific and Far East, followed by one at lunchtime for sites across the U.S. and in Europe.
(U//FOUO) This initial VTC provided the sites with an overview of Data Acquisition's plans for governance of the Extended Enterprise, our strategy, and how we build the budget. It gave them a preview of upcoming events in which the field might be interested, and introduced the Data Acquisition Extended Enterprise team, which will be the field's primary interface at the DA-level. The VTC also provided the first opportunity for field site commanders to let the Deputy Director for Data Acquisition know directly what is of interest to them.
(U//FOUO) While all of the sites have individual issues and concerns, some common themes emerged from the discussion: Field sites are looking forward to and see great value in working with DA in its new advocacy role, and expect this new relationship to provide them with insight into and opportunities to participate in strategy and budget development activities, schedules, and decision points. It also affords us opportunities to provide field sites with improved visibility into internal coordination within DA and SID, which will help us identify and avoid areas where disconnects are likely to occur and limit any adverse impacts on sites' operations. The sites are eager to reach a decision on processes - either to use those that already exist or to put new ones in place where there are gaps. Communication - how, how often, and when - is widely viewed as a key attribute of this endeavor: the field had a number of suggestions on what would be most beneficial to them.
(U//FOUO) As we continue to step up to our role in managing the extended enterprise, our plans now include a series of site-specific or topic-specific VTCs, at which we can gather together the right audience to address sites' concern and provide further information on upcoming initiatives that will affect their facilities and missions. We are also planning periodic visits by DA management to each of the sites to allow face-to-face discussions and better familiarization with their issues. The feedback from the sites on the VTC has been positive and constructive - the open discussion and sites' willingness to work with us are good first steps in fulfilling the Director's goal.
