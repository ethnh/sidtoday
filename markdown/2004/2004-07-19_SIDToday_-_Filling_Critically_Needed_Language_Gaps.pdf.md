(U//FOUO) Please note that although the connection of the
$\square$ facility with NSA and its employees is U//FOUO, it is highly sensitive information. All are asked to assist in keeping this a low-profile facility with no overt connection to NSA.
(U//FOUO) What's one way NSA is "building the bench" of tomorrow's cryptologic language analysts? - via the Language Enhancement Program (LEP), launched in January 04 by the National Cryptologic School (NCS), the Senior Language Authority (SLA), and Human Resources (HR). The LEP is an intensive global language training program which takes new hires with level $2 / 2$ skills in commonly taught languages (such as French) and crosstrains them to a level $3 / 3$ into a critically needed, less-commonlytaught language (like Arabic.) It is loosely modeled on the successful Russian 15A program of the 1980s.
(U//FOUO) The LEP also enables personnel who already have some knowledge of a critically needed language to enhance their skills to a level 3/3. Participants will be required to meet specified level 2 and level 3 milestones. Depending on the language and the skill level of the participant, the program could take up to three years to complete.
(U//FOUO) The NCS and SID are co-sponsoring the refit of three floors of $\square$ to house both this effort and other training programs related to the DIRNSA-required 3/3 language level. This totally unclassified facility will house two state-of-theart language learning laboratories, as well as a 21st century multimedia language resource center. All classrooms will be fitted with smart boards and lap top computers.
(U//FOUO) The NCS is staffing the effort with teachers from the Defense Language Institute and from the local area. The overall goal of the FY05 program is 60 LEP participants, with at least an additional 60 students every year thereafter. Classes in early October will begin cross-training participants into Arabic, Chinese, and Persian. There will also be enhancement classes in these languages. The LEP will eventually train participants in Korean, Turkish, Dari, Urdu, and Pashto as well. To meet the FY05 goal, the SLA, the NCS, HR, and Security launched an intensive recruiting and hiring effort in February 2004.
