(U//FOUO) Here is part two (and final) of our look back on memorable quotes from SID today's first year. A link to part one is in the "Recent Articles" section of the SID today homepage.

(U//FOUO) You know you are a veteran NSAer if you...

- remember the Marine Guards.
- can remember when you could drive up to the door of Gatehouse 2.
- remember when Route 32 was a 2-lane road. (etc.)

From: MG Richard Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director

(S//SI) Do you know that you are making history? You are! The war we are fighting -- not just in Iraq, but the War on Terrorism -- is a global war. It is history in the making and you are part of it, a critical part.

Software Development Team, Menwith Hill Station

(U//FOUO) It took only one PCS and my husband announced that he was officially a "field rat."

From: Charles H. Berlin III
SID Chief of Staff

(U) First, it is a legitimate function of a technical leader to "tell the geeks when they are done." Seems flip, I know, but no disrespect meant when I tell you what you already know: software is never "done" and somebody has to declare victory. Perfect really is the enemy of good enough.

From: SINIO for Global and Multilateral Issues, and NSA
Representative to the U.S. Mission to the UN

(S//SI) [Quoting a U.S. UN official] "For obvious reasons [NSA] doesn't get the public praise, but they should know how much more effective and more successful they allow us to be. It's one of the real reasons, beyond luck, that we are the best at what we do."

From: SIGINT People Office/Workforce Advocacy Team
Thursday, November 20, 2003
(U) For the first time in over a decade more people are joining the NSA workforce than leaving it. Did you know that the SIGINT Directorate hired 472 new employees in FY03? Existing hiring levels are expected to continue to increase!

From: Sgt $\square$ USMC

(U) If there's one thing my experiences deploying around the world have taught me, it's that these trips are ALL once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Each one is a unique and exciting adventure.

From: IA Intern

(U//FOUO) Being in the field will change the way you do SIGINT forever.

(U//FOUO) Here's a list of commonly used transcription terms. It may give some insight into what it's like to be a transcriber (or "scribe" for short)!:

- "ears": a scribe's earphones. "Put on your ears and come listen to this cut."(etc.)

From: SIGINT Communications and $\square$ Second Party Affairs Office (DP11)

(C) Did you know that NSA has a Second Party relationship with "Middle Earth"? [Regarding our relationship with New Zealand.]

From: TSgt, USAF
Tuesday, December 23, 2003
(U//FOUO) [Regarding a NIST deployment to Iraq] Would I do it again? Absolutely! This is what I'm supposed to do - I'm in the military... we kill people, and blow things up. It's our job. It's my job to make sure that the people doing the overall mission do it with the best intelligence in the world. And NSA has it.

(S//REL) I now see my work as both a privilege and an awesome responsibility. When I return home, I surely won't miss the grueling shifts, the dirt, the food, or the occasional fear. But I'll leave knowing that this country is well on its way to recovery. And we have helped.

From: Charles H. Berlin III
SID Chief of Staff
Wednesday, January 14, 2004
(S//SI) As many of you know, our forces in Iraq are dropping bombs on the strength of SIGINT alone. We are proud of their confidence in us, but have you ever considered the enormous risk the commanders are assuming in this regard? Are you ready to share that risk? Makes you think about how critical your best efforts are.

(U//FOUO) [Referring to DIRNSA's paper on the Extended Enterprise] The paper restates that "All SIGINT and related activities are under the direct operational control of the Director of SID or his designated representative... In short, headquarters elements will exercise operational control of their activity wherever it is found across the enterprise..."

(U) The growing/increasing use/application of the slash/backslant in written/printed and spoken/oral communication/missives has become something of an epidemic/scourge.

(U) I am excited to serve at NSA at this critical juncture in U.S. history. Now I am immersed in a knowledge-based environment, where continuous learning is facilitated and expected. Crosstraining and flexible tracks are open to me; TDY's and IC-wide opportunities fill my dreams.

From: MG Richard J. Quirk, USA
Signals Intelligence Director
Friday, February 13, 2004
(S//SI) In the coming months, U.S. military and intelligence personnel will begin a Spring Offensive in the Afghanistan-Pakistan area intended to locate and eliminate the al-Qa'ida leadership. We in NSA have no higher priority than to support this Spring Offensive, and we must be prepared.

From: Jim Cusick
Assistant Deputy Director for Data Acquisition (S3)

(U) [On the subject of senior executives] If you never get elevated, you still know your family loves you, you live in the greatest nation on the globe, you are making a difference for your fellow Americans and those you love, you undoubtedly have a job twice as interesting as anyone outside the IC, you are well paid, you are eating regularly, you have never slept on a grate.... You get the picture. Your value as a tremendous asset to your country, your family and your Agency will never hinge upon elevation.
