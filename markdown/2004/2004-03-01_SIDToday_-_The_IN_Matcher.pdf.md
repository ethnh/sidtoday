(U//FOUO) SID has been working hard to automate the SIGINT report release process as much as we can. The benefits of this are clear: anything that will save analysts time and effort (and annoyance) will result in higher productivity and greater accuracy in getting the reports where they need to go, in the proper format.
(U//FOUO) One effort in this regard is the development of an Information Needs (IN) Matcher, which will help analysts determine which INs and key facts (Essential Elements of Information, or EEI's) are associated with their reports. This will no doubt come as a relief to the analysts, who have felt overwhelmed in performing the necessary research to properly cite INs while the number of INs has continued to grow.
(U//FOUO) Development of the IN Matcher has taken place in two phases. First, an IN Matcher prototype has been created. It is based on a Production Services (S21) pilot that was designed to ease the transition from the old NSRS (National SIGINT Requirements System) to the new NSRP (National SIGINT Requirements Process). In the second phase, multiple approaches and technologies will be evaluated in a laboratory environment to see which technology (algorithms) work best. One tactic was to create a web site that "suggests" appropriate INs for draft reports. If the performance is good, then the tool could be integrated into report authoring tools.
(U//FOUO) Where are we now?

- The preliminary operational testing of the prototype has been conducted.
- The laboratory testing will be conducted from March through July.
- Upon conclusion of the testing, the laboratory results will be analyzed and a plan developed for next steps in acquisition and integration into the IN Matcher tool.
(U//FOUO) The initial testing showed fair results with the INs, but poor results with EEIs. Customer Gateway (S11) is working with S2 to adjust the operational test plan, and with the vendor to evaluate the results. They are also finalizing the evaluation plan for the laboratory. At a recent stakeholder conference, key partners and stakeholders reviewed the evaluation plan and evaluation criteria, and recommended products to test. Customer Gateway appreciates the collaboration of many analysts from S12, the Advanced Analytic Lab, RAD, TRAILBLAZER, CMM, and other organizations as they work to make the IN Matcher a reality!
