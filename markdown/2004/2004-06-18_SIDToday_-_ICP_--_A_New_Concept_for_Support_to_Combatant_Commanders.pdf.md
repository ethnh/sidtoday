(S) Since assuming the newly formed post of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) in March 2003, Dr. Stephen Cambone has made improving intelligence support to Combatant Commanders a priority. Based on the study "Taking Stock of Defense Intelligence" undertaken at his direction last fall, and lessons learned from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the USD(I) has introduced a new concept called "Intelligence Campaign Planning." The effective support of Combatant Commanders requires support agencies to create very detailed plans and the USD(I) has initiated an effort to come up with a comprehensive methodology for developing an integrated, fully coordinated, and executable Intelligence Campaign Plan (ICP).
(S) To help focus the ICP effort, a decision was made to develop a plan in support of the Combined Forces Command (CFC) Korea -- specifically OPLAN 5027. On 2 March 2004, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence \& Warfighting Support, LTG Boykin, and Joint Chiefs of Staff J2, MG Burgess, co-hosted a conference at the Pentagon to design the way ahead.
(S) Representatives from the Services, a number of Commands, and the Intelligence Community attended. BG DeFreitas, United States Forces Korea (USFK) J2, provided an overview of OPLAN 5027, outlining the campaign's operational objectives and identifying the key Priority Intelligence Requirements for each phase of operations. The group agreed to follow a mission analysis format for information gathering with the goal of producing an ICP that supports the CFC Commander's Ten Critical Fights across all four phases of the OPLAN.
(S) Following the kick-off session, COL $\square$ of the USD(I)'s Office and LTC $\square$ of the Joint Staff J2 facilitated VTCs in late-March and mid-April to review the progress of the mission analysis being conducted. It was decided that the ICP Working Group would take advantage of NSA's Rock Drill 5 (see related article ) being held in Korea 19-23 April to meet in Korea the last week of April.
(S) BG DeFreitas hosted the CFC Korea ICP Conference at the Yongsan Post in Seoul from 28-30 April. COLs $\square$ and $\square$ from the Office of the USD(I) directed the activities. Participants included representatives from the Combat Support Agencies--e.g. the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and NSA (participants from NSAW, KRSOC, and SUSLAK*); the Services; a number of personnel from the CFC/USFK J2 and J5 staffs; and others. Participants divided into focus groups and achieved the objective of the conference -- to establish a methodology and baseline of information -- was achieved.
(S) An aggressive timeline for continuing the CFC Korea ICP effort has been set: the groups are to complete their mission analysis by the end of June; in early July the results will be briefed to Dr. Cambone and GEN LaPorte (the directors of the Combat Support Agencies are expected to attend); the groups then will develop functional Courses of Action that are to be completed by the end of October; between October and December, a draft ICP will be prepared/coordinated and presented to Dr. Cambone/GEN LaPorte; and an ICP "Rock Drill" is planned for January 2005 which will lead to the refinement of the ICP.
(S) As the ICP concept evolves, it is expected to be the comprehensive methodology for integrating intelligence into the Combatant and Joint Task Force Commander's adaptive planning and operations processes. In fact, an ICP for CONPLAN 5077 already has been discussed at
USPACOM and lessons learned from the current CFC Korea effort are to be provided in the August timeframe so that a mission analysis can begin.
