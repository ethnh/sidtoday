(U) As a new team member within the Signals Intelligence Directorate (SID), I have been asked to share my thoughts on my role as the new SID Senior Enlisted Advisor (SEA), give insight as to how I operate, and share the goals I would like to achieve.
(U) The role of any SEA is to advise his/her senior leader on military enlisted issues. The role of SID SEA is to advise the SIGINT Director on all military enlisted matters within SID. In simple terms, all SEA's/NCO's/leaders within NSA have an inherent role of taking care of enlisted personnel. I am here to ensure they stay true to that role. I look forward to working with every member of the SIGINT team, both military and civilian.
(U) My primary goal is to carry out NSA's mission efficiently, and to care for our most valued resource: people. I would like to focus on a training program that supports mission requirements and continues with career progression, while giving both the military and civilian personnel insight and understanding regarding the important roles they play in both the SIGINT mission and the Intelligence Community.
(U) Integrity is not just an Army Value; it's a ways of life. Being up front...calling it as you see it, are both very important to me. I believe in handling problems at the lowest level. At the same time, I don't believe problems get better with age, so see your SER/SEA for assistance. I may come across on the rough side, but I won't stop until we get the right answer. I am new to NSA, but not the SIGINT field. Please stop by and bring any good ideas with you. I am here to learn as well, and in my 27 years I have found that there is more than one way to do things.
(U) In addition to my goals, I would also like to convey my expectations of those assigned to SID. Followers expect leaders to show them the standard and train them to reach it. They expect leaders to lead by example. Additionally, they expect leaders to keep them informed and to care for them. Leaders may have to ask others to make extraordinary sacrifices to achieve goals. Leaders may have to call on them to do things that seem impossible. If leaders have trained their people to standard, inspired their willingness, and consistently looked after their interests, they will be prepared to accomplish any goal, anytime, anywhere.
