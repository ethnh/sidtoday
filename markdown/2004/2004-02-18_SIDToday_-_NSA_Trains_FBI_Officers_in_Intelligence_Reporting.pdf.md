# (C) NSA Trains FBI Officers in Intelligence Reporting 

FROM: Customer Response (S12)

## FROM: <br> Customer Response (S12)

(C) NSA recently hosted students from the FBI Terrorist Reporting and Requirements Section as part of a 2-week FBI course for both new FBI hires and experienced FBI officers who are new to the role of intelligence reporting. The overall objectives for the students included how to be a reports officer, how to write intelligence reports, and how to understand their role in the FBI, the Intelligence Community and the U.S. Government.
(C) Mr. $\square$ from the Office of General Counsel kicked off the 2 and $\AA^{1 / 2}$ hour session with a brief overview of the legal responsibilities and issues facing NSA analysts when preparing information for dissemination. The Customer Response Reporting Board followed with a basic "SIGINT Reporting 101" briefing given by Col. . He provided a general overview of SIGINT and wove in examples and stories to explain the reporting and dissemination process. The final briefing was presented by Ms. $\square$ from the CT SIGINT Development Branch. Her fast-paced briefing on convergence highlighted real world issues faced by CT analysts from collection to dissemination.
(C) It was a good opportunity for us at NSA to share how we do our work and provide insight into the complexity and difficulty of our business. It also was an opportunity to dispel some Hollywood myths about NSA. That said, we believe some of the FBI reports officers were more impressed by the actual facts about NSA than by what's shown in the movies! The FBI analysts' consensus was that the briefing hit the mark. Their comments and questions will help us to tailor future presentations, to include an encore presentation of the briefing planned for March and a formal course for customers that Customer Gateway is in the process of coordinating.
