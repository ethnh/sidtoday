(U) Who Is Responsible for Information Needs?

FROM:
Information Needs Division (S111)

(U//FOUO) Many of you have probably heard of Information Needs, commonly referred to as INs. You may have wondered, "Who is responsible for these INs?" The answer is, S111 Customer Service Managers, also known as CSMs.
(U//FOUO) The CSMs in S111 are a very diverse group of people comprised of collection managers, intelligence analysts, data flow managers, signals analysts and linguists. CSMs are responsible for the end-to-end health of the customer's INs. Some CSMs focus on and respond to INs in a particular region of the world such as Southeast Asia or Middle East/North Africa. Other CSMs specialize on a particular topic such as Information Operations or Counterterrorism INs. The CSMs work closely with counterparts in SID and IAD, and take the appropriate action on the customers' INs to provide the best support possible.
(U//FOUO) CSMs play a critical role in the Information Needs process, as they interact with the external customers and members from the SIGINT Requirements Validation and Evaluation Subcommittee (SIRVES) to understand and cultivate their INs. CSMs often coordinate with members of SIRVES to rework a duplicative IN by identifying other INs that are similar and suggesting a course of action to take. They collaborate with SIRVES when it comes to negotiating with a customer regarding a due date for a LOE or Research IN response that cannot be met or needs to be extended.
(U//FOUO) CSMs also partner with Senior Executive Account Managers (SEAMs) and Account Managers (AMs) to ensure a healthy, successful relationship with the customers in regards to their current and future requirements for INs. Within NSA, CSMs collaborate with personnel from the SID Production Lines and Data Acquisition on the IN and the crafting of the Level of Effort (LOE) Statement.
(U//FOUO) LOEs are a very important part of the Information Needs process. The LOE is the vehicle used by the Unified Cryptologic System (UCS) to respond to INs. The LOE is a characterization of how the SIGINT system can respond to an intelligence need given current priorities, resource constraints, and legitimate capabilities. The LOE seeks to provide customers with a realistic assessment of the SIGINT system's ability to satisfy an IN from a production and dissemination perspective. Sometimes the LOE contains aspects of access and collection, too. LOEs are fluid documents and are routinely updated.
(U//FOUO) The S111 CSMs are the stewards of the INs and LOEs, managing over 3,200 active INs in the National SIGINT Requirements Process, making each day as a Customer Service Manager busy, diverse, and challenging. The CSM role allows one to glean an overview of the entire SIGINT System's capabilities and resources, be exposed to all collection disciplines, and interact with analysts, collection managers, and customers from the entire Intelligence Community.
(U//FOUO) Being a CSM is rewarding, knowing that you have contributed to the War on Global Terrorism (GWOT) and supported the war fighter through the National SIGINT Requirements Process. If you would like to learn more about the Information Needs Process, please contact S111 at $\square$ secure or drop us a line at our email alias "DL NSRPTEAM".
