(S//SI) SIGINT lead information and reporting produced by the MRSOC and the South America Narcotics Branch played a primary role in the recent arrest of three Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) members. The SIGINT indicated that FARC group leader Rafa was in the process of finalizing an activity planned for March 30th. When the U.S. Embassy in Bogota tipped Colombian authorities to the information, a team of Colombia National Police succeeded in finding and arresting Rafa (true name now known to be $\square$ ) and two associates. Additional members of Rafa's group were arrested late the following day (March 31th).
(S//SI) Questioning of the suspects confirmed that they had planned to carry out assassinations of Americans -- specifically U.S. Embassy Marine Security Guards -- in one of Bogota's principal nightclub and entertainment districts on the night of March 30th. Based on this information, Colombian National Police raided an apartment in the Suba neighborhood of Bogota and seized two Walther handguns equipped with silencers and five magazines of ammunition that were intended to be used in the attack. The cell phones used by Rafa and other members of the group were also recovered.
(U) Note from SIGINT Communications: Congratulations to all involved in this successful operation!
