(U) Social Network Analysis (SNA) is an analytic approach that uses sociology, graph theory, and statistics to characterize the structure and behavior of networks and individuals. Understanding the target's social network enhances and enables intelligence production.
(U) The Target Analysis Center's Social Network Analysis Workcenter (SNAW) is developing an integrated Social Network Analysis methodology supporting event analysis within the SIGINT community. SNA includes information on actors (people, organizations, companies, etc), attributes (facts about or properties of actors), relations (socially meaningful ties across actors), and metadata (from information source). By mapping and analyzing the pattern of social interactions ('works with', 'knows', 'receives money from', etc.) between individuals, SNA illuminates the scope, complexity, and structure of networks, and the roles individuals play within them.
(U) SNA can provide an overview or "organizational snapshot" of a target organization and show the degree of 'interconnectedness' of the target organization and its individuals. Key individuals who play significant social roles can be identified. This, in turn, supports SIGINT Development efforts and potentially highlights exploitable weaknesses in targets for the target analyst.
(U) Understanding the character and behavior of key individuals within the mission area also supports military operations planning and execution. Additionally, SNA may provide metrics for Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) within a campaign.
(U) The SNA Workcenter is also charged with capturing and translating the analyst's information needs into valid requirements that enhance the total target analytic results.
(U) Here is just one example of how work in this division leads to intelligence:
(TS//SI) SNAW Supports SSIO Project : SNAW analyst continued to work with members of the SIGINT Support to Information Operations (SSIO), Foreign Information Operations Threat Division (S2K1) to support an SNA project on the Mujahedin-E-Kalq (MEK) terrorist group in Iraq. SNAW provided initial analyses and visualizations for the MEK project to help refine analytic hypotheses and focus on potential high-value areas for analytic exploitation. This project will contribute to an in-depth SIGINT assessment report on the MEK and should provide insight on numerous aspects of the target, including its power structure and potential avenues for influence.
