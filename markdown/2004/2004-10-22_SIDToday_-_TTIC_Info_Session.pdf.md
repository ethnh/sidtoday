# (U//FOUO) TTIC Info Session 

FROM:
NSA Liaison Officer, Terrorist Threat Integration Center
Run Date: 10/22/2004
(U//FOUO) Are you interested in being a part of a "joint venture" that has primary responsibility in the U.S. Government for terrorism analysis, including responsibility for the day-to-day terrorism analysis provided to the President and other senior policymakers? If so, read on.
(U//FOUO) SID is committed to filling 10 additional NSA positions at the Terrorist Threat Integration Center this year, including:

- 5 Intelligence Analysts
- 1 Deputy Group Chief, International Terrorism Group
- 1 Senior Intelligence Officer - TTIC Watch
- 1 Foreign Liaison Officer
- 1 Intelligence Officer - Target Identities
- 1 Intelligence Officer - Information Sharing

All of these positions will be advertised through the Competitive Selection process. We encourage experienced, hard-working intelligence officers to apply.
(U//FOUO) Some background on TTIC: TTIC stood up on 1 May 2003, as directed by President Bush in his State of the Union Address. The scope and complexity of international terrorism requires the Intelligence, Law Enforcement, Homeland Security, Defense, and Diplomatic Communities to join forces and combine knowledge. As a result, TTIC is composed of partner organizations including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency and others. While today TTIC does not "belong" to any department or agency and reports directly to the DCI, the August 2004 Executive Order establishing a National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) calls for the NCTC to undertake all functions assigned to TTIC. TTIC now has over 500 employees (including USG staff and contractors). The organization will grow even more once it transitions to NCTC. Since June 2004, TTIC has been residing in a well-appointed new facility near Tysons Corner, Virginia, along with parts of the DCI's Counter-Terrorism Center (CTC) and the FBI's Counter-Terrorism Division.
