(U) New Speaker Series SIGINT Chronicles: Adventures in Analysis

(U//FOUO) Intelligence Analysis Development Program participants recently kicked off a new speaker series: SIGINT Chronicles: Adventures in Analysis . Its aim is to be an informal venue for NSA employees, past and present, to share their experiences with junior employees in a casual setting. There are a lot of tool courses out there, but little that captures the human art of analysis or the strong NSA analytic tradition. The IA Skill Community, the Advanced Analytic Lab and the Center for Cryptologic History all provided support for the event, which was the product of an offhand remark that someone recognized as a good idea.
(S//SI) Milt Zaslow, an NSA legend and our first speaker, built analysis from the bottom up during the Korean and Vietnam wars. His hour with us discussing the art of analysis against new enemies with unfamiliar tactics was inspiring and encouraging. As one attendee commented, "It's great for us young whippersnappers to hear from someone who's been there and done that. I think we can really use those voices of experience to help form our own effective method of tracking our current and future adversaries." (For more on Mr. Zaslow's talk, see The 'Good Old Days'. .)
(U//FOUO) Information on this series and announcements for future presentations can be found on the SIGINT Chronicles webpage. The next talk will be given by Co-Lead of MENA SRTD Telephony and Geospatial Analysis Team, on September 7th.
