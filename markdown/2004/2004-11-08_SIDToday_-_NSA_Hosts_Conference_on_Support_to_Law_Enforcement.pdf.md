(C) Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (CES) hosted a Cryptanalytic Support to Law Enforcement Conference at NSAW from 27-30 September. This conference has the distinction of being the first time that all five SIGINT partners met to discuss cryptanalytic support to our law enforcement partners . In attendance were representatives from the general counsel, policy, and cryptanalytic offices of CSE, DSD, GCHQ, GCSB, and NSA*. Law Enforcement representation included the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and the UK's National Technical Assistance Center (NTAC). The shared goal of the conference participants was to develop a true understanding of the needs of our LEA and SIGINT partners.
(U//FOUO) The first two days involved briefings and discussions focused on legal guidelines and authorities, law enforcement needs, and SIGINT partners' procedures for accepting and fulfilling requests for technical assistance. The rest of the conference focused on discussions highlighting equity-sharing concerns between the SIGINT partners and our LEA partners. While it was clear that the SIGINT partners were interested in supporting our LEA partners, protecting our SIGINT equities was an extremely important issue and discussions on how to protect those equities followed. Through these open and frank discussions, it was very apparent that all partners go to great lengths to protect our very important and most sensitive assets.
(C) As a result of the conference, the attendees agreed upon a mutual set of Guiding Principles to shape and facilitate our relationship with the Law Enforcement Community. Ultimately, all participants left the conference with a greater appreciation for each others commitment to supporting law enforcement, confidence in our procedures to protect each others equities, and a better understanding as to how the laws of each country works in that protection.
(U) Notes:
*CSE, DSD, GCHQ, and GCSB are the SIGINT agencies for Canada, Australia, the UK and New Zealand, respectively.
