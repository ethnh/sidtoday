(C) SINIO Council Sponsors a Brownbag Seminar on Chinese Coercion of Taiwan, 1100-1300, Tuesday, 6 January 2004 in 2B4118-6.
(U) For more than 50 years, Beijing and Taipei have glared across the Taiwan Strait in a quiet yet tense staredown with the future of the Chinese nation at stake. In the 21st century, changing dynamics in cross-Strait relations - including military balance of power, economic integration, demographics and expectations, and perceptions of US political will to intervene in a conflict - have touched on a fundamental question: If China attacked, could it take Taiwan?
(C) Join us in 2B4118-6 for a discussion of a recently completed National Intelligence Estimate concerning Chinese Coercion of Taiwan. Two of the NIE's drafters, from CIA and DIA, will discuss their findings and other issues associated with this Estimate. The seminar is open to all fully cleared US citizens. There is no registration; attendance is first-come, first-serve. POCs for this seminar are Tim Miner, SINIO for East Asia and Marilyn Maines, D/Ch for Strategic Intelligence Issues
