(S//SI) Trum Soule and 0 members of the Middle East/North Africa/South Asia IMT*, traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan from 15 - 21 May to assess first-hand how SIGINT is supporting our military and political efforts in the region. They were able to meet with key customers in the region for a report on where we stand, especially regarding SIGINT support for efforts to capture al-Qa'ida leadership. The men also were happy for the opportunity to talk with NSA'ers working in the region, to exchange information on developments both local and at Ft Meade. They gained a true appreciation for the difficult conditions under which personnel in theater work, and recognized the heroic efforts they put forth in the Global War on Terrorism.
