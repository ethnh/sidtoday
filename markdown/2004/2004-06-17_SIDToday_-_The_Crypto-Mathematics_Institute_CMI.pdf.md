(U//FOUO) The Crypto-Mathematics Institute (CMI) is the oldest of the Learned Organizations at NSA. It was established by Lieutenant General John A. Samford, Director, NSA, in a memorandum dated October 1957. The CMI has been an integral part of the mathematics community at NSA ever since its inception.
(U//FOUO) The purpose of the Institute is to promote those aspects of mathematics which pertain to cryptology and to provide a focal point for the NSA mathematics community in fields of common interest. Its membership is open to anyone with an interest in crypto-mathematics.
(U//FOUO) CMI sponsors a variety of social and scholarly events, often in conjunction with an Agency office or the Professional Health Program (PHP). For example, CMI and the Mathematics PHP co-sponsored a talk on June 3, 2004 by Professor Ron Rivest, the "R" in RSA*. Regular CMI activities include a monthly newsletter and seminar. Annually, CMI hosts a pizza luncheon for newly hired mathematicians and an all-day classified mathematics conference called Mathfest. The main social event and celebration of professional highlights is the annual awards banquet at the end of the academic year.
(U//FOUO) The Institute bestows a variety of honors at the annual banquet: essay contest prizes, Distinguished Memberships, CMI President's Award, and CMI Teaching Award.

- The CMI Essay Contest was established in 1959 to recognize outstanding written contributions to the fields of mathematics and cryptology.
- The Distinguished Members form the CMI Hall of Fame, drawn from retirees in the extended classified mathematics community.
- Since 1978, the CMI President's Award (or mathematician of the year) has recognized Agency personnel who are making important contributions to the mission of the cryptologic community through the development and application of the science of mathematical cryptology.
- The CMI Teaching Award was established in 1997 to honor important teaching contributions to the mathematics community.
(U//FOUO) A complete listing of CMI officers and activities appears on the CMI internal website, (or "go cmi").
