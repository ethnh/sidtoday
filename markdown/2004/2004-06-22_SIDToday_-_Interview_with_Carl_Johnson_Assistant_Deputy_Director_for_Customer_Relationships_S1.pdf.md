(U//FOUO) Here's another in our series of interviews with SID leaders. Today's interview is with Carl Johnson of the Customer Relationships Directorate (CRD, S1)

- What was your first job at the Agency?
(S//SI) My first job at NSA, May 1976, was as an Air Force Traffic Analyst. I was part of a team hand-picked by General Ardisana to update the technical health of the primary threat - USSR. The project was called "PULSEBEAT" and I was personally responsible for updating Soviet Long Range Aviation and Airborne Command Post TEXTA.
(S//SI) I was assigned to A62 wherein I applied knowledge learned on my previous assignment as a Soviet Radioprinter Analyst in Misawa, Japan. These were exciting times, mainly because the Soviet Union was our most immediate threat and A Group was the biggest target effort at NSA. This was a great way to be introduced to NSA and to get "knee deep" in traffic analytic technical learning.
- What was the most memorable experience you've had during your career?
(S//SI) Managing the EP-3 Crisis (emergency landing of the US Navy EP-3E reconnaissance aircraft on China's Hainan Island) while Chief of the China and Korea Product Line. My most important concern was getting our air crew out of China safely and quickly. A huge bonus would be getting the aircraft returned to the U.S. but that was ancillary to freeing our crew. When that crew was released, I breathed a big sigh of relief. When they walked into my office at NSA, I was very near tears looking at how young they were -- truly a highlight of my career!
- What is the biggest challenge facing your organization right now?
(U//FOUO) Making CRD a full partner within the SID construct. We (CRD) view our business as a vital and integral part of the SIGINT production continuum. CRD is the focal point of much of the day-to-day interactions with our customers, but all of us in SID are in the fight together. We are working hard to emphasize and reinforce how the collective efforts of all of us in SID -- together with those of the IAD -- support the SIGINT and national defense missions. We all must share more broadly, perform analysis and report faster-yet-precisely, and work against our highest priorities. It takes the full SID complement to make us successful and a failure by any part could lead to the collapse of any other part.
- What is the most exciting project for the future that your org is currently undertaking?
(S//SI) CRD is the leading edge of SIGINT. We work to understand clients and to ensure their satisfaction. We have projects underway to make both the clients and our fellow co-producers understand the total picture better. JOURNEYMAN aims to assist analysts and reporters perform their jobs better and more efficiently. IN Matcher will save our work force time by automating IN selection. Tool developments will further enhance reporting capability and will help analysts/ reporters/ linguists write better products. New products and services will be more futuristic to meet transformation goals and client needs. As we disperse mission to gain efficiencies and for better mission assurance, the DSOC model is instructive on how CRD will engage customers. New policies that are aggressive and progressive are being written. We're providing support to troops and crises in unprecedented ways, to include having over 100 NSA persons in harm's way. These are exciting times and CRD is out front for SID.
