(S//SI//REL) NSA was thanked on 8 January 2004 by the Norwegian Intelligence Service for tipping them off to an al-Qaida threat to the Norwegian embassy in Cairo, as reported by the A\&P Egyptian shop (North African Relations Branch - S2E32) late 6 January. SIGINT from NSA to NIS was Norway's only source of this threat information.
(U) Events unfolded as follows:

- (S//SI) The Egyptian shop, the Office of Counterterrorism, and NSOC generated key reports with tearlines for distribution inside the SIGINT community and to US and appropriate foreign partners.
- (S//SI) The information was delivered electronically by the Oslo SLO (SIGINT Liaison Officer), with a personal phone call to the head of International Operations at the NIS.
- (S//SI) NIS followed-up by contacting Norwegian Police (PST) and Ministry of Foreign Affairs elements, who were highly interested in this information, and deliberated over follow-up actions. They have since sent a team to Cairo to assess Norwegian embassy security there.
- (S) The Norwegian ambassador closed Cairo embassy as a precaution.
(S//SI//REL) This timely threat tipper has underscored for the Norwegian Government that they may truly be the targets of terrorist activity, and they are taking steps accordingly. Well done to all NSA'ers involved!
