(U//FOUO) SID today recently posted its 500th article -- a major milestone since its inception 11+ months ago. We'd like to take this opportunity to repost instructions for making SID today your browser's default homepage, for those who wish to do so:

## (U//FOUO) In Netscape :

- Go to the SID today page.
- Then, on your Netscape browser window click on "edit".
- On the drop down menu at the bottom, click on "preferences".
- Choose the Navigator category.
- In the "Navigator starts with" box, select "Home page"
- In the Home page box click on "Use current page" (This is why you have to be on the SID today page when you start.)
- Then OK at the bottom of the window.
(U//FOUO) Test it by closing Netscape and then restarting it. SID today should be what you see when Netscape comes up.
(U//FOUO) Now, if you want to make getting back to SID today as simple as a single click, add it to you bookmarks. Then edit your bookmarks and put the SID today bookmark on your personal toolbar. A SID today block should show up in the 3rd level toolbar at the top of your browser window.


## (U//FOUO) In Explorer:

- Start on the SID today page.
- Click on "Tools"
- On the "Tools" menu choose "Internet Options".
- Click the "General" tab.
- In the Home page area, click "use current" and then OK.
- Click on "Favorites" and add it to your favorites list.
(U//FOUO) This will make it easy to catch the next 500 articles!
