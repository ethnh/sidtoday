# (U) Another Successful Olympics Story 

FROM:
Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (S3C)
Run Date: 10/06/2004
(S//SI) Like the athletes themselves, Data Acquisition (DA) expended countless hours in preparation for the 2004 Athens Olympics. The Collection Strategies and Requirements Center (CSRC) Olympics Strategists worked with people and organizations from across the Extended Enterprise to create a SIGINT Campaign Strategy focusing on support to the Games. Unlike the athletes, when the Olympics are over, the NSA team is hoping you won't even know they were there. Instead of Olympic gold, their goal was making sure the Olympics proceeded without terrorist incident and that the approximately 10,500 athletes from over 200 countries, millions of fans, and the international press could focus on the sporting events in the Olympic spirit of peaceful competition.

## (S//SI) Starting in 2002, CSRC Strategists, and

worked with Customer Relations Division (CRD) and external customers to document previously unstated Information Needs. Teaming with SIGDEV and Analysis and Production (A\&P) to ensure that an analytic attack was in place and that targets' social networks were defined, these strategists examined the evolving communications network being built for the Games, determined gaps in SIGINT access, and directed fielding of collection and forwarding systems. And all this was before the torch was lit signifying the Opening of the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad. In short, the team followed the SID Operating Principles to systematically analyze what our customers needed and planned how the SIGINT system would meet those needs.
(S//SI) When the plan went into the implementation phase, the CSRC monitored the effort. This was simplified through the use of an Info Work Space (IWS) virtual room dedicated to the Games, which allowed Intelligence Community professionals from across the Extended Enterprise, including Denver, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA) 24/7 multiINT Olympic watch, NSAW, and those deployed in Athens itself, to coordinate operations smoothly.
(TS//SI) Given the broad scope of the Games, all DA Groups played a part in improving access, collection, and forwarding of traffic. For example, prior to the start of the Olympics:

- Commercial Technologies Group worked with vendors to learn about communications being installed to support the Olympics;
- CSRC gathered data from CIA documenting the GSM networks active in Athens;
- Special Source Operations improved mid-point cable access to DNI and voice targets in Greece;
- SCS Athens fielded additional capabilities to bring traffic back to NSAW;
- Tailored Access Operations performed CNE operations against Greek communications providers.

Additional support during the Games included fielding three remote collection teams (one each from Link Access, Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services, and the SCS) active in the Athens area to fill collection gaps.
(S//SI) After this year's gold medal performance, what comes next? Well, the CSRC started looking into the issues of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy months ago.
