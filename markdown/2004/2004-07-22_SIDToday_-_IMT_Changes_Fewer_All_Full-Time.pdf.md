# (S//SI) IMT Changes: Fewer, All Full-Time

Run Date: 07/22/2004
(S//SI) SID leadership recently announced major changes to the Issue Management Team (IMT) program. These changes are the result of a careful review of the first 18 months of the program by a team of experts led by Jeanne Zimmer. The changes result in fewer IMTs, but with a fullfledged effort directed against each remaining focal area. Effective 12 July, the number of IMTs was reduced by half, scaling down from fourteen IMTs to seven. In some cases, two of the old IMTs were merged to form a single new IMT; in other cases IMTs were dissolved. In addition, while some of the old IMTs worked on a part-time basis, all of the new IMTs will be full-time positions.
(S//SI) Here's a rundown of the "before" and "after":

| Pre-7/12 IMTs | Current IMTs |
| :-- | :-- |
| - Iraq |  |
| - Counterterrorism | Iraq |
| - Combating Proliferation | - Counterterrorism |
| - Asia-Pacific | - Combatting Proliferation |
| - Korea | - Asia-Pacific (incl. Korea) |
| - Latin America | - Latin America/Crime \& Narcotics |
| - Counternarcotics and Int'l Crime | - MENA |
| - MENA/Stans/India \& Pakistan | - Sub-Saharan Africa/Europe |
| - Africa |  |
| - Europe |  |
| - CounterintelligenceÂ |  |
| - Weapons \& Space |  |
| - Global Geopolitical IssuesÂ |  |
| - Information Operations |  |

(S//SI) Other changes are being enacted, as well:

- SID leadership will put in place two senior, full-time IMT advisors to help all of the new teams. (Jeanne Zimmer is already at work, and is scheduled to join her.)
- Leaders are drawing up an IMT CONOP (Concept of Operations), incorporating input from current and former IMT members.
- Needed resources (budget, space, etc.) will be identified.
- SID will name initial areas of concentration for each of the new IMTs.
(S//SI) The IMTs' job is to concentrate on strategic planning, assessing the end-to-end performance of the SIGINT System against each topic. Since the IMT initiative has been so successful in dealing with crises in Iraq and elsewhere, the teams are "here to stay." In the words of Signals Intelligence Director MG Quirk, these changes represent "the next step in the journey," as the directorate finds the best IMT structure to suit operational needs.
