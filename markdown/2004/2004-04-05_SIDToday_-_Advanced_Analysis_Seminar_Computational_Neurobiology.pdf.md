(U//FOUO) You are invited to the following presentation:
Topic: Mechanization of Intelligence -- Computational Neurobiology
Speaker: Dr. Hecht-Nielsen
Affiliation: Fair Isaac Corporation
Date/Time: April 6, 2004 [Tuesday] 1000-1200
Location: Ops2B Conference Ctr, 2B4118-3
(U//FOUO) The topic of this lecture is the description of the underlying mathematical basis of cognition. The main thrust of this talk will cover Confabulation (outlined in pages 2-11 in the document below).
(U) Here is a summary of confabulation quoted from the paper referenced below:
"The main research program of Artificial Intelligence has been to find some sort of reasoning process that can account for animal cognition. Confabulation, a symbolic prediction technique introduced here, is the antithesis of this program. Instead of trying to reason from assumed facts to conclusions, it uses a strange from of knowledge to rule out unreasonable outcomes; leaving a core set of not-unreasonable possibilities is called an expectation. Then, employing the same knowledge in a different way, it identifies the highest quality conclusions in the expectation. Unlike reasoning, which must employ highly refined and specific knowledge that is difficult and expensive to obtain, confabulation uses a type of knowledge (conditional probabilities between pairs of symbols) that is simple and easy to obtained in the required vast quantities. The recently discovered neuronal Marder/Turigiano/Hebb learning principle produces this kind of knowledge. Confabulation is proposed as the underlying mechanism of all vertebrate cognition."
(U) Dr. Hecht-Nielsen proposes that these discoveries will profoundly impact how artificial intelligence techniques are applied to a wide variety of problems.
