(U//FOUO) The SINIO Council and the National Cryptologic School are pleased to present one in a series of Strategic Intelligence Issue Seminars for Summer 2004. "By Listening and Learning: Adversarial Attempts To Foil the US Intelligence Gathering System" will be presented by
(1) SINIO for Information Operations and Denial and Deception, on Tuesday, 29 June, from 1130-1300 in Room 2N044. Advanced registration is required - instructions follow.

# (U) Course Overview: 

(S) A day hasn't gone by that our adversaries haven't picked up a newspaper or gone on the Internet to learn something new about how the US intelligence gathering system operates and what its capabilities or limitations are. And in response, a day hasn't gone by that our adversaries haven't modified their operations and activities to avoid being detected and collected against by the US intelligence gathering system. From US military operations to domestic public discussions on intelligence "failures," our adversaries are learning and developing ways to foil our intelligence gathering system, sometimes with the simplest, inexpensive low-tech tool to defeat our expensive, high-tech systems. This class will highlight some of the latest denial \& deception programs that our adversaries are employing and will encourage participants to think about and discuss ways to identify and counter these programs, particularly those that have the potential to "deafen" our SIGINT system.
