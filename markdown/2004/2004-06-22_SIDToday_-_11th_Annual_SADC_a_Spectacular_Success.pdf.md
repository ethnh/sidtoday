(U//FOUO) May 24, 2004 heralded the 11th annual Signals Analysis Development Conference (SADC) held at NSA. Sponsored by Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services (S31), the SADC is a technical conference spanning all disciplines of Signals Analysis (SA). Over 400 members of the Intelligence Community (IC) representing more than 30 field sites and 2nd Party Partner sites around the world attended briefings, discussions, training sessions, tool demonstrations and tours of several facilities at the Fort Meade campus.
(U//FOUO) The conference began with keynote addresses by:

- MG Richard J. Quirk, Director of Signals Intelligence,
- Mr. Fran Landolf, Chief of Cryptanalysis and Exploitation Services,
- Branch Head, Communications Signals Analysis, Research \& Development, GCHQ, and
- LTC Joseph Pacileo, Chief of CES/Signal Survey and Analysis.
(U//FOUO) Afterwards, Signals Analysis Skill Community Advocate, presented the 7th Annual Signals Analysis Skill Community Awards. The GOLD PULSE AWARD , presented to , recognizes exceptional technical excellence and contribution to the SA community. is a senior signals analyst at Menwith Hill Station. The Charlie Tevis Community Service Award, presented to , Signals Analysis Skill Community Director, recognizes exceptional service and contributions to the SA Community.
(U//FOUO) This year's theme, "Signals Analysis: Following Through to SIGINT Successes" was mirrored by the diverse range of presentations. Subjects of the talks encompassed every aspect of signals analysis, including technical analysis of specific signals, error correction, data network intelligence solutions, software developments and new signal technologies. From bit level analysis to target development, the presentations of this year's conference highlighted the efforts of signals analysts along the path towards successful sustained production of SIGINT.
(U//FOUO) Conference attendees had opportunities to attend tours of cutting-edge laboratories and operations centers around the NSA campus. Tours offered included the DNI Lab (S31212), the Forensics Lab (S31151), the Anechoic Chamber (S3163), the Tordella Super Computer Building, the Technical Exploitation Center (S31123), and the National Cryptologic Museum.
(U//FOUO) With this year's success, the SADC continues to gain recognition as a vital analysis conference, contributing to all aspects of SIGINT production. In addition to advancing technical awareness, the SADC facilitated teamwork across the extended IC enterprise by developing an awareness of current developments and capabilities of all stakeholders. This familiarity with our own expertise builds and strengthens the social network that is the channel for following through to SIGINT successes.
(U//FOUO) The enthusiasm of all the participants and their continuing appreciative feedback has made the 2004 SADC a shining success!
