(U//FOUO) Information Needs' 10-minute Satisfaction Survey
FROM:
CRD Communications (S109)
Run Date: 10/27/2004
(U//FOUO) Can you spare 10 minutes to indicate how you use Information Needs in the course of your work producing or enabling SIGINT?
(U//FOUO) What: The Information Needs Division/S111 is conducting a 10-minute on-line survey of SID and extended enterprise personnel to ascertain how INs are used in their respective SIGINT production and enabling efforts, what portions of INs are most and least useful in those efforts, to what extent INs are used in making SIGINT tasking and resource decisions, and how INs could be made more useful to SIGINT efforts.
(U//FOUO) When: Now through 30 November 2004.
(U//FOUO) Who: SID and extended enterprise analysts, managers, and SIGINT enablers are encouraged to complete the survey.
(U//FOUO) Where: On NSANet type "no nsrn" -- or click here:
(U//FOUO) Why a survey? We want to assess NSA analysts' satisfaction with the clarity and precision of customers needs and priorities. This is one of the measures underpinning the SID Strategic Plan:

- SID Strategic Goal 1: Make the customer an active participant in steering the SIGINT system.
- Objective 1.1: Collaborate and integrate with customers and partners to improve identification of key decision points, information needs, opportunities and priorities.
- Measure 1.1.3: Internal analyst satisfaction with clarity/precision of customers needs and priorities.
(U//FOUO) Your responses are key to the future direction of SID's future management of customers' Information Needs, and will be used as a basis for developing and prioritizing any needed enhancements to the IN processes and tools. The results of the survey will be incorporated into the efforts of the CINR IPT, and compiled and posted to the NSRP website later this fall. Thank you in advance for your assistance in this effort.
