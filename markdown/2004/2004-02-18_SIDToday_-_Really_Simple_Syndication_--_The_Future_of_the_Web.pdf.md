(U) Do you ever wish you could view the latest reporting from dozens of different sources from a single web page? Do you wish you could pick the means by which this information was delivered to you? Would you like the convenience of viewing Agency-all e-mails and DIRgrams from either Outlook or via the web without filling up your inbox?
(U) All this and much more is possible using RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, one of the fastest growing technologies on the Internet. RSS is an XML standard for content syndication in other words, making your content easily available to other web sites and other applications.
(C//SI) In NSOC, we are using RSS technology to populate the content of the NSOC Olympics support page ("go nsoc-olympics"). Using RSS, we are able to display the latest news items from the Global SIGINT Highlights, the Enduring Freedom Summaries, the DIA Early Bird, the Classified World News, and other sources of data on a single web page. As the summer approaches, we will be adding additional RSS feeds to our site, so that the NSOC Olympics page will be a true information portal, as opposed to just a "page of links."
(U) However, don't make the mistake that RSS is only for news items. Database queries, audio, video, equipment health and status, and many other sources of data are just some of the types of information sources that can be syndicated via RSS. Basically, if you can define a URL to your data, you can syndicate it via RSS.
(U) On the Internet, data sources as varied as Dilbert, ESPN Sports news, bankrate.com mortgage news, and Microsoft security updates are all available via RSS. At last count, there were over one million RSS feeds available on the web, with more being added every hour.
(U) RSS has the potential to revolutionize the way we view the web, both at home and here at work. For more information on how RSS technology could be used in your organization, contact
