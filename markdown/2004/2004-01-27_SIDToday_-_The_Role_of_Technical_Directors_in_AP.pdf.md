(U//FOUO) Jim Allen sent the following message to the S2 workforce on January 12:
(U//FOUO) In an effort to strengthen the roles of Technical Directors at the most senior levels within A\&P, I have formed a team of Technical Directors and senior managers to consider several issues. Members comprise:

(U//FOUO) The basic tasks and deliverables for the team are as follows:

1. Describe the duties, responsibilities, and outputs of Technical Directors. The goal is to identify which are applicable across Production Line's and Production Service equivalents.
2. Identify what, if any, additional roles/responsibilities would be inappropriate.
3. Describe the authorities for Technical Directors.
4. Review the draft Technical Leadership Council Charter for consistency with team's views on Technical Directors.
5. Outline the qualifications, selection process, expected duration of term, and notional follow-on assignments for Technical Directors.
(U//FOUO) This is to be something of a clean-sheet exercise, and will include work done previously by many thoughtful people. Nothing is off-limits to the group in coming to a workable solution, and I expect several new ideas will surface. I don't expect TD's in different organizations to be uniform, but the title should imply a common core. Although we are focused on senior TD's initially, I hope that the results will help us with issues affecting technical experts throughout the organization.
(U//FOUO) The team will present their results to me on 28 January and to the A\&P Senior Leadership Team on 29 January. I'll keep you informed.
