(U) Analysis \& Production Executive Leadership Team Sums Up Challenges

FROM: Jim Allen
Deputy Director, Analysis \& Production
Run Date: 07/28/2004
(U) We made important progress, last week, toward realizing the Director's vision of a transformed global enterprise. We convened a meeting of the A\&P Executive Leadership Team to address strategic issues, to include governance, resources, hiring, training, and operational issues. We made good headway on all.
(U//FOUO)The A\&P ELT is comprised of:

- DDAP, Jim Allen
- A/DDAP,
- A/DD for Production,
- Chief, Production Services,
- GRSOC Commander, Colonel Rob Carr, USA
- KRSOC Commander, Captain USN
- MRSOC Commander, Colonel USAF
- Chief of Staff,
- Chief of Operations and Chairman of PMC,
- A\&P Tech Director, Jack Israel
(U) Composition may be adjusted a bit as we go forward, but the ELT is the most senior body in A\&P. This is not the first time we've done business, but it is the first time we've had the entire ELT together to conduct it's primary functions.
Which are to:
- define major mission areas,
- apportion resources across mission areas,
- set strategic direction for and priorities of A\&P activities worldwide,
- produce standards and goals,
- set architecture and technology investment,
- set personnel hiring and development targets,
- establish measurement and assessment, and
- achieve synchronization with rest of the corporation.
(U) The ELT agreed that Product Line Leaders (PLL's) will:
- determine distribution of analytic effort within and across a major mission area,
- apply resources within mission areas,
- ensure adherence to standards and goals,
- assess and adjust distribution of analytic effort,
- identify production gaps that may be satisfied through partnerships,
- develop roadmaps/processes to achieve goals in work force strategy for the specific mission area,
- drive requirements for uniform interoperable functional capabilities, and
- manage effective expenditure of resources within the mission area.
(U) This clarity is helpful, but we still have work to do in redefining our terminology and operating concepts. For example, PLL and Production Manager are today almost synonymous, and they are usually identified with the idea of a "Target Office of Primary Interest, (TOPI)" which conjures an image of a set of people behind a particular door vice a distributed analytic community. Organizations are evolving, but not fast enough to keep up with the way we are operating.
(C) A\&P has already and will continue to enjoy much of the growth in NSA/CSS's population over
the next few years. If current plans stay on track, we could reach as many as 8200 members by the end of FY09. The time to think about the skill sets, geographic distribution, and other questions is now. Our intention is to base the answers to those questions on mission to the maximum extent possible. PLL's will propose a strawman at the next ELT, probably by the end of August, which will ultimately result in recommendations from us, initially to the SIGINT Director.
(U) Simultaneous with the strategic planning effort, we are identifying actions we need to take now and next year to move mission to other parts of the enterprise or to augment missions already there. I'll provide more detail on those initiatives when I have enough meaningful detail, but among the early actions will be steps to shore up our global effort against Counterterrorism and Counterproliferation -- quickly.
