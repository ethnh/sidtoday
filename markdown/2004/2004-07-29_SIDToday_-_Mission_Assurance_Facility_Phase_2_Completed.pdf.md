Run Date: 07/29/2004
(TS//REL) Another important milestone has been reached in the effort to protect SID's vital processing and analysis assets against catastrophic destruction. Phase 2 of the Interim Mission Assurance Facility, known as has been completed on schedule.
(TS/REL) You may recall that $\square$ is to be accomplished in 4 phases. The focus of Phase 1 was on developing the strategy, finding a Mission Assurance (MA) site, installing basic facilities, security, and IT infrastructure, initiating our Intellectual Capital Recovery and replicating CES (S31) mission processing capability off of the Fort Meade campus for the first time in NSA's 50 year history.
(TS//REL) Phase 2 has been the completion of some end-to-end threads by adding:

- Analysis \& Production (S2),
- Customer Relationships (S1),
- Finance,
- Business,
- HR, and
- Security systems
(TS//REL) As projected, the facilities are ready to accept these systems. LF and the Army Corps of Engineers (ACoE)has completed the construction of the facility. Q14 and Q15 (physical and technical security) have certified Phase 2 as a SCIF as of July 23, 2004. Boxes and parts for the first classified S2 system (mini-PINWALE) have already arrived at $\square$ Full mission population will take many more months.
(TS//REL) We still have a long way to go. However, we remain on schedule, and within budget. This would not have been possible without the excellent support from LF and the ACoE, ITIS, Eagle Alliance, Security, and those in S1 and S2 who architected the systems.
(TS//REL) Although many challenges remain, due to the talent and dedication of countless individuals throughout SID and our partner organizations each day brings SID closer and closer to greater protection of our assets.
