(S//SI) Conference on GSM Collection in Iraq
FROM:
CSRC, Strategy Division (S3C2)
Run Date: 08/19/2004
(S//SI) Complicating the challenges facing Coalition Forces in Iraq is the rapidly growing presence of public GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) networks, providing insurgents with a ready means of communication. And the forecast for the future promises to be an even greater challenge for both tactical and national SIGINT collectors and analysts as these networks grow and multiply.
(S//SI) In response, the Strategy Division of CSRC (Collection Strategies and Requirements Center) hosted the National-Tactical Iraqi GSM Collection Conference on 4-5 August 2004. The purpose of the conference was to consider options relating to the improved integration of collection efforts throughout the SIGINT system against Iraq's developing GSM networks and to increase the capability to provide actionable intelligence to Coalition Forces in Iraq.
(S//SI) More than 70 analysts, linguists, and collectors from throughout the U.S. Intelligence and Military communities, as well as representatives from GCHQ, participated in the two-day conference. Following briefings on Iraq's GSM infrastructure, national and tactical collection efforts, and geo-location strategies, conference participants discussed a number of Iraqi GSM issues including signals development responsibilities, leveraging the unique capabilities of the Cryptologic Support Teams (CSTs) deploying to Iraq, and improving national support to tactical collection and development efforts. Along with building relationships and identifying responsibilities with our community partners, a number of outstanding issues were assigned for action at the conference's conclusion, ensuring the momentum started at the conference would continue.
