(U) The office of China and Korea and the SINIO Council cordially invite you and your colleagues to attend the NSA China Forum scheduled for 6 May from 1000 to 1200 at the R\&E Symposium Center on the Fort Meade campus. This is the fourth installment of an ongoing series that is meant to not only inform the workforce about issues involving China, but overall greater East Asian security challenges. This month's NSA China Forum is entitled "Northeast Asian Security: Moving Toward A Regional Security Framework?"
(U) Dr. Kurt Campbell, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies International Security Program, will lead the unclassified discussion. Professor Robert Sutter of Georgetown University and Dr. Kongdan Oh of the Institute for Defense Analyses will also provide presentations on this increasingly important issue.
(U) We have requested that the speakers consider the following questions when formulating their presentations:

1. Has the Six-Party Talks process set the stage for the emergence of an East Asian multilateral security framework?
2. Has participation in the Six-Party Talks facilitated the amelioration of ties between Japan and China? If so, will the improvement last?
3. Is the emergence of a regional security organization in Washington's interest?
4. What role would North Korea play in a post-Six-Party Talks regional security architecture? Is it possible for Pyongyang to play a role other than target?
5. If a regional security arrangement is established in the wake of the North Korean nuclear issue, will it be possible to include cross-Strait relations as an issue for discussion within that framework?
