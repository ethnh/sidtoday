(U//FOUO) TRAILBLAZER is no longer just a concept, but an unfolding reality -- something the analysts can put their hands on.
(U//FOUO) In August 2004 the Technology Demonstration Platform (TDP) portion of TRAILBLAZER, in a Beta version, will begin its Operational Assessment at the hands of 20 analysts. As FY05 dawns and progresses, a total of 100 mission users at NSAW and 35 users from the Extended Enterprise will test subsequent spirals of the TDP capabilities. MG Quirk, Signals Intelligence Director, recognizes the significance of this event and will kick off the orientation for the Operational Assessment analysts today, 16 June 2004.
(S//SI) The TDP Beta version will demonstrate capabilities that enable the operational application of "Hunt vs. Gather." Transformational capabilities such as single sign-on, single query across multiple knowledge bases, advanced storage, content summarization, and native viewing will all be demonstrated across a mission (Counterterrorism) thread. Capabilities that enable mission tools will also be demonstrated, and will include information-extraction applications such as entity extraction, content categorization, entity relationships, embedded multilingual processes, and a metadata process to track traffic and enhance collection.
(S//SI) Although the TDP Beta is the first delivery of TRAILBLAZER capabilities, the fact is that over the last couple of years, TRAILBLAZER has sponsored a variety of programs that have directly supported the transformation of SIGINT operations. These contributions include:

- the rapid prototyping of critical mission applications such as the CES (Cryptanalysis and Expolitation Services - S31) development of a new generation of DNI* processing (WEALTHYCLUSTER),
- smart packet filters (TUMBRIL),
- the first strategic knowledge base, the Target Knowledge Base (TKB),
- the DNE* viewer which was integrated into AGILEVIEW DNI viewer, and the
- Target Operational Pilot series of rapid prototypes and pilot programs which have been the basis for mission applications development and the part-time integree program.
