FROM: SID Account Manager for the White House (S112)
(S) We can be proud that our Signals Intelligence product is highly regarded and regularly used at the highest level of the Executive Branch. On a daily basis SIGINT reaches President Bush in the President's Terrorist Threat Report; presented by his national security advisor; summarized by the Situation Room staff in their twice-a-day, one-page President's Summary; directly, in the form of the President's Daily Briefing (PDB), or indirectly, woven into PDB all-source articles and separate SIGINT reports presented by the PDB briefer.
(S) In addition to the President, a number of high level White House officials and National Security Council (NSC) staff members also receive and use SIGINT as they formulate and coordinate national security policy. These include Vice President Cheney, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Condoleezza Rice (the "National Security Advisor"), Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Stephen Hadley, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor to the Vice President I. Lewis Libby, about eighty special assistants to the President (senior directors) and directors on the NSC staff, national security assistants and advisors to the Vice President, and a few others.
(S//SI) Feedback from the White House shows that SIGINT makes profound contributions to their work and decisions. Some examples:

- the text of a presidential speech to a large foreign audience was altered a few days before it was delivered due to SIGINT reporting;
- SIGINT about a foreign government was so timely and important that two NSC special assistants to the President immediately took it to the National Security Advisor, who read it and right away walked it directly into the Oval Office to discuss it with the President;
- SIGINT alerted an NSC official of a foreign representative's intentions to call him that afternoon and the subject of the call, therefore helping him to prepare;
- the National Security Advisor used SIGINT to prepare the President for a visit by a head of state;
- during his daily intelligence briefing (the PDB), the President read a 3-page SIGINT summary report regarding terrorism in its entirety.

Our work at NSA impacts the highest levels of our national government, on a daily basis affecting their work, actions and decisions. As the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Near East and North African Affairs, Ambassador Elliott Abrams told two of his directors who were preparing to visit NSA one day last year, "Tell NSA that we love them!"
(U) How does SIGINT get to the top?
(S) The White House Situation Room (WHSR) is critical to ensuring that our SIGINT reports (and a great variety of other kinds of information) are disseminated to the appropriate officials at the White House. All SIGINT addressed to the White House arrives electronically in the Situation Room, which is located on the ground floor of the West Wing. Three duty officers scan each incoming item (be it SIGINT or another source), determine who needs to see it, and disseminate the item accordingly, sometimes adding a very short summary or background information. Across West Executive Avenue from the West Wing, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, NSC staff members can access the SIGINT at their workstations. Items for the National Security Advisor and other West Wing officials are placed in their read folders that are kept in the Sit Room or sent electronically to their executive assistants.
(S) Duty officers in the Sit Room, two of whom are NSAers, often include SIGINT in the twice-aday WHSR President's Summary. Also, the WHSR senior intelligence officer (a position that since its inception has been held by an NSAer, currently (SIGINT) forwards select NSA tippers and other SIGINT reports, along with a short summary highlighting the reports' importance, to NSC senior directors and others based on their expressed intelligence needs.
(U) Interactions between the SID and the White House take place virtually every day, among NSC staffers, SIGINT National Intelligence Officers (SINIOs), NSOC, experts from several target offices in Analysis and Production, the SID senior executive account manager (SEAM), the account manager, the Sit Room senior intelligence analyst, and the deputy director of the Sit Room
