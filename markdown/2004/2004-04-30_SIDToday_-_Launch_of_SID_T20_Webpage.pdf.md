(U//FOUO) Today, the SID Transformation 2.0 webpage is being launched! The purpose of this webpage is to give the SID population a chance to weigh-in on the T2.0 initiative. To get to the page, type "go sid-t2" in your browser.
(U//FOUO) In his five papers that outline his vision:

- Transformation 2.0 - Cryptology as a Team Sport
- Teaming between SID and IAD
- Teaming Across the Entire Enterprise - no more Them and Us!
- Teaming with our Intelligence and Information Assurance Partners.
- Teaming with our Clients. It's not about us; it's about The U.S.
... Gen. Hayden has given us the "what".
(U//FOUO) As members of SID, we are now charged with developing the "how" that will make the vision a reality. You can find these documents as well as other pertinent information including the new Concept of Operations under Resource Documents on the SID T2 webpage.
(U//FOUO) Unique features of the SID T2 page are the Discussion Board and the Opinion Papers portions. The Discussion Board enables non-realtime "chat" giving SIGINT-ers around the world the opportunity to have a conversation about the T2.0 concept. The Opinion Papers section is a place to post white papers, think pieces, or the like that contain a more in-depth expression of your thoughts and ideas on the subject of information sharing.
(U) Don't miss this chance to let your ideas and thoughts be known.
