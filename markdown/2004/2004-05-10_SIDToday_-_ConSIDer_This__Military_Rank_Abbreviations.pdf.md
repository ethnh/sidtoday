(U) In honor of Armed Forces Week...
(U) Civilians: do you know how to abbreviate U.S. military ranks? Each military service uses its own abbreviation scheme. For example, the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps all use the rank of lieutenant colonel, but they abbreviate this rank as LTC, Lt Col (with a blank space), and LtCol (without a space), respectively.
(U) As you can see in the tables below, the Army and Navy use upper case in their abbreviations, while the Air Force and Marine Corps generally use a combination of upper and lower case. Note also that certain ranks are used by only one military branch; this is especially true in the case of the Navy:
