(U//FOUO) A new SID policy document, SID Management Directive 430, "Afghanistan SIGINT Coalition," which was signed by the SIGINT Director on 8 January, establishes the role and membership of the Afghanistan SIGINT Coalition (AFSC), the procedures for adding and subtracting AFSC members, and the process for releasing NSA/CSS SIGINT information to AFSC partners.
(S//REL) The Afghanistan SIGINT Coalition (AFSC) is a U.S.-led coalition of First, Second, and Third Party SIGINT partners engaged at a significant operational level in Afghanistan, combining SIGINT expertise and information to achieve shared operational goals in a multilateral analytic environment focused on the Afghan theater. The Afghanistan Mission Lead from the Deputy Directorate for Analysis and Production (DDAP) -- referred to as the DDAP Afghanistan Mission Lead -- chairs the coalition. The initial nine members consisted of the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, France, and the Netherlands. Germany's and Sweden's SIGINT organizations joined the AFSC last year to currently make it a total of 11 members. The AFSC members apply their national SIGINT capabilities and expertise to address common SIGINT requirements in support of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.
